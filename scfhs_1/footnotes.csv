Notes relating to this dataset,,,,,,,
"1 Figures are for deaths occurring, rather than deaths registered in each calendar year. ONS are not usually notified of a death until it has been registered, so figures may be an underestimate and subsequent updates to this dataset may not match the figures presented here.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
2 Figures exclude deaths of non-residents of England or Wales based on boundaries as of February 2016,,,,,,,
3 Deaths where the day or month of death were unknown have been excluded from this dataset. The number of such deaths is very small,,,,,,,
