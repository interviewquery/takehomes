This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network\u2019s default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.\n\nThe greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. \u201cThis is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConsumers\u2019 seemingly benign activities \u2014 their likes \u2014 could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior. And not just by unknown third parties. Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, describing its services in a company case study as \u201cinfluencing voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,\u201d said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIf your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone\u2019s life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.\n\nIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201d\n\nIn May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission \u2014 opting in rather than opting out \u2014 after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201d\n\nBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\n\nPrivacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.\n\nIn 2010, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers, called Do Not Track. Two years later, the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.\n\n\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.\n\nThe business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.\n\nThat would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.\n\n\u201cTo know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,\u201d said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world\u2019s remedy for any problem is always more technology.\n\n\u201cIf Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,\u201d said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. \u201cBut well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix.

He said the bank was trying to cover up the fact that it did not have the documents to prove some of its customers owed money it was trying to collect. To further his lawsuit, he opened his life to intense scrutiny, used vacation time at his new job to attend meetings and court dates, and told and retold the story of his experiences at the bank, which maintained that Mr. Tran had been fired for poor performance and that there had been no cover-up of missing documents. He would not go away.\n\n\u201cI have a story to tell,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThis is a true story. I blew the whistle. They all know.\u201d\n\nCaptured at 17\n\nMr. Tran calls himself Duke now, but his name at birth was Tran Duy Duc. He was born in Vietnam in 1961, the son of a colonel in the South Vietnamese military fighting alongside American troops. Mr. Tran was 13 when, in 1975, the North Vietnamese took over the government and sent his father to a prison camp as punishment for helping the Americans. When released four years later, Mr. Tran\u2019s father paid to sneak Mr. Tran over the Cambodian border.\n\n\u201cYou have to leave,\u201d his father told him.\n\nAs soon as he got to Cambodia, though, Mr. Tran was captured by fighters for the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. They forced him to drink vinegar, believing he had swallowed gold and family jewels that the vinegar would help expel. Then they made the 17-year-old their slave, forcing him to dig wells.\n\n\u201cSometimes the soldiers got drunk and took me out and put AK-47s to my head so I would pass out,\u201d Mr. Tran said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEight months after he was caught, Mr. Tran\u2019s captors traded him to aid workers who carried humanitarian supplies. He still remembers the items that bought his freedom: a kilo of rice, two boxes of canned tuna, two boxes of sardines in tomato sauce, antibiotics and some other medical supplies.\n\nThe aid workers took him to Thailand. From there, the International Organization for Migration helped him reach the United States.\n\n\u201cI am so grateful,\u201d Mr. Tran said. \u201cHere I am, an American citizen.\u201d\n\nHis first job in America was scrubbing pots in a restaurant kitchen. Soon after that, he got his first call center job, in the payment processing division of a local bank. He said in an interview that he had worked in call centers for a total of 25 years.\n\nIn 2002, he began working in a call center for Wells Fargo\u2019s collections unit in Vancouver, Wash. In March 2013, he transferred to another Wells Fargo unit, the home equity division, in nearby Beaverton, Ore.\n\nMr. Tran was proud of his work. In an interview, he described himself as \u201ca really model employee\u201d who got internal recognition at Wells for his good work.\n\nThe division was responsible for a portfolio of home-equity loans that Wells Fargo had bought from another company at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. As the bank examined the loans in 2013, employees realized that Wells Fargo was missing some of the paperwork that proved the borrowers owed money to the bank.\n\nPhoto\n\nTom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, confirmed the existence of the problem. He said 120 of the loans had initially appeared to be missing their underlying documents.\n\nMr. Goyda said the bank was confident that the loans Mr. Tran cited were valid and that it had handled them properly. He said Mr. Tran had only limited visibility of the bank\u2019s internal system and that he did not have access to all of the borrowers\u2019 information.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNine months into his new job, Mr. Tran answered a phone call from a Wells Fargo customer in Lexington, N.C. His name was Walter Coles.\n\nMr. Coles, who is now 88, had recently opened a letter that Wells Fargo sent to his wife, Jacqueline. He handled her affairs because she has Alzheimer\u2019s. The letter said that Mrs. Coles owed Wells Fargo nearly $90,000 and that if she did not pay within 90 days the bank would foreclose on the Coleses\u2019 house.\n\nMr. Coles had credit card accounts with Wells Fargo, but this was the first he had heard of any $90,000 loan. \u201cI knew that my wife hadn\u2019t taken out a mortgage,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMy house was paid off 35 years ago.\u201d\n\nSo he called Wells Fargo. On the phone with Mr. Tran, Mr. Coles asked for proof that his wife owed the money. Mr. Tran tried to pull up the Coles file on his computer, but he couldn\u2019t find the loan documents. He told Mr. Coles that they were missing.\n\nMr. Tran started calling various Wells Fargo offices to figure out what had happened, he said. He consulted bank archives in San Francisco and Roanoke, Va., to try to find the documents.\n\n\u201cWe were unable to locate the agreement. Document is not available,\u201d a Wells employee reported in an email to Mr. Tran, which was reviewed by The Times.\n\nAnother employee responded: \u201cWe have tried all avenues to find documents but no luck.\u201d\n\nMr. Tran talked to his boss, Peter LeDonne, about the situation. He said Mr. LeDonne had told him not to follow up with Mr. Coles. \u201cThey tell me: \u2018It\u2019s no problem. If the customer call back, you tell them it\u2019s a balloon,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tran recalled, referring to a type of loan that would require Mr. Coles to repay the owed amount all at once.\n\nThrough a Wells Fargo spokesman, Mr. LeDonne declined to comment for this article.\n\n\u2018Not Something We Would Share\u2019\n\nMr. Tran wasn\u2019t the only Wells employee to receive that advice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Coles was insisting that he and his wife had never borrowed any money in the first place. He was \u2014 reasonably, in Mr. Tran\u2019s view \u2014 demanding proof that any loan existed. Mr. Tran said he had shared his feelings with his boss.\n\nBefore long, Mr. Tran said, he received another unsettling customer phone call. This time, it was from a woman named Nancy who said the bank had told her that she owed $165,000. She said she had not taken out a loan.\n\n\u201cShe was really emotional,\u201d Mr. Tran said. \u201cShe said: \u2018I have all my children live in my home. I don\u2019t have money to pay. Where is my children going to live?\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce again, the bank had no paperwork to prove that the borrower owed the money, Mr. Tran said. He said he had complained to his supervisor, Mr. LeDonne, and his boss\u2019s boss.\n\n\u201cI told him this is a fraud, I cannot be a part of that. He got upset,\u201d Mr. Tran said.\n\nIn a court filing last year, Mr. LeDonne said: \u201cI had no knowledge that Mr. Tran reported or complained of what he believed to be an alleged Wells Fargo practice of deceiving customers regarding missing loan documents or other unlawful activities.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2014, Mr. Tran said, Mr. LeDonne called him into an office. A group of Mr. Tran\u2019s superiors was waiting. They asked for his security badge and told him that he was fired. Mr. LeDonne and a Wells lawyer marched him out the front door.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to die,\u201d Mr. Tran recalled. \u201cFrom the time they walk me out that door, I don\u2019t have any backup.\u201d\n\nOn the street, they told him that if he had any questions about why he was fired, he could call a number they gave him for a human resources representative.\n\nHe called the number. An H.R. person told Mr. Tran that he had been fired for failing to orally respond to a customer whose call he had answered.\n\nMr. Tran was mortified. He couldn\u2019t sleep. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell his wife, Ann, and their sons, Justin and Jimmy, that he had been fired. When they asked why he wasn\u2019t going to work in the mornings, Mr. Tran said he was on vacation. When that excuse no longer seemed plausible, he invented another.\n\n\u201cI thought, my God, I\u2019ve lost my American dream,\u201d he said.\n\nHis wife worked in a dental equipment factory. She earned $17 per hour, and it was suddenly the family\u2019s only income.\n\nGnawing Anger\n\nAfter three months of unemployment, in February 2015 he landed a call center job at U.S. Bank, where he still works.\n\nEven with a new job, he remained angry about what he felt was his unfair firing. In June 2015, he sued Wells Fargo in federal court for retaliation and other claims. His lawyers argued that Wells had tried to silence him and, when that failed, fired him.\n\nWells Fargo tried, through standard court procedures including a motion to dismiss, to kill the lawsuit, to no avail.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tran wanted to go to trial. He and his lawyers never specified how much money they wanted a jury to award Mr. Tran in damages and compensation, but they said in a court filing that it should be no more than $179 billion \u2014 a figure they knew was unrealistic. What Mr. Tran really wanted, he said, was to force Wells to publicly admit wrongdoing.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s lawyers maintained that the bank had fired Mr. Tran for poor performance. They claimed Mr. Tran never reported anything to his superiors. Court filings indicate that they hoped to use inconsistencies in his deposition to prove he couldn\u2019t show when or how he had complained about the lost loan documents.\n\nA trial was scheduled for last month in federal court in Portland. After years of discovery, the trial promised to dredge up unflattering information about Wells Fargo. The timing was bad: The bank was in the final stages of negotiating a painful settlement with the Federal Reserve, which would bar Wells Fargo from growing until it fixed its problems. The bank was trying to position itself as having moved past its era of malfeasance.\n\nWith the trial three weeks away, Wells Fargo asked to engage in mediation, according to Mr. Tran\u2019s lawyer, Michael Fuller. Mr. Fuller told Mr. Tran that it was possible Wells Fargo would try to settle the case.\n\nMr. Fuller said in an interview in late January that he could not foresee Mr. Tran\u2019s settling for less than $10 million.\n\nMr. Tran did not want to settle. He wanted Wells Fargo to have to admit it was wrong.\n\n\u201cThey have so much money,\u201d he said in a Feb. 2 interview. \u201cThey use that money to buy off the American justice system, and they never go to court.\u201d\n\nHe said he was considering not showing up to the meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to go to court,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to settle.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Mr. Tran settled. He stopped returning phone calls seeking comment.\n\nPeople familiar with the settlement said it included a seven-figure payment to Mr. Tran.\n\nMr. Coles, the Wells Fargo customer who said the bank had spent three years trying to collect money he never borrowed, laughed when told of the settlement\u2019s size.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good for him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got anything to worry about now.\u201d\n\nMr. Coles is still battling the bank. \u201cI think we should be compensated for the trouble they\u2019ve caused us,\u201d he said.", "author": ["Emily Flitter"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/business/china-central-bank-guo-shuqing.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-25T15:21:56", "title": "China Splits Top Jobs at Central Bank, Adding Another Reformer", "text": "In that analogy, Mr. Guo will essentially become the chairman of China\u2019s central bank while Mr. Yi, as governor, will act like a chief executive.

The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to provide any immediate comment.\n\nMr. Yi gave a speech and took questions from the audience at the conference in the early afternoon but did not mention Mr. Guo. In his speech, Mr. Yi said that China would act resolutely against anyone who engaged in illegal financial activities without a license \u2014 a reference to a continuing campaign against so-called shadow banking.\n\nChina said last November that it would open its financial sector to greater international competition, in an unsuccessful move to tamp down President Trump\u2019s demands for a narrowing of the United States trade deficit with China.

Chinese officials have publicly acknowledged that they need to address rising leverage but contend that the country\u2019s minimal foreign debt, strong economic growth and increasingly stringent financial regulation mean that they have ample time to defuse the problem without a sharp slowdown in economic growth.\n\nMr. Guo has previously served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and as the governor of Shandong Province \u2014 two posts that gave him considerable clout and status in the Communist Party, which oversees all agencies of the government.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Yi is a former economics professor in Indiana who then taught in Beijing and spent the past two decades working his way up the ranks of the civil service at the central bank.\n\nAngel Gurr\u00eda, the secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said that the clear trend in recent weeks in China had been for the top jobs to be filled by technocrats with extensive financial expertise and with strong political credentials. He also cited Liu Kun, a longtime budget expert who became China\u2019s finance minister last Monday.\n\n\u201cThe trend is very clear \u2014 you strengthen the political level with people who are very knowledgeable in their expertise,\u201d Mr. Gurr\u00eda said.\n\nOther experts in Chinese policymaking said that the real contrast right now was between Liu He and his predecessor as vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Ma Kai. Mr. Ma was an influential advocate of the country\u2019s state-owned enterprises and was wary of policy changes that might result in bankruptcies at these enterprises leading to job losses.\n\nThat concern for state-owned enterprises appears to have faded as debt has become a bigger worry. But while Mr. Xi, the president, and Premier Li Keqiang and other leaders have all talked lately about addressing debt, the question remains whether they will keep tightening the brakes on China\u2019s credit system if the economy slows noticeably this year.\n\nOne of the dilemmas for China\u2019s leaders in choosing a successor for Mr. Zhou at the central bank was that whoever holds the title of governor is expected these days to travel extensively to meetings with other central bank governors to coordinate policy. That makes the governor somewhat less able to participate in the continuous debate in Beijing over exactly which domestic financial policies to adopt.\n\nMr. Yi speaks excellent English and will now play the role of China\u2019s monetary policy statesman to the world.

Nonetheless, progressive groups were sharply critical of Mr. Williams\u2019s reported candidacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity,\u201d said Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which advocates policies that promote full employment. \u201cThis process began with a lot of talk from the Federal Reserve about diversity \u2014 diversity of background and diversity of experience.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams\u2019s regulatory record will be important, given the New York Fed\u2019s role in Wall Street oversight. One of the major banks in Mr. Williams\u2019s backyard, Wells Fargo, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in millions of accounts being opened without customers\u2019 knowledge. The San Francisco Fed has recently pushed for major structural changes to Wells Fargo, and the Fed last month announced tough penalties on the company.\n\nOn monetary policy, Mr. Williams has been an influential voice at the Fed, where he has recently pushed for the central bank to rethink its 2 percent inflation target and to consider a new system in which policymakers would sometimes allow prices to rise more quickly to make up for periods when inflation was lower. Had such a policy been in place during the most recent recession, the Fed might have been even more aggressive in its efforts to stimulate the economy.\n\nBut at the Fed\u2019s meeting last week, Mr. Williams voted along with his colleagues to hike interest rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis, and he has generally supported the Fed\u2019s current policy of gradually raising rates to keep a lid on inflation. He has repeatedly said that the United States is at \u201cfull employment,\u201d meaning that joblessness is as low as it can get without triggering inflation over the long term.

Even some supporters of the tariffs say it is unclear from the outside how Mr. Trump plans to leverage them to bring about a broader global offensive against the overproduction of the metals by countries such as China.\n\nOther supporters remain optimistic that Mr. Trump will succeed in using the threat of tariffs to win concessions from trading partners that benefit America.\n\nMr. Trump has long argued that China is cheating under the global rules of trade and has vowed to reduce the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China and other countries. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with cheap steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country. That argument is what motivated Mr. Trump\u2019s initial declaration last month that he would impose what is effectively a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum from every country in the world.\n\nHe has since backtracked, in a series of decisions that have stirred chaos in Washington and abroad. On Thursday, the United States temporarily exempted the European Union, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs. And the White House raised the specter of another showdown, saying that the tariffs would be lifted only until May 1, pending negotiations, and that it could impose quotas on metal imports from those countries at any point.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInside and outside Congress, trade experts have found themselves guessing at what is coming next on trade, and whether Mr. Trump has a broader strategy.\n\nA theory in trade policy circles is that Mr. Trump may have announced the tariffs \u2014 and set the window for negotiating with allies who are initially exempted \u2014 to pressure those allies to impose their own tariffs on steel and aluminum on countries like China and South Korea. Those countries have been identified by the Commerce Department as the worst offenders in global overproduction of those metals.\n\n\u201cClearly, those are the countries that are the source of most excess capacity,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cSo the best thing to do would be to find a way to circle the wagons, and wall off the rest of the world from those bad actors.\u201d\n\nIf that is the administration\u2019s goal, it has chosen a curious route to it. For one, it has thus far denied an exemption to Japan, a prominent ally and now America\u2019s largest source of steel that still faces the tariffs. And it temporarily exempted South Korea, which most trade hawks consider a major source of the steel overcapacity problem.\n\nThe Korean inclusion points to a second possible strategy, one that is less about walling off excess steel in China and more about using the metals tariffs as a weapon to win trade concessions from individual partners. Mr. Ross seemed to offer some clues on Friday that this was the strategy, when he said a new trade agreement with South Korea would address the tariffs \u2014 known in trade jargon as Section 232 \u2014 and other issues.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are relatively close to a pretty comprehensive resolution with the South Korean government,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIt will encompass, if it goes through, both the 232s and broader trade issues.

Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.\n\nEarly on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.\n\nA larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document.\n\nAround October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.\n\nWaymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.\n\nBut Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.\n\nMr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.\n\nWhen Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.\n\nUber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.\n\nWaymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.\n\nNot all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents.

Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said.

Data from 1968 to 2017, supplied by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in its quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, shows that while professional forecasters as a group have had some ability to assess the probability that G.D.P. will decline in the next three months, they have exhibited no ability to do so a year in the future.\n\nIn fact, the latest survey gives a 17 percent probability that real G.D.P. will decline a year from now \u2014 which is the average probability for a decline in one year given in all of the surveys since 1970. In essence, these forecasters are saying that nothing special is on the horizon. The risk of a recession is perfectly average. That might be comforting if these predictions were accurate, but, sadly, they are not.\n\nThen there are the confidence indexes, which measure perceptions of business activity in the present and near future. There are strong readings in much of the world. But these findings are limited in their scope.\n\nThe Conference Board, for example, in its compilation of the Consumer Confidence Index in the United States, essentially asks respondents whether they think we are on the verge of a recession, or may even be in one. The index does not plumb the underlying attitudes that might be setting the stage either for a long and strong boom or a long and damaging depression, though it is a leading indicator of short-term shifts.\n\nAt the moment, Mr. Trump appears to be elevating the levels of the main confidence indexes.

Mr. Trump would, because their conclusions just don\u2019t sound right to him, even if he can\u2019t explain why. And the Trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success: a billionaire, a bon vivant and now president.\n\nIn the same book, Mr. Trump said his approach implied stress: \u201cI want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives.

The indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long-term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of high adventuresome spirit in business. Too high, actually.\n\nThis confidence crashed, shifting into the gloom of the Great Depression of the 1930s, a period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment. As the decade wore on, the term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d became prominent. That depression was \u201cgreat\u201d partly because it lasted more than 10 years. It wasn\u2019t the kind of greatness that Mr. Trump aspires to in his slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nA future downturn isn\u2019t a widespread top-of-mind concern, the confidence indexes show. Instead, we may surmise that at the moment, many people are emulating Mr. Trump and trying to think big. Even those who loathe him might be inspired by his personal success, though this isn\u2019t being measured by the confidence indexes.\n\nBut at some point, a significant recession will appear. We can only guess what might make it materialize.\n\nContagious words and stories, analogous to those using the #MeToo hashtag, could be enough to change the public mood about the Trump boom. Maybe a shift will come from the kind of stories that contributed to the dot-com collapse: tales of recently revered companies that turned out to have taken too many chances and so flamed out and crashed.\n\nA downturn could be set off by compromising stories about Mr. Trump himself, possibly those impugning his judgment in starting an international trade war.

What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then?\n\nThere were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done.\n\nWhen I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll be gone for three months, and you\u2019ll come back.\u201d He really just didn\u2019t even factor it into his decision making.\n\n\u201cNo more mousy voice.

No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else, and I can assure you your voice will be heard.\u201d\n\nNext time she had an opinion, she spoke up, and everyone was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really good idea.\u201d Then she was empowered to do it again and again.\n\nAnd still, some women may face discrimination. What then?\n\nIf you really don\u2019t feel you\u2019re getting the opportunities that you should be getting, maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then, of course, if you really feel like you\u2019re not being treated properly, as a person, there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern, to H.R., to legal.\n\nWhen you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group, you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O.

For added protection, she signed up for a service, EyeOn App, that signals three friends if she does not reply within a half-hour to scheduled alerts on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cOnce, I didn\u2019t respond, and everyone called me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.\u201d\n\nAlthough no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. \u201cI know people would have my back,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Peveler is among a growing number of older Americans who are unmarried and childless. By 2030, about 16 percent of women 80 to 84 will be childless, compared with about 12 percent in 2010, according to a 2013 report by AARP.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile Ms. Peveler is trying to control the risks of aging alone, many so-called elder orphans may not fare as well. Older single and childless people are at higher risk than those with children for facing medical problems, cognitive decline and premature death, according to a 2016 study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine at the Northwell Health system on Long Island. The study noted that about 22 percent of people 65 and older either are childless or have children who are not in contact.\n\nAdult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.\n\n\u201cPeople who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.\u201d Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank\u2019s trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank\u2019s decisions.\n\nChristina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a \u201cmicro board,\u201d which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. \u201cThe board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,\u201d Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.\n\nAs for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly \u201ccongregate living\u201d arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.\n\nWith no one to oversee their care, elder orphans who want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible could enlist a geriatric care manager, who monitors elderly clients and coordinates care.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.\n\n\u201cMore and more people were coming to us and saying, \u2018I\u2019m O.K. now, but I\u2019m realistic enough to know my health status could change,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.\n\nPhoto\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of volunteer neighborhood groups are providing both social connections and practical help to older people who are at home alone. More than 200 organizations in the Village to Village Network, including \u201cvillages\u201d in the New York area, provide rides to medical appointments, snow removal, home repairs and computer support. Villages in 150 additional neighborhoods are in development. Tax-deductible membership fees can range from $100 to $400.\n\nEntrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,\u201d said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.\n\nFor example, the ride-hailing service Lyft is working with health care systems and retirement communities to provide rides to nonemergency medical appointments and other destinations. And because financial acuity often declines with age, childless singles can enroll in a service such as EverSafe, which monitors accounts for unusual spending and alerts the client or a trusted advocate of possible fraud.\n\nIn-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.\n\n\u201cIf I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,\u201d said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa \u201cto make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.\u201d\n\nFor those aging solo, expanding a social network is essential, according to experts on aging. Two years ago, Carol Marak, who is in her mid-60s and lives alone in Dallas, started the Elder Orphan Facebook Group.\n\n\u201cI wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,\u201d said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.\n\nMs. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being \u201cisolated and disconnected from the community.\u201d She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.\n\nDetermined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. \u201cI need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,\u201d she said.", "author": ["Susan B.

Without serious competition, W.W.E. has built a business that allows its stars to reach levels of opulence never before associated with wrestling, both in income and crossover appeal. A top star like John Cena can appear with W.W.E. one night and guest-host NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show the next morning. There are, however, only so many Cena-level spots available.\n\nNew Japan\u2019s rise has come, in part, from offering its performers more artistic freedom as well as additional avenues for income that are not always available to those working for W.W.E.

There were like three people in the club, and I made enough money on two songs to make more than I did all week answering phones at the riding stable that I worked at.\u201d\n\nAfter high school, she found a professional home at the Gold Club in Baton Rouge, ingratiating herself with management as a reliable and magnetic performer, slogging through shifts from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. to earn perhaps a few hundred dollars a night.\n\nPhoto\n\nA calendar from 1999, in which Ms. Clifford straddles a Harley-Davidson as the dancer for July, still sits in the club, now called the Penthouse Club Baton Rouge.\n\n\u201cWe knew,\u201d said Chuck Rolling, who has long overseen operations there. \u201cShe was moving in a direction that was bigger than us. We\u2019re in Baton Rouge. We\u2019re not even New Orleans.\u201d\n\nMs. Clifford eventually graduated to higher-profile dancing work, traveling across Texas and Louisiana to headline at strip clubs, before transitioning to pornography. She was both determined to bend the business to her will and conflicted about the long-term consequences. \u201cI have very mixed emotions about stripping because stripping got me where I am now,\u201d she said, at age 23, in an industry interview. \u201cI own my own house, I own my own car, I own my own business. My credit is excellent. I have nice furniture and nice things.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

She was not an Angel, or a Summer, or a Destiny. She was Stormy. And she was blond now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOften, she kept to herself. Mike South, a director and columnist in the industry press, recalled encountering her in 2004, the year she was named \u201cbest new starlet\u201d at the Adult Video News Awards, pornography\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars. \u201cShe was sitting in the lobby, alone, and I just decided to be friendly,\u201d said Mr. South, who invited her to a group dinner. \u201cShe looks at me and doesn\u2019t crack a smile \u2014 expressionless \u2014 and says, \u2018I am really not that friendly.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRecognition came quickly anyway: awards, magazine spreads, feature roles and a contract with Wicked Pictures, a prominent pornography company. When she needed to, she charmed industry gatekeepers with a disarming wit.\n\n\u201cAre those real?\u201d read a question posted on her website.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re certainly not imagining them.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, as Jenna Jameson, then the industry\u2019s reigning monarch, announced her retirement at an awards show \u2014 \u201cI will never spread my legs in this industry again,\u201d she told the crowd \u2014 Ms. Clifford seemed to position herself next in line.\n\n\u201cI love you, Jenna,\u201d Ms. Clifford said, accepting an award from Ms. Jameson moments later, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to spread my legs a little longer.\u201d\n\nOther Horizons\n\nIt was a striking political slogan: \u201cScrewing People Honestly.\u201d But subtlety was never the idea.\n\nIn 2009, well into her turn as a director, Ms. Clifford sensed an opening beyond her typical orbit. David Vitter, a United States senator in her home state of Louisiana, was staggering toward a re-election year, laid low by a prostitution scandal. Ms. Clifford declared herself a Republican (though a Democratic operative was said to be involved in her efforts) and courted wide-scale media attention as she publicly weighed the merits of running. In remarks at the time, she connected her professional journey to the lives of service workers across the state.\n\n\u201cJust as these misguided arbiters of the mainstream view an adult entertainment star as an anathema to the political process,\u201d she said, when she eventually decided against a bid, \u201cso too do they view the dishwasher, the cashier or the bus driver.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe false-start campaign coincided with a turbulent moment in her personal life, exposing her to scrutiny in the mainstream press. In July 2009, Ms. Clifford was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence after hitting her husband, a performer in the industry, and throwing a potted plant during a fight about laundry and unpaid bills, according to police records. The husband, Michael Mosny, was not injured, and the charge was later dropped. Ms. Clifford had previously been married to another pornographic actor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe has since married another colleague in the business, Brendon Miller, the father of her now 7-year-old daughter. He is also a drummer and has composed music for her films. The family has been spotted often at equestrian events, where Ms. Clifford, the owner of several horses, has captured blue ribbons. Her preparations can be meticulous, matching her saddle pad with a horse\u2019s bonnet colors.\n\n\u201cShe takes it very personally that she does well,\u201d said Dominic Schramm, a horse trainer and rider who has worked with her for several years. \u201cShe can be quite hard on herself.\u201d\n\nMs. Clifford has not shown up at competitions since news broke in January that she accepted a financial settlement in October 2016 \u2014 weeks before the election \u2014 agreeing to keep quiet about her alleged intimate relationship with Mr. Trump. She has said the affair, which representatives of Mr. Trump have denied, began in 2006 and extended into 2007, the year she married Mr. Mosny.\n\nEarlier this month, she escalated public attention by filing suit, calling the 2016 contract meaningless given that Mr. Trump had never signed it and revealing that the president\u2019s personal lawyer had taken further secret legal action to keep her silent this year.\n\nShe has said that she does not want to expose the equestrian world \u2014 or her daughter \u2014 to the attendant circus trailing her now.\n\nBut the show has gone on for Ms. Clifford. She has danced across the country in recent months, from Las Vegas to Long Island. There are many more appearances to come. It would be foolish, she has said, to turn down more money than usual for the same work.\n\n\u201cShe likes to maximize her profits,\u201d said Danny Capozzi, an agent who manages her bookings, \u201cnot only on the feature dance bookings but at all times.\u201d", "author": ["Matt Flegenheimer", "Rebecca R.

After Mr. Diller mocked Trump\u2019s campaign in 2015, Trump tweeted: \u201cLittle Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me. He is a sad and pathetic figure. Lives lie!\u201d\n\nMr. Diller waves off talk of Mr. Trump opening the door to more celebrity presidents, saying, \u201cI want this to be a moment in time where you go in and pick out this period with pincers and go on with life as we knew it before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHas the media gone overboard in criticizing Mr. Trump?\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d he replies.\n\nMr. Diller says that he and his wife, Diane von Furstenberg, are friends with Josh Kushner and his supermodel girlfriend, Karlie Kloss, but do not hang out with Jared and Ivanka.\n\nHe has put Chelsea Clinton on the boards of two of his companies, but that is not likely to happen with this first daughter.\n\n\u201cI mean, we were friendly,\u201d he says of Ivanka, in the time before Mr. Trump became president. \u201cI would sit next to her every once in a while at a dinner.

He has three Jack Russell terriers cloned from his late, beloved dog Shannon, a Gaelic orphan he found wandering many years ago on a back road in Ireland.\n\nFor about $100,000, a South Korean firm \u201creincarnated\u201d Shannon in three pups: Tess, short for \u201ctest tube,\u201d and DiNA, a play on DNA, who live in Beverly Hills; and Evita, who lives in Cloudwalk, the Connecticut home of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg.\n\n\u201cThese dogs, they\u2019re the soul of Shannon,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane was horrified that I was doing this but she\u2019s switched now to say, \u2018Thank God you did.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Diller has started a trend in Hollywood, inspiring his friend Barbra Streisand, desolate over the loss of her Coton de Tulear, Samantha, to clone her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDoesn\u2019t he want to clone himself into a \u201cKiller Diller,\u201d as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Eisner and Uber\u2019s Dara Khosrowshahi, are known?\n\n\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he says with a grimace.\n\nFrom Mailroom to #MeToo Maelstrom\n\nI ask Mr. Diller what he thought of Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s joke at David Geffen\u2019s recent birthday party at Jimmy Iovine\u2019s house in Los Angeles that Mr. Geffen, Mr. Diller and the other starry billionaires and millionaires there represented \u201cthe world\u2019s third-largest economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a funny joke,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s close to true.\u201d\n\nIs it a cool club to be in, I wonder, or a back-stabbing one?\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s stimulating,\u201d he says. \u201cDiane hates it.

Would it be made today in the same way? Probably so. So I don\u2019t think it affects content.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI mean, if you take the effect of pornography on young people today. Pornography until recently was fairly staid. Today, online, pornography is so extreme and so varied, with such expressions of fetishism and other things that boys are seeing. The idea of normal sex and normal romance has to be adversely affected by that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOnce, Hollywood taught us about desire and sex and romance, giving us a vocabulary for these experiences. But no more. I wonder what will happen as girls emboldened by the fall of male predators collide with boys indoctrinated by pornography.\n\n\u201cI see it in our companies, where the relationships between people are changing,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cWe recently had a formal complaint made by a woman who said that she was at a convention with her colleagues and she was asked to have a drink with her boss. Period. That was the complaint. And we said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing. Anybody can ask you anything, other than let\u2019s presume something illegal, and you have the right to say \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d If it\u2019s \u201cYes,\u201d go in good health and if it\u2019s \u201cNo,\u201d then it\u2019s full stop.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut the end result of that is a guy, let\u2019s presume he is heterosexual, and his boss, heterosexual, and guy asks guy for a drink and they go have a drink and they talk about career opportunities. And the boss says, \u2018Oh, this is a smart guy. I\u2019m promoting him.\u2019 A woman now cannot be in that position. So all these things are a-changin\u2019.\n\n\u201cGod knows, I\u2019m hardly a sociologist. But I hope in the future for some form of reconciliation. Because I think all men are guilty. I\u2019m not talking about rape and pillage. I\u2019m not talking about Harveyesque. I\u2019m talking about all of the spectrum. From an aggressive flirt. Or even just a flirty-flirt that has one sour note in it. Or what I think every man was guilty of, some form of omission in attitude, in his views. Are we really going to have only capital punishment? Because right now, that\u2019s what we have. You get accused, you\u2019re obliterated. Charlie Rose ceases to exist.\u201d\n\nTwilight of the Gods\n\nMr. Diller is the chairman of the board of Expedia, and his IAC owns a gaggle of internet properties, including Vimeo, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Tinder, Match and OkCupid. I wonder how he thinks online dating is reshaping the culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like the princess phone evolved to the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cMatch.com has caused God knows how many more marriages than bars ever did. And now I\u2019m starting to hear that out of Tinder. It\u2019s funny, though, on Bumble, the women get to choose first and they don\u2019t want to. I liked the sheer adventure of romance before online dating, which is less appealing to me.\u201d\n\nI ask Mr. Diller, a Los Angeles native, about a comment made to me by the playwright and TV writer Jon Robin Baitz, another Los Angeles native, that Hollywood is no longer relevant politically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDoes Hollywood reflect in any possible sense what is happening in the world?\u201d Mr. Baitz asked. \u201cHollywood abdicated films and became an empty exercise in male capes and superheroes. Can you imagine anyone now making \u2018Norma Rae,\u2019 \u2018Silkwood,\u2019 \u2018Five Easy Pieces,\u2019 \u2018Reds\u2019?\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Diller was running Paramount in 1981 when Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton made Mr. Beatty\u2019s epic \u201cReds,\u201d he should know.\n\n\u201cWhat an undertaking,\u201d Mr. Diller says. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it amazing how it holds?\u201d\n\nCalling \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d \u201cawful\u201d and \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d \u201cbeautiful but silly,\u201d he says he wouldn\u2019t want to run a movie studio now. \u201cIt would be like saying, do I want to own a horse-and-buggy company? The idea of a movie is losing its meaning.\u201d\n\nOf the Academy Awards nominees this year, he said, \u201cessentially, no one went to see them.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Beverly Hills with a father in the construction business \u2014 he says there are still streets out here named \u201cDillerdale\u201d and \u201cBarrydale\u201d \u2014 Mr. Diller was able to see the twilight of the men who invented Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThey were real characters \u2014 overblown, exuberant, nasty, but each of them in their own way were genuinely interesting people,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that I\u2019ve learned, that I think I\u2019ve had some instinct for, is instinct. And these people operated completely out of instinct. As against today, when people operate out of research and marketing.\u201d\n\nHe says that Netflix and Amazon have blasted Hollywood into \u201ca completely different universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s never happened in media before, when Netflix got a lot of subscribers early on and made the brilliant decision to pour it into original production, like spending more than $100 million dollars to make \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 instead of buying old stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt blows my mind. It\u2019s like a giant vacuum cleaner came and pushed all the other vacuum cleaners aside. And they cannot be outbid. No one can compete with them.\u201d\n\nHe calls Reed Hastings, the C.E.O. of Netflix, the most remarkable person in the media business: \u201cHe has so much original thinking in so many different areas, he\u2019s really impressive.\u201d\n\nI ask how the tech community\u2019s noxious bro culture will affect the business here, given that Hollywood already has such entrenched sexism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tech people,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of romance in them. They don\u2019t have a lot of nuance in them. Their lives are ones and zeros.\u201d But they can grow, he says. \u201cWhen I met Bill Gates, I would say he had the emotional quotient of a snail. And now you can see him cry.\u201d\n\nHe corrects me when I call the tech titans our overlords. \u201cOur overlords are not them,\u201d he says. \u201cOur overlords are artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nAt several points during our three-hour interview, Mr. Diller stops to ask me if this is any fun. When I assure him it\u2019s fascinating, he looks skeptical.\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t seduce me. I\u2019m a very seducible person.\u201d He also says he\u2019s a \u201cjinxable\u201d person.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He\u2019s not a pig. I mean, in no way.\u201d\n\nHe impressed her immediately on a trip to Vegas by driving his banana yellow Jaguar E-Type sports car barefoot and talking a policeman out of giving him a speeding ticket.\n\nOn another occasion, driving back into Manhattan fast from her Connecticut house \u2014 Mr. Diller likes to drive fast \u2014 they saw an octogenarian couple crossing the street slowly, holding on to each other.\n\n\u201cBoth of us at the same time thought exactly the same thing: \u2018One day, we will be that couple,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe only thing we disagree on is, he thinks it was Madison Avenue and I say it was Lexington.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe other quality his friends talk about is his voracious curiosity.\n\n\u201cWhen he knows about something, he knows more about it than anyone else, and when he doesn\u2019t know something, he wants to know more about it than anybody else,\u201d says Scott Rudin, who has produced movies, plays and television with Mr. Diller (including \u201cLady Bird\u201d for the screen and \u201cBetrayal,\u201d \u201cThe Humans,\u201d \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d for Broadway). Mr. Rudin is also helping his friend develop the so-called Diller Island, an undulating pier floating on piles in the Hudson River adjacent to the meatpacking district.\n\nGiven that Mr. Diller helped create the Fox Broadcasting Company with Rupert Murdoch \u2014 and blessedly greenlighted \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d \u2014 I wonder if he feels like Dr. Frankenstein.\n\n\u201cI left Fox before Fox News came into being,\u201d he says. About the sale of Fox to Disney, he notes that his former boss \u201cplayed a bad hand very well.\u201d\n\nI observe that he called Harvey Weinstein out publicly as a bully early on.\n\nMr. Diller recalls that once in Cannes, when he was the chief executive of Universal, Stacey Snider, the head of the movie division, told him that \u201cHarvey had treated her terribly and made her cry. So the next day I saw Harvey on the terrace at Hotel du Cap and I said, \u2018Harvey, don\u2019t ever treat an executive at my company that way. Don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone in that manner.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd Harvey, about six feet away, said, \u2018I\u2019m going to throw you off the terrace.\u2019 And this gorilla, because he looks like a gorilla, starts walking towards me, right? And truly, I was scared. I thought, how, without cutting and running like a chicken, do I stop him?

After leaving NBC for the first time, he opened an advertising, marketing and communications firm. PBS, one of his clients, hired him as its president in 1976.\n\nIn 1980, he refused to bow to pressure that PBS not show \u201cDeath of a Princess,\u201d a film based on a true story about a Saudi princess who had been publicly beheaded for adultery a few years earlier.

At least 38 states have passed local versions of right-to-try laws, which allow patients to sidestep F.D.A. approval once they have received permission from a company.\n\nThe right-to-try measures are opposed by a broad coalition of groups, which contend the bill will not help patients and will undermine the authority of the primary regulatory agency, the F.D.A. Four former F.D.A. commissioners, including two each from Democratic and Republican administrations, oppose the bills, as do dozens of patient groups, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Lung Association.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry, while not taking a position on the issue, has been circumspect.

The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with undervalued steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country.\n\nThat\u2019s why the administration initially announced that its steel and aluminum tariffs would apply worldwide. While the tariffs are explicitly based on national security \u2014 the White House argues that the nation is vulnerable because it relies too much on foreign steel and aluminum \u2014 there are obvious economic reasons for trying to increase domestic production.\n\nBut the 25 percent charge on foreign steel and 10 percent levy on aluminum will, at least for now, not apply to a broad group of allies that includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and the European Union. The excluded nations sent more than half of the $29 billion in steel imports that landed on American shores last year.

The short answer is that no one \u2014 not the lawyers representing allies, the lobbyists representing steel mills or the nation\u2019s foremost experts on trade \u2014 knows for sure what the president\u2019s grand plan is.\n\nA good bet, trade experts say, is that Mr. Trump is using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to corral allies into adopting a harder line on China.\n\nThe White House also invited other countries to negotiate their own exemptions, raising the possibility that Japan, the fifth-largest supplier of steel to American companies, could also get a break.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Several steel companies are now trading lower than they were before Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, after getting an initial lift from the news.\n\nWhat\u2019s the impact on American manufacturers?\n\nMaking metals more expensive will annoy a lot of manufacturers \u2014 tens of thousands \u2014 that buy them to produce everything from washing machines to beer cans. But will the tariffs make it impossible for those companies to do business?\n\nAnswering that question will be the task of the Commerce Department, which this week invited American executives to begin applying for exemptions. To avoid paying the tariffs on the steel or aluminum they import, businesses will need to show that American mills don\u2019t make the piece they use, or at least don\u2019t make enough.\n\nRailroads make some of their tracks with Japanese steel, for example, because of its unique ability to withstand pressure and extreme temperatures.\n\nCompanies have to file separate requests for each type of steel or aluminum product they use. In theory, dozens of companies could ask about the same product and one company could file requests for dozens of slightly different products.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department could \u201cgrant blanket requests\u201d if it became clear that a particular product couldn\u2019t be found in the United States.\n\nAmerican producers, meanwhile, will have the right to file an objection to each exclusion plea, piling on yet more paperwork.\n\nThe Commerce Department anticipates 4,500 requests and 1,500 challenges.

It funds virtually all of the nation\u2019s subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net \u2014 especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nThe program has been increasingly important in the aftermath of the Great Recession. As home building declined sharply and millennials entered the work force, the number of renters surged by about one million a year \u2014 the largest increase since the baby-boom generation came of age in the 1970s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.\n\nRents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The credits are then transferred to corporations \u2014 usually banks \u2014 in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.\n\nThe tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren\u2019t as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco, the tax law will reduce the growth of subsidized affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next decade, compounding an existing shortage.\n\nMs. Cantwell\u2019s provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.\n\nStill, even if the increase in tax credits was made permanent, only about 30 percent of the decline in affordable housing due to last year\u2019s tax cuts would be restored, according to Novogradac\u2019s analysis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, the firm\u2019s managing partner. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a large shortage of units that aren\u2019t going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.\u201d", "author": ["Conor Dougherty"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/elon-musk-deletefacebook.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T19:00:51", "title": "Elon Musk Joins #DeleteFacebook With a Barrage of Tweets", "text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s Facebook?\u201d Mr. Musk replied to Mr. Acton.

Those funds were then invested into a variety of young companies in the hope of finding the next Facebook or Google among a sea of flops.\n\nThe influx of cash fueled the tech economy. Between 2006 and 2016, the last year with available data, economic output in the metropolitan area that roughly corresponds to Silicon Valley rose more than 5 percent a year, while the average growth rate in American metro areas was 1.2 percent.\n\nAnd venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups \u2014 \u201cunicorns,\u201d in Silicon Valley parlance \u2014 were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising.

His eldest son, Wayne Jr., recalled that as a child he spent summers working in landfills for his father.\n\n\u201cIt was a smell I grew to love,\u201d the younger Mr. Huizenga said in an interview on Friday. \u201cMy dad would say, \u2018It smells like money to me, son.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe company was worth several billion by the time Mr. Huizenga stepped back from his active role in 1984.\n\nWhile it was his partner, Dean Buntrock, who is credited with the vision for a waste company with a national footprint, Mr. Huizenga was quick to internalize the lessons of that success. He saw great opportunity in businesses, like garbage hauling, that had regular customers and recurring revenue but were fragmented and undercapitalized, suggesting that consolidation could yield great returns.\n\nDespite rarely watching movies himself, he recognized such an opportunity when he visited an obscure Chicago video store called Blockbuster in 1987. Traditional video stores were shoestring operations with minuscule offerings and a whiff of seediness. But Blockbuster was clean and inviting, and the selections seemed limitless.\n\nHe bought into the chain in 1987, when it claimed fewer than 20 stores, and helped expand it to more than 3,500 locations within seven years.\n\nWayne Huizenga Jr., who opened some of the first stores the company set up after the investment, recalled that his father had bought three centrally located liquor stores in South Florida and completely renovated them in the familiar Blockbuster image, with its bright lighting and large, open spaces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeeking to be family-friendly, the chain refused to stock films rated NC-17 (not to mention X). \u201cParents would thank you for not having a section their children can\u2019t go,\u201d Wayne Jr. said.\n\nAs Blockbuster\u2019s prominence \u2014 and stock price \u2014 rose, Mr. Huizenga became something of a folk hero in South Florida, where, it sometimes seemed, much of the community was sharing in his wealth. Strangers would approach him to ask about the business and reveal that they owned stock.\n\nWhen he decided to sell to Viacom for $8.4 billion in 1994, said Mr. Henninger, Mr. Huizenga still loved the business but felt he had no choice because of his obligation to shareholders.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, he had gained a legendary reputation among investors that sometimes outstripped his ability to deliver. The stock of companies he acquired or took public would balloon, largely on the basis of his involvement.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI often heard him say, \u2018That stock is running fast,\u2019 \u201d the younger Mr. Huizenga said. \u201cI think that put a lot of pressure on him.\u201d\n\nThe share price of one of those companies, Republic Services, appreciated many times over in the first few years after Mr. Huizenga assumed control in 1995. Though Republic at the time was another garbage-hauling company, it became a vehicle for the conglomerate that Mr. Huizenga had set out to build. It proceeded to open a national chain of used-car stores and purchase dozens of new-car dealerships as well as a few rental car companies for good measure, among them Alamo and National.\n\nMr. Huizenga believed that consolidation of these different entities would unlock significant efficiencies, and that the sheer volume made possible by a national automobile retail and service business could offset its low margins.\n\n\u201cWe were coming from Blockbuster, with huge gross margins, and he said, \u2018There\u2019s no margins here,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Henninger said. \u201cI started to agree with him.

In 1999, the company hired Mike Jackson, at the time the head of Mercedes-Benz in the United States, as its chief executive.\n\nAfter two weeks on the job, Mr. Jackson recalled in an interview, he met with Mr. Huizenga and told him that to rationalize the business, it should sell off many pieces and focus on new cars.\n\n\u201cIt was a moment of truth, telling Wayne we would have to do some major surgery,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cBut he said, \u2018O.K., Mike, you have my support.\u2019 Wayne fully empowered me to do what needed to be done.\u201d\n\nAutoNation today is the largest pure auto retailer in the country as well as one of the most consistently profitable players in the industry.\n\nMr. Huizenga retired as chairman of AutoNation in the early 2000s but remained a major shareholder and mentor to Mr. Jackson.\n\nAs a businessman, Mr. Huizenga was famous for his brass tacks financial sense, but this same unsentimentality led to a checkered career as a sports magnate, whose portfolio included the Florida Panthers hockey team and the Miami Dolphins. He owned a World Series champion, the 1997 Florida Marlins, but began dismantling the team shortly after that triumph amid significant financial losses. He sold the team the following year.\n\nFor years after that, Mr. Huizenga was stung by criticism that he had betrayed the community with his coldblooded stewardship of its championship team. In his view, it was just the opposite: He had invested tens of millions of dollars of personal money to produce a contender and succeeded against all odds, only to see the Florida fan-base respond indifferently.\n\n\u201cI think that had the stands been filled every day for regular games and not at one-quarter capacity, he would have said, \u2018I lost $30 million but South Florida is happy,\u2019 \u201d the younger Mr. Huizenga said. \u201cInstead, he lost $30 million and no one came.

If Mr. Hill held his 1916 Babe Ruth card in one hand and his 1952 Mickey Mantle in the other, he would have about $1.2 million pinched between his fingers.\n\nThose sky-high values mean that collecting cards is no longer child\u2019s play; it\u2019s a big-money realm of affluent collectors who have their eye on returns. And Mr. Hill is part of a growing group of collectors who see their cards as investments, even if the type of investment they are \u2014 artwork or security \u2014 is debatable.\n\nPWCC, an auction site for trading cards of all kinds, is set to introduce a series of indexes modeled on the S.&P. 500 to help collectors track the value of their cards and understand what their portfolio is worth.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company has three indexes of the top-trading high-value cards: the top 100, 500 and 2,500. The indexes are based on auction sales data from the past 10 years.\n\nThe top three are the 1952 Mantle, like Mr. Hill\u2019s; a 1954 Hank Aaron card; and a 1933 Babe Ruth card. Over the past decade, the Mantle card has appreciated 590 percent, the Aaron card 829 percent, and the Ruth card 305 percent.\n\n\u201cMost collectors feel they\u2019ve done well with their cards as investments,\u201d said Brent Huigens, chief executive of PWCC Auctions. \u201cBut there was no statistical analysis available. There was no data for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Huigens said card collecting was something of a hybrid of investing in stocks and fine art, and his indexes try to account for that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nostalgia in cards, which compares to the art markets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a stock market because of all the data we have.\u201d\n\nPWCC, which is one of 10 or so big card auction sites, helped collectors sell $50 million in cards last year.\n\nLike any investment, what goes up can go down, and investing in trading cards has its own risks. Mr. Huigens pointed out that many cards in the top 500 had fallen in value. There have also been several card bubbles over the past three decades.\n\nHe said a small group of collectors with about $20 million among them ran up prices in 2016, but the broader collecting market did not follow. \u201cThey put all their money into one card and not others,\u201d he said. \u201cThey created outliers they couldn\u2019t maintain. The market has had to reassess itself.\u201d\n\nThe other driving force in turning a card hobby into an investment opportunity has been the acceptance of a single recognized grading system for the condition of the cards. An independent company called Professional Sports Authenticator will rate any card and give a grade from 0 to 10, which assesses a card\u2019s condition and, in most cases, determines its price.\n\nThe rising interest in cards as investments, though, is not spread evenly through the collecting universe; it is strongest at the highest end. Mr. Huigens said the rate of appreciation \u2014 and high prices \u2014 slowed beyond the top 100 cards.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut like any investment, you need a strategy. Mr. Hill said he focused on cards where \u201csupply meets demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just buy rarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the only one, everyone is going to know what you paid for it. There is no chance for appreciation. You have to wait for someone to come to your door and wrestle it away from you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe PWCC indexes shy away from the rarest cards because, Mr. Huigens said, they do not trade often enough, and the indexes are a measure of cards that are liquid. One parameter he set was all the included cards must have been sold at least 10 times in the last 10 years, with at least two sales in the last two months.\n\nPWCC also uses the grade \u2014 not just on the player, the year and the maker \u2014 when picking cards for its indexes. The top card in the index is the 1952 Topps Mantle in Grade 8 condition, which is worth about $400,000. There are only 33 known examples of this card in the world, Mr. Huigens said.\n\n(There are more expensive examples of the 1952 Topps Mantle; a Grade 10 card is worth around $10 million \u2014 but there are only three of those in the world and they don\u2019t change hands often, so they are excluded from the index.)\n\nSitting atop the excluded list is a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, once owned by the hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky. (Mr. Gretzky\u2019s own 1979 playing card is ranked No. 44, at a price of $25,000, the second-highest-ranked hockey card, behind Gordie Howe\u2019s.)\n\nTo collectors, this Wagner card has a mystical aura. It has been in the collection of Ken Kendrick, managing general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, since 2007.

Yet he remains a collector\u2019s collector. In an interview, he said that in the 1990s, when he stepped back from running Datatel, the technology company he founded, his first priority was to complete the sets that he and his brother created when they were boys.\n\nHe needed 40 cards for the full 1952 set, he recalled, and he went to work.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, I began to learn about the high-value cards with great grades,\u201d said Mr. Kendrick, whose Diamondbacks will host the Colorado Rockies on opening day on Thursday.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe made it his focus to acquire the top 25 cards in the highest grades.\n\n\u201cThe cards that I own are more akin to works of art,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cThey\u2019re valued like rare paintings because they are so rare, and they do carry very high price tags if they\u2019re resold.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Huigens said that Mr. Kendrick\u2019s Wagner and Mantle cards were together worth more than $20 million.\n\nWould-be collectors need not lay down so much money to get started; the prices for high-quality cards can be as low as the hundreds or thousands of dollars. \u201cI have cards worth $600,000 or $700,000,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cBut I also have another 1,000 cards that don\u2019t add up to that price.\u201d\n\nHe said he constantly bought and sold cards, both to realize gains and to fill holes in his collection.\n\nBaseball dominates card collecting, but other sports have climbed high in the PWCC index ranking, usually with cards of the sports\u2019 best players. The highest-ranked nonbaseball card comes in at No. 15: a Grade 10 rookie card of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson from 1980. It is worth about $75,000.\n\nThe highest-ranked football card is a Joe Namath Topps card from 1965. It\u2019s No. 37 and worth $35,000 in a near-perfect grade of 8.\n\nYounger buyers are driving card collecting in a different direction.

Mr. Kendrick said he was working on improving the quality of the cards in his 1952 Topps set.\n\n\u201cI have a full set of cards from that year and extra cards, but they\u2019re not the most highly graded,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve moved up the rankings, and I\u2019m No. 2.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for No. 1? \u201cA lawyer in Alabama,\u201d Mr. Kendrick said. \u201cHe knows I\u2019m gaining on him.\u201d", "author": ["Paul Sullivan", "Wealth Matters"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/china-tariffs-response.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T18:57:00", "title": "Why China\u2019s Response to Trump\u2019s Tariffs Is So Muted", "text": "But the escalating tensions, and the prospect of further action by China, have nevertheless raised concerns.\n\n\u201cWe do seem to be entering a trade war,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cThe U.S. has unsheathed its sword after an extended period of saber rattling, and the Chinese are now unsheathing their weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this will not spiral into a very broad set of sanctions on both sides,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think, given Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts and his very keen desire to deliver a political win whatever the political fallout might be, I don\u2019t think it can be tamped down now.\u201d\n\nStock markets in Asia slid on news of the escalating trade confrontation. By the close of trade on Friday, benchmark stock indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai had fallen 2.5 percent and 3.4 percent respectively, tracking an overnight drop in Wall Street.\n\nThe American restrictions announced on Thursday would include tariffs of 25 percent on a list of specific goods, a proposal that is set to be made in the coming days, followed by a 30-day public consultation. During that time, the administration may hold more talks with the Chinese government, and lobbyists will wage an energetic fight to have their employers\u2019 products removed from the list.\n\nThe loss to China from the planned tariffs would amount to no more than 0.1 percent of its economic output, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. JPMorgan said the potentially affected exports from China would account for 2.2 percent of the country\u2019s total exports, which totaled about $2.3 trillion in 2017.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe upshot is that today\u2019s tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,\u201d Mr. Williams wrote in a note.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina would charge a 15 percent tariff on the American-produced products listed in Friday\u2019s announcement.\n\nAnother round of tariffs could be imposed on a second group of American-made goods after China evaluates the impact of the American trade measures against China. That group would be charged 25 percent tariffs. It said businesses and other parties had until March 31 to submit views about the retaliatory tariffs, meaning they could take effect only after that date.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In particular, it could add aircraft and soybeans \u2014 both enormous American industries for which China is a critical market \u2014 to its list of restricted items. The United States exports $12.4 billion worth of soybeans to China, and analysts say that Boeing, which competes against Airbus of Europe to sell jetliners to Chinese carriers, is another obvious target.\n\n\u201cChina does not want to fight a trade war but is absolutely not afraid of a trade war,\u201d a Commerce Ministry representative said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident and capable of meeting any challenge and hope that the United States will pause on the brink of a precipice, make careful decisions and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.\u201d\n\nFor now, the proposed Chinese penalties appear to be a carefully calibrated response to the American steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect on Friday. Beijing\u2019s restrictions would affect $2.97 billion worth of American steel, aluminum and pork. That is roughly equivalent to the $2.79 billion worth of steel and aluminum that China exported to the United States last year, according to Commerce Department data.\n\nThe goods that Beijing plans to penalize represents about 2 percent of the total size of American exports to China, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not devastating economically by any stretch, but it\u2019s certainly going to hurt those interests in the United States that are trying to export,\u201d Mr. Bown said. He pointed out that the retaliation by China sent \u201ca negative signal, that they are not seeking to de-escalate things.\u201d\n\nChina also picked its targets carefully by choosing goods that had political resonance, akin to what the European Union did this month by targeting bourbon, bluejeans and motorcycles, products made in states with Republican politicians or that supported Mr. Trump in his 2016 election victory. In China\u2019s case, pork comes from Nebraska and the Midwest, states that backed Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI would say that China\u2019s proposal is quite restrained,\u201d said Song Guoyou, deputy director of the American studies center at Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr. Song characterized China\u2019s response as \u201ccautious anger.\u201d\n\nThat may not last for long, as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing widens.\n\nIn February, China opened an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into sorghum imports from the United States, less than two weeks after the United States said it was imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines that were aimed at curbing cheap imports from China and South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChina is still being moderate and is appropriately counterattacking,\u201d said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, an agriculture consulting firm. \u201cBoth sides appear to be sounding each other out.\u201d", "author": ["Sui-Lee Wee", "Keith Bradsher"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/dusty-job-power-trowel.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T16:44:55", "title": "It\u2019s a Tough, Dusty Construction Job.

So they proposed what Mr. Fields called, \u201cthis weird creative partnership where we wanted to appropriate her real, beautiful art for our fictional character.\u201d Ms. Monks agreed.\n\nPhoto\n\nI first met Ms. Monks in the late fall, in the Williamsburg studio that is also her apartment. She was wearing her uniform: boots, jeans, dark top, so much liner it looked like her eyes had fallen down twin holes.\n\nBorn in New Jersey, she earned an M.F.A. from the New York Academy of Art. She is an admired painter who worked in a more or less realistic style until the 2012 death of her mother pushed her into a more abstract form that emphasized imperfection and chaos.\n\nIn her home, the open-plan living room had been completely given over to painting.

As she painted, she often played episodes of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m learning a little Russian,\u201d she said.\n\nShe could have tried it out an evening a few days later when she went to \u201cThe Americans\u201d soundstage to help a team of set decorators with Erica\u2019s bedroom. The room itself unsettled her. The hospital bed reminded her of her mother\u2019s final illness. \u201cThis is very evocative,\u201d she said, \u201cvery surreal.\u201d While hammers struck a syncopated beat, she spread some drawings on the bed and arranged paintings across three of the walls. \u201cThat one on the bottom is upside-down,\u201d she said gently to a crew member.\n\nFinally, the crew stood back to admire the work. \u201cI think we were able to get a good range,\u201d Ms. Monks said approvingly. \u201cThey\u2019re not all screaming faces.\u201d\n\nA few days after that, she was on the set again. The first two episodes were shooting, and Ms. Monks had been tapped to provide Erica\u2019s sketch of a sleeping Elizabeth. One producer had tried to stash her in an unused quadrant of the stage \u2014 the set of a safe house \u2014 but Ms. Monks felt lonely in there, so she arranged her materials near a bank of monitors. She was worried she wouldn\u2019t have enough time for a decent sketch. \u201cMy grad-school teachers will be so mad if she doesn\u2019t have feet!\u201d she said.\n\nStill, she knew she shouldn\u2019t make the drawing too perfect. She was drawing as Erica, after all. \u201cThere will have to be some jagged moments where she\u2019s seizing with pain,\u201d Ms. Monks reasoned. \u201cI imagine the charcoal would break.\u201d\n\nOnce she\u2019d taken a photo of a sleeping Ms. Russell, Ms. Monks went back to her table, covering the paper with charcoal, then using an eraser to pull out lines and shadows and shapes. \u201cBloody hell, that\u2019s fast,\u201d the director Chris Long said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Shor, dressed as the dying Erica, sat up in bed, brandishing the charcoal fiercely for the camera and trying to make use of what Ms. Monks had taught her during a recent lesson. \u201cIt changed how I look at art; it changed how I thought about myself drawing,\u201d she said. Ms. Monks is a good teacher. In the first episodes, it\u2019s Ms. Shor\u2019s hands you\u2019ll see moving over the paper, not Ms. Monks\u2019s, though both were shot.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sketches and the paintings are the most obvious evidence of Ms. Monks\u2019s collaboration with \u201cThe Americans,\u201d but her influence is felt throughout the season. She\u2019s had an impact on the design, arguing against some bold blue-and-gold wallpaper as an overly busy background for the paintings and substituting rubber bands for store-bought clasps on Erica\u2019s drawing board. She has given notes on the scripts, too, nixing a moment when Erica\u2019s husband covers up a sleeping Elizabeth while Erica is in mid-portrait. \u201cAlyssa said, \u2018He\u2019s been married to her all these years,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fields recalled. \u201c\u2019If there\u2019s one thing you know, it\u2019s don\u2019t screw with the model.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd while Ms. Monks hasn\u2019t altered elements like who lives, who dies or who wears which wig, she has indirectly suggested new scenes and stories. \u201cThese paintings started almost infiltrating the imaginations of the writers and also the characters, something started to grow,\u201d Mr. Weisberg said by telephone as the season finished shooting.\n\nDuring a chat in January at the Forum Gallery, the Upper East Side space that represents her work, Ms. Monks said she didn\u2019t know if the show would change her life or her sales. But it has given her renewed faith in her work. Before she\u2019d joined up with \u201cThe Americans,\u201d she\u2019d felt afraid of the direction she was taking \u2014 \u201cdarker, more abstract, more emotionally evocative, a little riskier.\u201d Her time on the show, she said, has \u201cgiven me permission to go deep into it and find that there\u2019s a lot of beauty there.\u201d\n\nI passed this tribute on to the showrunners. \u201cThat\u2019s just the sort of backhanded compliment that we here at \u2018The Americans\u2019 like to get,\u201d Mr. Fields said. \u201cHere was an artist who was wondering whether or not things were too dark.

That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOf course, Dropbox\u2019s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap\u2019s did after its I.P.O. last year.\n\nStill, Dropbox\u2019s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.\n\nHis measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s huge pop, Dropbox\u2019s stock has arguably \u201cpriced in\u201d the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria\u2019s forecasts, Dropbox\u2019s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.\n\nWhat is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook\u2019s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox\u2019s.

The S.&P. 500 index was down 5.95 percent this week, falling every day but one. And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout, with the S.&P. 500 skidding 2.52 percent on Thursday and 2.1 percent on Friday.\n\nWe know that Mr. Trump watches the stock market\u2019s response to his policies. He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Will this week\u2019s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China? Mr. Trump sounded unfazed on Friday. \u201cI think the stock market is going to be great,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump signs spending bill.\n\nThe president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nEarly in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress\u2019s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.\n\nFrom this morning:\n\nJulie Hirschfeld and Michael D. Shear of the NYT:\n\nBut the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.\n\n(The backstory to the bill: Here\u2019s how Congressional leaders settled lawmakers\u2019 objections.)\n\nMark Zuckerberg and the congressional hearing ahead\n\nAs Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg came under criticism for saying nothing. Finally, on Wednesday he released a statement and sat down for interviews. We asked Paul Pendergrass, a long time corporate communication professional and formerly DealBook\u2019s \u201cJack Flack\u201d columnist, to offer his insights into the situation:\n\nIn most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to\u2026\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Laurie Segall, before immediately qualifying that answer with, \u201cif it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to offer Facebook\u2019s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.\n\nThe goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.\n\nHe elaborated:\n\nThe question in Congressional testimony is, \u201cWhat is the goal?\u201d That\u2019s not a media opportunity. At least it\u2019s not supposed to be.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they\u2019re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.\n\nSo it\u2019s definitely a media opportunity\u2026 but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.\n\nIf Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask John Stumpf, the former C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and the bank\u2019s current chief executive, Tim Sloan, how much information they were asked to provide. He could ask the same of the C.E.O. of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes. For that matter, Mr. Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI work for a staffing agency that places workers in groups of varying size, to work on specific projects, often at large firms. Recently, a member of a crew I am part of has engaged in behavior that could easily be construed as sexual harassment. He has touched one person in the group inappropriately \u2014 running his finger down her neck, caressing her back, for example. He has also repeatedly asked co-workers for the phone numbers of women in our group. (In general, our crews are majority female.) He even asked a recent widow if he could move in with her. Some of us are concerned since all of this pretty much violates the client firm\u2019s sexual harassment policies. But I think there is a reluctance to report him because the job doesn\u2019t pay well, and he needs the money. Any ideas? EVANSTON, ILL.\n\nAs described, your colleague\u2019s behavior is a serious issue. The fact that he \u201cneeds the money\u201d is not a valid excuse. Nor is it a good reason to let this slide.\n\nYou should definitely take some sort of action, but the details might depend on a couple of factors. For general legal context, I checked with Amy Epstein Gluck, an employment lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office of the firm FisherBroyles. Given the variety and frequency of this worker\u2019s apparent behavior, she said, the behavior should probably be reported to management at the agency that you and your fellow contractors work for.\n\n\u201cThe agency should investigate,\u201d Ms. Epstein Gluck said, and it should promptly talk to this employee and other relevant parties, handling the issue as appropriate. The specifics will depend on your agency\u2019s policies, but the bottom line is that managers there should want to know this is happening \u2014 to make it stop.\n\nSpeaking broadly, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers at companies with 15 or more employees from sexual harassment that creates a hostile work environment. If this worker ends up harassing employees of the client firm for which your group is working, those workers could have a Title VII claim against your agency (as well as their employer). Doing nothing is, in short, \u201crisking a real problem\u201d for the agency, Ms. Epstein Gluck says.", "author": ["Rob Walker"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/trade-tariffs-markets-stocks-bonds.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T23:29:14", "title": "Wall St. Closes Lower, as a U.S.-China Trade War Looms", "text": "\u201cInvestors are rattled about the economic and inflation impacts of tariffs and a potential trade war,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201cThis nine-year bull market has been sustained by a growing economy in a low inflation, low interest rate world.

Canyon Gate was still in ruins, its streets strewn with moldy furniture, the stench of rot everywhere.

We Can Help.\u201d\n\nBernadette Leaney, 67, one of the thousands of Houston residents whose homes were swamped in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, hated them. She and her neighbors were just beginning their grim reckoning with the damage. Who could be looking to make a buck this soon?

His name was Nick Pelletiere, she learned. He ran a company that transported cadavers for funeral homes, but recently he had expanded into another lightly regulated trade: buying and selling flooded homes. People in Canyon Gate called him Shady Nick.\n\nMr. Pelletiere is one of the many speculators driving a new \u2014 and somewhat confounding \u2014 economy in neighborhoods across post-Harvey Houston, one that is especially notable in Canyon Gate, a subdivision built in the 1990s where rice fields once stretched to the horizon. Many parts of the city were hit hard by the hurricane, but Canyon Gate has the extraordinary distinction of being built within the confines of a reservoir specifically designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to protect central Houston from calamitous flooding. Nearly every one of the 721 homes there is destined to flood again, yet the local trade in storm-damaged real estate is flourishing.\n\nCanyon Gate\u2019s dilemma lays bare a defining feature of coastal life in a time of climate change: Many of the neighborhoods where we already live should never have been built in the first place, and doubling down on reconstruction could make the consequences of the next disaster much more severe.

The United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, said he planned to file a new case at the W.T.O. to try to halt Beijing\u2019s policy of forcing foreign investors to transfer technology to China.\n\nThe administration\u2019s China offensive followed its decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. On Thursday, the administration significantly diminished the reach of those tariffs, exempting many of its allies \u2014 not least, the European Union.\n\nBut diplomats in Geneva said the damage to the global trading system went beyond the impact on metals, dealing a blow to the foundations of the W.T.O.\n\nThe Trump administration has justified its steel and aluminum tariffs by claiming that American national security is imperiled by a dependence on imported metals. Trade experts have heaped scorn on that claim, noting that the United States already produces more than two-thirds of the steel it uses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s invocation of national security broke with a deep-seated collective understanding that such claims are verboten as justification for tariffs. Once one country makes such a claim, the argument goes, others feel irresistible pressure to manufacture national security worries to protect their own industries.\n\nTrade disputes at the W.T.O. involving Russia and Ukraine will almost certainly feature the invocation of national security concerns to justify impediments to trade. The same goes for cases involving the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Azev\u00eado said. \u201cBut I still believe this is not the best way to go.\u201d\n\nQuiet and orderly, Geneva is generally not a place of drama. But recent weeks have generated anxiety and fear among the bureaucrats and diplomats who make up the trade organization.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They cited the fact that the steel and aluminum tariffs initially were to apply to every steel producer on earth and now apply to only a handful of countries, including China.\n\nDiplomats and trade organization officials acknowledge that the aggressive posture of the United States is in part an outgrowth of a substantial failure by the W.T.O. to update its rules to contend with China\u2019s rise.\n\nBack in 2001, when China gained admission to the trade organization, it was supposed to be the beginning of a transformative opportunity for the world. China would gain access to global markets for its wares, while the rest of the planet would gain entry to China. Some argued that China\u2019s integration into the world economy would encourage its leaders to further embrace market forces and eventually democracy.\n\nIn the years since, China has absorbed staggering amounts of foreign investment \u2014 much of it from the United States \u2014 erecting factories that have churned out products shipped to ports around the world. But persistent impediments have limited the chances for foreign investors to cash in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina has forced foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese counterparts while transferring technology to China. Chinese state-owned companies have remained a central force in the Chinese economy, securing sweetheart credit arrangements from government-owned banks, cut-rate energy supplies and other subsidies.\n\nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has used its growing commercial might to redouble the power of the state, cracking down on dissent.\n\nOfficials and diplomats now concede that the notion that inclusion in the global trading body would encourage China to embrace liberal values is a failure.\n\nBut the consequences of that failure are sowing worries that the future of the rules-based trading system is on the line.\n\nThe W.T.O. is the direct descendant of a global trading pact reached at the end of World War II, fueled by the idea that trade across borders minimizes prospects for war.\n\n\u201cIf the member countries simply begin to take matters into their own hands, disregarding all these principles, all these concepts, we may be in a situation where the global economic environment could deteriorate very fast,\u201d Mr. Azev\u00eado said. \u201cThese measures tend to exacerbate nationalistic sentiments. They tend to exacerbate intolerance.\u201d\n\nHe fretted that the United States continued to block the appointment of new judges to a W.T.O. appellate body that renders judgment on trade disputes between countries.\n\nThe United States has long complained that the process is slow and unfair, relying on archaic rules about fair pricing in the global economy. But Mr. Azev\u00eado said the Trump administration had offered no proposals for how to improve the process, while simply refusing to replace judges whose terms expired.\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of having agreements if there is no means of promoting enforcement?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe appellate body situation, if we don\u2019t address it, could lead not now but in the future to a paralysis of the dispute settlement mechanism. This would compromise the whole system.\u201d", "author": ["Peter S.

When the boss caught wind of her plans, she was fired. \u201cIt felt like hopelessness,\u201d she said later. \u201cIt felt like this is not going to change. Especially with what\u2019s going on in the media and all the celebrities, and this still happens.\u201d\n\nWomen with wider influence share those anxieties. When Tina Tchen, a lawyer and former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, left the White House, she thought she would quietly restart her legal career focusing on workplace issues. Now she is helping to guide the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, an initiative that sprang up virtually overnight, spearheaded by women in entertainment, and that faces a critical question: whether the more than $20 million donated so far can fund both immediate legal help for low-income workers like Ms. Parra and a longer-term strategy of filing potential landmark cases.\n\nMs. Tchen has also been working with organizations that have faced harassment allegations: the Service Employees International Union, which was particularly embarrassed given its mission of protecting workers; and Pixar Animation, where John Lasseter, perhaps the most revered animator since Walt Disney, recently took a leave of absence.\n\nAcross industries, Ms. Tchen says she sees plenty of resolve for fighting harassment, but a lack of proven mechanisms. \u201cThe tool kit is a little bit bare,\u201d she said, explaining that there is no consensus on how to report a repeat offender who goes from job to job, or address more minor infractions with measures short of suspension or firing.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut among some major corporations, a fear-driven shift has begun: Harassment is now considered not just a legal liability, but also a serious reputational and business risk. Executives and boards are beginning to look at harassment \u201cthe same way you think about other risks to your organization\u201d like security or hacking, said Kaye Foster-Cheek, former head of human resources for Johnson & Johnson and a member of three boards.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell how many workplaces are increasing their efforts. Many do not want to discuss it publicly, for fear of implying that they didn\u2019t do enough in the past. But Microsoft made a bold move in December, eliminating forced confidential arbitration for employees who make sexual harassment claims, saying it didn\u2019t want to pressure those women to stay silent. For the first time, the Screen Actors Guild has introduced a clear code of conduct on harassment, detailing prohibited behavior and vowing to protect members. Facebook recently made public its sexual harassment policy, staking the company to those guidelines. New York University banned romantic relationships between faculty members and undergraduates or anyone over whom they exercise \u201csupervisory authority,\u201d a move that was already under consideration but that passed after the Weinstein allegations. And Seattle enacted new city rules and procedures to ensure respectful behavior on construction sites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor the first time I\u2019m seeing a discussion about, \u2018Even if this behavior doesn\u2019t rise to the level of legal sexual harassment, we won\u2019t tolerate it,\u2019\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president of the Society for Human Resource Management.\n\nIn the past, the burden for uncovering misconduct was almost always on victims, but now some companies are assuming a fact-finding role. More are turning to anonymous but detailed employee surveys with questions like \u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d and \u201cHave you experienced harassment?\u201d If workers say yes, the company won\u2019t know the particulars, but it can initiate investigations or increase training.\n\nIn recent months, Katharine Zaleski, an entrepreneur in New York, has been contacted by two powerful institutional investors, Invesco and Cambridge Associates, that were vetting male venture capitalists whom they were considering funding. They wanted to make sure these men had not behaved problematically, she said. (Invesco declined to comment; Cambridge Associates declined to address specifics, but a spokeswoman said in an email, \u201cWe take culture, policies and conduct very seriously when we consider managers for our clients\u2019 investments.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nMore companies are now accepting that \u201ccomplaint and reporting procedures have failed,\u201d said Freada Kapor Klein, who helped establish the field of sexual harassment training and, as an investor, has helped push through changes at Uber and other companies.\n\nEntrepreneurs are developing new systems for women to report their experiences \u2014 and for businesses to understand what is transpiring. TEQuitable, a platform created by Lisa Gelobter and Heidi Williams, connects workers with real-world support and can send companies anonymized alerts about complaints. Callisto, which is used on campuses to report sexual assaults, is being adapted for workplace use, said Jess Ladd, the founder. Vault, created by Neta Meidav, helps women save evidence and, like Callisto, shows users if others have named the same offender.\n\nMore traditional strategies, like sexual harassment training, are also booming. \u201cI could be booked between now and 10 years from now and still not fulfill the degree of demand,\u201d said Stephen Paskoff, a longtime trainer whose clients include Coca-Cola and Verizon Wireless.\n\nBut the record on workplace harassment training is mixed. California, Connecticut and Maine have required it for years (New York City may soon join them). Those requirements led to a surge in cheap, off-the-shelf training videos and software that could insulate companies from lawsuits, by demonstrating that they had taken measures to prevent harassment, while actually helping perpetuate the problem, because the tutorials were superficial. After harassment allegations surfaced last fall in the Texas Legislature, leaders promised training and then distributed a rote-sounding video and quiz that drew derision.\n\nThe most effective training is expensive, requiring small-group sessions, deep looks at organizational culture and frequent follow-up. But even those who deliver it warn that it is not a complete solution. \u201cDo you think if Harvey Weinstein went to a harassment training class it would have prohibited his behavior?\u201d Mr. Paskoff asked.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd in some cases, the public pressure on companies just means that more quiet financial force is being used. Several employment lawyers say that settlement amounts have been rising. \u201cCases are settling for premium dollars very quickly,\u201d said Debra Katz, a lawyer in Washington, who added that she had settled three cases against chief executives in recent months. Employers are \u201cpaying to avoid the public black eye, being outed as harassers,\u201d she said. (New Jersey and other states are considering bans or limits on secret settlements, setting up what is likely to be a fight between those who argue that the agreements enable harassment by burying the problem and those who stress that they are often a woman\u2019s best recourse.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn industries like food service and cleaning that have typically offered workers fewer protections, the momentum that has picked up in recent months has no clear outlet. Organizers who work with female janitors, fast food workers, hotel housekeepers, nannies and eldercare providers say that women in those fields have become more willing to speak up. But it\u2019s not clear whom they should tell.\n\nEtelbina Hauser, a Honduran immigrant who cleans houses in Seattle, said she felt bolstered by the Hollywood women who spoke out about harassment. \u201cIt makes me feel powerful because I feel like all women are joining together,\u201d she said in Spanish. Two men have exposed themselves to Ms. Hauser while she was cleaning their homes. A third propositioned her for sex. In each case she fled, gave up the job and essentially kept the experience to herself.\n\nSelf-employed workers like Ms. Hauser have no colleagues, no human resources department, no concrete employment policies. \u201cIn many cases no one knows this woman is working there,\u201d said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance.\n\nWhen The New York Times asked a number of low-wage employers if they had taken new steps in recent months to prevent harassment, almost none said yes. Some would not comment; others, including Walmart, Target, Sears Holdings, Subway, Costco, Aramark and ABM Industries, said they already had the right policies and procedures in place.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Gender Letter Coming soon: A newsletter on women, gender and society.

Few of the cases that shocked the court of public opinion in recent months would have been likely to prevail in a real court. The law covers only workplaces with 15 or more employees. The federal statute of limitations for filing a suit can be as short as 180 days. Even when a woman wins her case, damages can be capped at $300,000 \u2014 less if she works at a small company. This month, a jury awarded Rosanna Mayo-Coleman, a sugar refinery worker in New York, $13.4 million in a lawsuit against Domino Sugar\u2019s parent company, but because of the cap she is likely to collect only a fraction of that.\n\nCalifornia legislators are working on what activists hope will be a model for the rest of the country: building up state-level protections for victims of sexual harassment to patch the gaps in the federal rules. One proposed state law extends the statute of limitations. Another specifically defines the business roles it addresses: not just \u201cemployer,\u201d but also producer, director, investor. Another would make supervisors personally liable for any retaliation. \u201cThese are wholesale changes in the law; they are new rights,\u201d said Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, an anti-discrimination group helping to push the California bills.\n\nJust this week, Washington State enacted laws to make it easier for women to come forward about harassment, including by prohibiting nondisclosure agreements that prevent them from describing their experiences.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ultimate solution to sexual harassment, many believe, is having more women in positions of power. Until more women are owners, chief executives and bosses, the dynamic may always be the same: a man calling the shots, and a more junior woman afraid to resist or report. (As Time\u2019s Up grows, this will be its central focus, a leader of the group said; offshoots in advertising and journalism have been announced, and others in sports, technology and venture capital are forming.)\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Renee LaChance, a general contractor in Portland, Ore., was discussing a renovation with a male electrician when he unleashed a stream of explicit comments about her breasts.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you been paying attention?\u201d she asked him, flabbergasted that all the recent news about harassment had not deterred him.\n\nHer solution was simple. \u201cI\u2019m the person in power in the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cI fired him on the spot.\u201d", "author": ["Jodi Kantor"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/economy/tipping-workers.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-25T19:35:44", "title": "Trump Administration Retreats on Tip-Sharing Plan in Compromise", "text": "The tip pool would also have to exclude supervisors, managers and owners. Under the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation, a tip pool could have included those groups.\n\n\u201cThis protects workers from employers and managers skimming their tips and sets up conditions for better wage justice in restaurants and bars across the country,\u201d said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.\n\nAngelo I. Amador, a senior official at the National Restaurant Association, an industry trade group, said in a statement that he was pleased that the new legislation would make it possible for cooks, dishwashers and other workers to share tips. But he expressed concern that \u201cthe enforcement and penalty language for unintentional violations goes too far.\u201d\n\nThe provision would give the secretary of labor broader authority to impose civil penalties on employers who steal tips. For example, workers currently must show that the theft was repeated or willful. Now, civil penalties could be applied to any instance of tip theft.\n\nIn addition to restaurant workers, the rules would apply to tipped employees in other fields, like hairstylists and manicurists.\n\nThe proposed regulation came under particular fire after a report in February that the Labor Department had scaled down its projection for the amount that might be transferred from workers to their bosses, and then abandoned the projection altogether under pressure from Mr. Acosta and the Labor Department.\n\nIt is standard practice for proposed regulations with more than $100 million in economic impact to include an economic analysis, and the Office of Management and Budget typically insists on abiding by that protocol.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter reports emerged that the analysis had been spiked, Democrats in Congress demanded an investigation into the matter and the Labor Department\u2019s inspector general opened an inquiry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During testimony by Mr. Acosta before a congressional committee on March 6, Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned him about the absence of an economic analysis in the proposed regulation and pressed him on why anyone other than workers should be allowed a share of their tips.\n\nMr. Acosta said he did not personally favor allowing managers and owners to siphon tips. But he said the law governing the question, the Fair Labor Standards Act, did not give him the authority to prevent employers from taking tips if the workers were paid the standard minimum wage.\n\nAround the same time, Ms. Murray, the senator from Washington, began negotiations with Mr. Acosta, leading to the provision that was inserted into the spending bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased that Secretary Acosta listened, reversed course and worked with me on legislation to make sure that big businesses can\u2019t steal their workers\u2019 tips,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement renders portions of the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation invalid, but it is unclear whether the department will officially withdraw it. The department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is possible that some high-earning tipped workers would do worse under the compromise. Restaurants would be permitted to set up pools that redistribute their tips to colleagues who often don\u2019t earn tips now.\n\nBut according to Saru Jayaraman, president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a worker advocacy group, the vast majority of workers would benefit from the compromise provision, because such tip-pooling is linked to workers receiving the regular minimum wage, as opposed to the tipped minimum wage, which can be several dollars per hour lower.\n\nFor example, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, while the federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour. Employers who pay tipped workers below $7.25 per hour must make up any difference between that amount and what their workers receive in base wages and tips. (Many cities and states have a far higher minimum wage.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe compromise\u2019s minimum wage requirement changes the math in the employees\u2019 favor. Any restaurant setting up a tip pool that involves non-tipped workers would have to be paying its tipped workers the regular minimum wage, not the reduced wage.\n\nWorkers who previously made $3.25 per hour from their employer and $4 in tips would instead receive their share of the tip pool on top of a $7.25 minimum wage. Even if such workers received slightly less than their usual $4 per hour in tips because some portion of that money was being redistributed, they would almost certainly fare better than if they kept all their tips but had a lower base wage.\n\nMs. Jayaraman pointed to an analysis by her group showing that tipped workers, including the most highly paid tipped workers, typically earn more in the seven states that have done away with the tipped-worker minimum wage than in the states that haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo one tips based on how much you\u2019re earning,\u201d said Ms. Jayaraman, whose group strongly supported the legislative compromise. \u201cThey tip the same amount, and your wages go up.\u201d", "author": ["Noam Scheiber"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/business/steve-wynn-casino-stake.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T03:47:36", "title": "Steve Wynn Agrees to Sell Entire Stake in His Casino Company", "text": "Photo\n\nSteve Wynn, the former chief executive of Wynn Resorts, has agreed to sell all of his remaining eight million shares in the firm, in a swift exit of the casino and hotel company he founded more than 16 years ago.\n\nSeparately, the Macau casino operator Galaxy Entertainment agreed to buy 5.3 million shares of Wynn Resorts at $175 a share, giving it a stake of around 5 percent in the operator, which has resorts in Las Vegas and Macau.\n\nGalaxy is one of six licensed operators in the world\u2019s largest gambling hub of Macau, and competes with Wynn, Sands China, MGM China and Melco Resorts.\n\nMr. Wynn\u2019s share sale comes a week after Wynn Resorts said he and his former wife, Elaine Wynn, who has a 9.26 percent stake, had scrapped a shareholder agreement that prevented them from selling their stakes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wynn resigned last month as chief executive of the company, based in Las Vegas, following claims that he had subjected women who worked for him to unwanted sexual advances.

And if I ask the hummingbird to do extra, if I give it a little bit of extra weight to wear, that can go up to well above 60. So, their tissues are using oxygen at rates that are many, many times what we can possibly achieve.\n\nQ. And they need the oxygen to help them metabolize the relatively enormous amounts of sugar they are taking in to get the energy to power their muscles?\n\nA. I did a calculation back in graduate school. It turns out that when they\u2019re hovering around and foraging during the day, they\u2019re pretty much exclusively burning the sugar that they\u2019ve been eating in the last 30 minutes to an hour. And so, they have this incredible ability to move sugar through their system. And I did the calculation and said, \u2018O.K., if I scale one of my hummingbirds up to adult male human size, my size, how much sugar would I need to drink per minute if I were theoretically a hovering hummingbird as big as I am?\u2019 It turned out to be right around the amount of sugar that\u2019s in a can of Coca-Cola per minute. I haven\u2019t actually tried to do this. My doctor advised against it.\n\nQ. So they move sugar through their system an awful lot faster than we do?\n\nA. Unlike us, hummingbirds can use the glucose that they\u2019re ingesting in nectar and can move it through their guts, through their circulatory system, and to their muscle cells so fast that they can essentially keep that pipeline going in real time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But what\u2019s just as remarkable is that the diet of hummingbirds is nectar and that\u2019s half glucose and half fructose.\n\nFructose is getting a lot of bad press these days because of high fructose corn syrup in the Western diet and its association with metabolic disease and obesity. We\u2019re not good at using fructose at all. Hummingbirds can use that fructose at very high rates.\n\nQ. How do they do it?\n\nA. Birds and nectar-feeding bats have evolved the ability to enhance the flux of nutrients like small sugars like fructose and glucose or amino acids to more effectively absorb their food. And getting them to their tissues is enhanced because hummingbird muscles and hummingbird hearts and hummingbird blood vessels are so good. The hummingbird heart rate is high and it\u2019s pumping so much blood per unit of time. They have lots and lots of capillaries that allow the blood to get up close and personal to their muscle cells.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd hummingbirds can apparently take up fructose in their cells, and we\u2019re trying to figure out what enables that. We do know that there is a different form of glucose transporter that is a specialist at taking up fructose. In our muscle cells that transporter is barely present. But hummingbird muscle fibers tend to have a lot of this transporter. So, we think we\u2019re a little closer to understanding how they can take up fructose so fast. But the story\u2019s not yet complete. We need to do some follow up work in order to really confirm that.\n\nQ. What about your recent work on whether big or small hummingbirds are more efficient at energy use?\n\nA. Hummingbirds really do vary in size. Our Ruby-throated hummingbirds weigh less than a penny, 2.5 to 3 grams. Down in South and Central America, you can find some much larger hummingbird species. Up in the range of 10-12 grams. And then there\u2019s one species, the giant hummingbird, that sits at about 18-20 grams.\n\nIn essence, larger hummingbirds have higher efficiency. They\u2019re converting a greater proportion of their sugar energy into mechanical power to hover than our smallest hummingbirds.\n\nWe think a lot of it probably has to do with the speed at which the muscle fibers need to shorten in order to power those wing beats. Small hummingbirds beat their wings at a higher frequency than larger hummingbirds. It\u2019s something they need to do to generate sufficient mechanical power. But the faster you move or the faster you make a muscle shorten, there is evidence that suggests the less efficiently it does so.\n\nAnd so, what we see is that the apparent efficiency of the smallest hummingbirds is down around 10 percent. If you go up to the larger hummingbirds they are \u2014 they\u2019re up in the range of, you know, 30 percent.", "author": ["James Gorman"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/health/right-to-try-drugs-fda.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-23T22:32:16", "title": "Why Can\u2019t Dying Patients Get the Drugs They Want?", "text": "\u201cYou have to be pretty sophisticated,\u201d said Dr. Arthur L.

At least 38 states have passed local versions of right-to-try laws, which allow patients to sidestep F.D.A. approval once they have received permission from a company.\n\nThe right-to-try measures are opposed by a broad coalition of groups, which contend the bill will not help patients and will undermine the authority of the primary regulatory agency, the F.D.A. Four former F.D.A. commissioners, including two each from Democratic and Republican administrations, oppose the bills, as do dozens of patient groups, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Lung Association.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry, while not taking a position on the issue, has been circumspect. A spokesman for its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said on Friday, \u201cWe believe any legislation must truly benefit and protect patients and not disrupt the future of clinical trials, U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight and the research and approval of new medicines.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s future is unclear. On Thursday, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, failed to secure unanimous consent in the Senate to pass the House version of the bill after it was blocked by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate had already passed its version and that he wanted to work on a compromise bill.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement, Senator Johnson said the next step would be to persuade the House to pass his version.\n\n\u201cPatients and their families are running out of time,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in the statement. \u201cI promise to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of desperate patients for their right to try \u2014 their right to hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSupporters say that right-to-try measures will eliminate an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy \u2014 obtaining approval from the F.D.A.

Drug companies also have many other reasons to bar access \u2014 often, companies do not have enough extra product to give to patients, or they worry that the logistical work of granting access could slow efforts to get the drug approved, when it would become available to any patient who needed it.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the drug does not work \u2014 many experimental products fail in late-stage trials.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Goodman\u2019s son, Jacob, died in 2009 at age 10 of cancer, and she said she asked eight companies for access to their experimental therapies and was turned down every time.\n\nMs. Goodman said that dying patients do need better access to drugs during what she described as the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d period between when there is consensus that a drug works and when it reaches the market.\n\nStill, she said of the companies, \u201cI can understand why they say no, even though my heart was broken so many times.\u201d\n\nSome companies said they would continue to seek F.D.A. permission, even if a right-to-try bill becomes law.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn our view, the F.D.A. plays a really important role,\u201d Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, the chief medical officer of Johnson & Johnson, said in an interview Thursday. Johnson & Johnson initiated a program in 2015 that delegates decisions about early access to a program set up by Dr. Caplan.

Moch, who has since become a proponent of granting fairer access to experimental drugs. (In 2016, Josh died at age 10 of complications from a rare cancer.)\n\nBefore the Hardy family made its request, Mr. Moch said he and his company had been flooded with pleas, ranging from longtime friends to a billionaire, seeking access to the drug, brincidofovir, which still has not been approved by the F.D.A.\n\n\u201cYou get these requests and you have to make your judgment,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the episode, he said dozens of companies had contacted him for advice.

Mr. Lincoff had found his calling.\n\nHe steeped himself in mushroom studies and eventually persuaded the New York Botanical Garden to let him teach despite his lack of formal credentials. In 1978, he published a book on toxic and hallucinogenic mushroom poisoning and was soon recruited to write the National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, which was published in 1981 and is in its 31st printing.

Another theory is that the texturing might trap bacteria, and that a chronic infection could also bring on the cancer.\n\nDoctors and patients sometimes prefer textured implants because they are less likely to shift out of position than smooth ones, as tissue grows into the roughened surface and holds the implant in place.

His record has prompted Senator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the health committee, to oppose his appointment, although some advocates for AIDS patients now say they support him for the job.\n\nA graduate of Georgetown University and its School of Medicine, Dr. Redfield did his residency at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, then stayed on as a researcher in the military, focusing on AIDS. In 1996, he launched the virology institute with Dr. Robert C. Gallo, who developed the blood test for H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus.\n\n\n\nDr. Redfield, 66, has longstanding ties to various government agencies. He served on two advisory panels for the National Institutes of Health from 2002 to 2006, when Mr. Azar was general counsel and then deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human services. Dr. Redfield\u2019s high profile on AIDS research and policy matters has made him a perennial candidate for the C.D.C. job. He has been a small donor to Republican Party committees, giving about $2,000 in total.\n\nIn 2016, the institute was awarded more than $138 million in five-year grants from the C.D.C. to combat H.I.V./AIDS and other health problems in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia. It also has a substantial portfolio of corporate-sponsored research, whose underwriters have included Aventis, Gilead, Human Genome Sciences, Merck and Schering.\n\nKathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor of Maryland, praised Dr. Redfield. \u201cHe has a wonderful bedside manner and is loving and devoted to his patients,\u201d said Ms. Townsend, who served on the institute\u2019s board.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTerry Lierman, chairman of the institute\u2019s Board of Advisors, said Dr. Redfield\u2019s work treating H.I.V. patients who were also addicts made him a great choice for the job.\n\n\u201cIn particular, Dr. Redfield has much experience in treating addiction as a co-morbidity to H.I.V. and incorporating addiction treatment into a patient\u2019s overall primary care,\u201d Mr. Lierman said. \u201cThis appointment is refreshingly not about politics, but about quality, competence and compassion.\u2019\u2019\n\nMedical careers run in Dr. Redfield\u2019s family.

Dr. Redfield\u2019s views on gun violence research and other contentious issues such as access to abortion and sexual health education are not yet known.\n\nHis work in AIDS research and policy has generated concern over the years, in particular for his call in the mid-1980s to late 1980s for widespread AIDS testing and screening of military recruits for H.I.V.\n\nWhile pushing for broader AIDS testing during routine exams as a means to contain the epidemic, Dr. Redfield also called for reducing the stigma associated with the disease. At a congressional hearing in August 1987, Dr. Redfield recommended regular testing, at doctor\u2019s appointments and hospitalizations, as well as for marriage license applicants, and incorporating the test into the practice of medicine, according to news reports. But he also said, \u201cWe have to tell people it\u2019s anti-American to discriminate against people who have the AIDS virus.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Dr. Redfield was the subject of a military investigation after colleagues suspected that he overstated the therapeutic effects of an experimental AIDS vaccine at presentations and in a report. The investigation led to a correction in some published data, according to documents.\n\nSeveral high-level colleagues, however, felt the military should have been tougher on Dr. Redfield, who they felt raised false hopes about the efficacy of a treatment vaccine he was developing.

But in early March, the first calls of the wood frog are like the creaking sounds of an enormous, primitive machine awakening. These ancient voices make my skin crawl and my heart quicken, but these same sounds may have inspired relief in our ancestors; despite the bleak nights, winter was finally at its end.\n\nWood frogs are hardly songsters. Their nasal croaks are best described as resonant, or memorable. They provide a counterpoint to the bell-like clarity of the chorus of spring peepers, which inevitably accompany them. The soft whinnying of screech owls, even the somber hoots of great horned owls, are often a part of this primitive performance. There are few occasions when the elemental vitality of spring is as nakedly exposed.\n\nMeasuring about 3 inches long, and weighing a quarter of an ounce, wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) are woodland wanderers, often traveling long distances between vernal pools. For frogs, they are surprisingly independent of water most of the year, but they are not at all toad-like. Wood frogs have the smooth, thin skin of true frogs, and possess the same long legs. Later in summer, when these frogs are silent, their long leaps are often the only sign they\u2019re present.\n\nPerhaps the wood frog\u2019s most iconic feature is its dark, raccoon-like mask. It is the only masked frog in the Northeast, and though its cowl is almost a clich\u00e9 for roaming the city\u2019s dark corners, it must be one of the least intimidating creatures in the forest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe wood frog often makes a three- or four-foot leap to escape disturbance.

Wiles, a mathematician now at the University of Oxford who proved Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem; Peter D. Lax of New York University; and John F. Nash Jr., whose life was portrayed in the movie \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in 2010, Dr. Langlands, who was born in New Westminster, Canada, near Vancouver, recalled that even though he skipped a grade, he had no intention of going to college until a teacher \u201ctook up an hour of class time to explain to me, in the presence of all the other students, that it would be a betrayal of God-given talents for me not to attend university.\u201d\n\nAt the age of 16, he enrolled at the University of British Columbia, and he later pursued his doctoral studies at Yale.\n\nMore Reporting on Mathematics\n\nAs a professor at Princeton, Dr. Langlands started investigating ideas that connected the mathematics of integers with a generalization of the theory of periodic functions. Periodic functions are repeating patterns like the undulations of a sine wave in trigonometry. More than two centuries ago, mathematicians developed a method called Fourier analysis for describing, for example, the vibrations of a guitar string as the combination of multiple sine waves.\n\nDr. Langlands made use of this type of analysis in curved spaces of higher dimensions (that is, more than the three dimensions of the world we live in) to address fundamental problems in the theory of numbers.\n\nIn 1967, Dr. Langlands spoke with Andr\u00e9 Weil, a prominent French mathematician then at the nearby Institute for Advanced Study, who told him to put his thoughts in writing.\n\nThe result was 17 pages, handwritten. \u201cAfter I wrote it I realized there was hardly a statement in it of which I was certain,\u201d Dr. Langlands wrote apologetically. \u201cIf you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not \u2014 I am sure you have a wastebasket handy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Weil had the letter typed up, and it circulated among other mathematicians, becoming what was known as the \u201cLanglands program.\u201d Dr. Langlands proved a few pieces of it; others have solved additional special cases.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Langlands\u2019s work, for instance, served as one of the starting points in the proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem by Dr. Wiles of Oxford. Pierre de Fermat, a 17th century French mathematician, had asserted that equations of the form an + bn = cn, where a, b, c and n are positive integers, have no solutions when n is greater than two.\n\n\u201cHe never got a Fields medal,\u201d said Peter C.

There is little uniformity in the country\u2019s electronic health systems.\n\nEven the most straightforward part of the project \u2014 DNA sequencing \u2014 is formidable.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough sequencing machines in the U.S. to just focus on our project,\u201d Dr. Dishman acknowledged. All of Us will depend on prices falling for sequencing \u2014 and more sequencers being built.\n\nFor participants, there will be a reward, Dr. Collins noted. The program will give them genetic information and health data, and tell them how they compare to others in the population.\n\nTo do that, All of Us plans to enlist genetic counselors. Yet right now, there are not nearly enough counselors to handle the task.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe counseling issue also bothered Kaiser, Dr. McGlynn said, and it was a factor in the decision to return the grant money.\n\n\u201cGenetic counselors are in terribly short supply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure we were well organized to deliver results in a way that was ethical and not scary to members.\u201d\n\nThe accumulation of tremendous caches of medical data is raising troubling questions about what participants should be told. The U.K. Biobank, for instance, considered returning results to participants, but decided against it after an experiment.\n\nIt involved participants getting whole body scans for the program. For some subjects, a radiologist systematically assessed the scans to see if anything seemed abnormal. If it did, the patient and the patient\u2019s doctor were informed.\n\nAs it turned out, 20 percent of the participants had abnormalities. They often went on to have other tests, some of which were invasive and involved major surgery, like removal of a lobe of the lung.\n\nYet in the end, only one in eight with abnormal scans actually had a medical problem, and even then there was nothing they could do about it most of the time, said Dr. Rory Collins, chief executive of the U.K. project.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is not provide care to individuals, but to generate a resource that can provide health information,\u201d Dr. Collins said. \u201cFeedback can cause more harm than good.\u201d\n\nOther experts disagree with the British approach. At Geisinger, participants are told if they have a genetic variant that might affect their disease risk.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey are offered genetic counseling if they want it \u2014 and so far, about two-thirds do. The medical system has sufficient counselors to handle the demand, said Adam H.

In February, Uber also settled a longstanding legal fight with Waymo.\n\nOn Monday, Uber halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. It is not clear when the company will revive them.\n\nThe Tempe Police Department said it was investigating the crash, and has not determined whether the car was at fault. A Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle equipped with Uber\u2019s sensing technology struck Elaine Herzberg, 49, while it was going 40 miles an hour in a 45-mile-an-hour zone. According to the police, the car, with one safety driver and operating in autonomous mode, did not slow down before impact.\n\nA video shot from the vehicle\u2019s dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down, away from the road. It also appeared that the driver\u2019s hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car. Ms. Herzberg, pushing a bicycle across the street, appeared in the camera right before she was hit.\n\n\u201cAs we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\u201d said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\u201d\n\nUber has been testing its self-driving cars in a regulatory vacuum in Arizona. There are few federal rules governing the testing of autonomous cars. Unlike California, where Uber had been testing since spring of 2017, Arizona state officials had taken a hands-off approach to autonomous vehicles and did not require companies to disclose how their cars were performing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWaymo and Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, reported their \u201cintervention\u201d numbers to California regulators. Uber\u2019s goals in Arizona were mentioned in internal documents \u2014 Arizona does not have reporting requirements \u2014 and it has not been testing self-driving cars in California long enough to be required to report them.\n\nUber\u2019s first road tests in its self-driving car effort, code-named Project Roadrunner, were actually in Pittsburgh in September 2016. The Phoenix area was added a year ago, and quickly became the company\u2019s main testing ground, with 400 employees and more than 150 autonomous cars driving local roads because of \"favorable regulatory environment, favorable weather conditions,\u201d according to a company document.\n\nWhen Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as Uber\u2019s chief executive, he had considered shutting down the self-driving car operations, according to two other people familiar with Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s thinking.\n\nBut he became convinced that it was important to Uber\u2019s long-term prospects. His visit to Phoenix was seen by the Arizona team as a critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress, according to the people familiar with the company\u2019s operations in the Phoenix area. They wanted to take him on a ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so-called edge cases, tricky road situations that are hard to predict.\n\n\u201cWith autonomy, the edge cases kill you, so you\u2019ve got to build out for all the edge cases,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said at a conference in November. \u201cWhich makes it a very, very difficult problem.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.\n\nEarly on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.\n\nA larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document.\n\nAround October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.\n\nWaymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.\n\nBut Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.\n\nMr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.\n\nWhen Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.\n\nUber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.\n\nWaymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.\n\nNot all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \u201clonger-term financial viability.\u201d\n\nAlready, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber\u2019s plans for autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cEvery other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven.

Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.\n\nIt could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.\n\nBoth countries\u2019 efforts to kneecap each other\u2019s tech champions are as much about national security as economic might. Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless internet. Mr. Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm. He did so not because the bidder was Chinese \u2014 Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore \u2014 but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm, leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research \u2014 but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,\u201d said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened before.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.\n\nFor most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.\n\nAnother great paroxysm of worry came in 2013, when Edward J. Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency\u2019s vast surveillance program.\n\nFor China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nA Communist Party-linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China\u2019s information infrastructure.

It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft\u2019s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.\n\nThe Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group\u2019s plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.\n\nIn Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities.

Is the new definition of a commitment-phobe someone who chooses to keep relationships offline?\n\nThen I\u2019m a commitment-phobe. Daily love posts make me want to throw my phone in the street. Public-proposal videos cause me to cover my head and emit feral howling noises. If you have to keep reminding everyone of how happy you are, something\u2019s not right. Happy people don\u2019t need to announce over and over how happy they are. Happy people just \u2026 are. Your friends? They know when you\u2019re in a healthy and loving relationship just by seeing you and knowing you. You don\u2019t need to declare it every time you go online. These constant #relationshipgoals posts doth protest too much.\n\nI get especially weirded out by people who seem interested in cultivating \u201cfans\u201d of their relationship. While it\u2019s cute and flattering to have people make comments like \u201cy\u2019all are goals\u201d and \u201cadopt me\u201d on a picture of you and your lover, I think it creates social pressure to stay in relationships that might actually be unhealthy. One of my good friends stayed with her evil ex for more than a year after she knew she needed to leave, worrying about \u201cletting people down.\u201d\n\nShe had relationship fans. Lots of them.\n\n\u201cI just feel so stupid,\u201d she told me, in tears. \u201cEveryone thinks we\u2019re perfect. I don\u2019t want to disappoint people.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

As my mom would say, \u201cTurn the spotlight off, honey.\u201d Your relationship and/or breakup is not part of the public domain, unless you invite and encourage that. No couple is perfect, and no one knows the private things that happen between the well-edited photos you\u2019ve posted with good lighting on vacation days with your partner. All couples are a mess sometimes. How weird is it to encourage people to envy you as you play the role of someone in a happy relationship?\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a monster. I feel happy and excited when my friends are in loving partnerships. I\u2019m in one, too! And it\u2019s great! I don\u2019t hate all cutesy posts about partners; a few here and there make me coo out loud when I\u2019m lying on the couch scrolling through my social media feeds. \u201cAwww,\u201d I\u2019ll say to the empty room. \u201cLook at them.\u201d And I will tap that \u201clike\u201d button with genuine feeling and search through my emojis for just the right sparkly pink heart and gay rainbow and flame icon.\n\nI love love.

Its core functions are to deploy its algorithms to amplify content that generates strong emotional responses among its users, and then convert what it learns about our interests and desires into targeted ads. This is what makes Facebook Facebook. This is also what makes Facebook such an effective vehicle for promoting so much garbage and what makes it the most pervasive personal surveillance system in the world. As long as that\u2019s true, don\u2019t expect Facebook to fix itself.\n\nHope lies, instead, with our power as citizens. We must demand that legislators and regulators get tougher. They should go after Facebook on antitrust grounds. Facebook is by far the dominant social platform in the United States, with 68 percent of American adults using it, according to the Pew Research Center. That means Facebook can gobble up potential competitors, as it already has with Instagram, and crowd out upstarts in fields such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\nThe Department of Justice should consider severing WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger from Facebook, much as it broke up AT&T in 1982. That breakup unleashed creativity, improved phone service and lowered prices. It also limited the political power of AT&T.\n\nThe European Union has already stepped up its legal efforts to protect data. Its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in May, is intended to ensure that users understand and consent to data collection and how that data is used. Users won\u2019t have to agree to give access to their data to start using a product.\n\nAs with some recent American consumer finance regulations, data collection policies under the new European Union rules must be clear, concise and in plain language. Companies will have to declare up front how they will use the data, and users can withdraw consent at any time. This should significantly deter many abuses that companies like Facebook and Google have committed. It won\u2019t repair the sins of the past. But it\u2019s something.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegulatory interventions have limitations. As long as Facebook is big and rich, its algorithms will determine and distort much of what we read and watch. Our long-term agenda should be to bolster institutions that foster democratic deliberation and the rational pursuit of knowledge. These include scientific organizations, universities, libraries, museums, newspapers and civic organizations. They have all been enfeebled over recent years as our resources and attention have shifted to the tiny addictive devices in our hands.\n\nIf we act together as citizens to champion these changes, we have a chance to curb the problems that Facebook has amplified. If we act as disconnected, indignant moral agents, we surrender the only power we have: the power to think and act collectively. We could even use Facebook to mount campaigns to rein in Facebook. It is, after all, a powerful tool for motivation, even if it\u2019s a terrible tool for deliberation.\n\nSo go ahead and quit Facebook if it makes you feel calmer or more productive. Please realize, though, that you might be offloading problems onto those who may have less opportunity to protect privacy and dignity and are more vulnerable to threats to democracy. If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust, the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse.

But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,\u201d said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.\n\nIf suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. \u201cThis is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.\u201d\n\nIn May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission \u2014 opting in rather than opting out \u2014 after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a January speech in Brussels, Facebook\u2019s Ms. Sandberg said, \u201cWe know we can\u2019t just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.\u201d Google declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum \u2014 and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWith the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. \u201cWe now have a way to hold these companies accountable.\u201d\n\nBut any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.\n\nPrivacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.\n\nIn 2010, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers, called Do Not Track. Two years later, the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.\n\n\u201cIf it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there\u2019s a case to be made for federal regulation\u201d under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.\n\nThe business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two.

Later that night and the next morning, Fin sends me car shipping services, but they aren\u2019t faster or cheaper than what I\u2019d found myself in a few minutes of quick research.\n\nI get frustrated and decided to do the job myself on my commute.

I\u2019m feeling sick, so I ask Magic to schedule me a last-minute doctor\u2019s appointment for the same day. It\u2019s both a challenging request and something I really don\u2019t want to do myself. Magic promises encryption for personal data, so I feel comfortable giving it my health insurance and personal information. It tells me it\u2019ll check back with me in 35 minutes.\n\nMy doctor isn\u2019t available for at least two weeks, so Magic ends up finding me an appointment at an urgent care center. In the end, Magic hands the task back to me \u2014 the doctor\u2019s office won\u2019t let it schedule the appointment for me because of privacy concerns.

I search around on Fiverr and find a virtual personal assistant named Rex, based in Nigeria, who charges $10 an hour and has five-star reviews.\n\nWith Rex, I decide to start with a non-research task: listing some items I want to sell on eBay. But right away, we run into problems. It\u2019s raining hard in Lagos, where Rex is based, and his internet keeps going out. Once the rain eases up, I give him my eBay login information, but before long, eBay has noticed the unusual activity on my account and shuts it down.\n\nAfter we solve that issue, Rex needs my PayPal information, and I remember a conversation with Mr. Chen about protecting personal information. Magic and Fin guarantee security with data encryption, but Rex is working on his home computer. He keeps reassuring me it\u2019s fine, but I decide to switch up the task. Instead, I ask him to research the amount of time I have to find new health insurance. He sends me snapshots of the Covered California website that I don\u2019t find very helpful, but we part on good terms.\n\nCost: $22\n\nBillable time spent: two hours\n\nUpwork\n\nAfter searching the online freelancer marketplace, I selected a Florida-based \u201cpersonal virtual assistant\u201d named Corin because of her 100 percent job success rating, and her low hourly rate ($20). In only a few hours, she accepts my invitation to do the job. With my budget running low, I decide to offer Corin as much as I think she could possibly do in one short hour: check on a medical insurance rule for me, call my bank about my car loan, list the items I still want to sell on eBay.\n\nBefore half the hour had passed, Corin has already sent me a Google doc answering my first two questions, and following up about my eBay products. By the end of the hour, she hasn\u2019t listed everything but tells me she\u2019ll finish the task for no extra charge. For the first time in the experiment, I actually do trust my virtual personal assistant to get things done without draining my wallet.\n\nCost: $20\n\nBillable time spent: one hour\n\nAs the experiment drew to a close, I realized that my initial mistakes had come from the fact that I wanted a personal assistant to do my work, but I didn\u2019t necessarily anticipate the work of managing a personal assistant.

Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook\u2019s user data. \u201cWe also made mistakes, there\u2019s more to do, and we need to step up and do it,\u201d he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.\n\nThis is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.\n\nThe challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.\n\nThe techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America\u2019s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth\u2019s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \u2014 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \u2014 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.\n\nResearchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.\n\nFor the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.", "author": ["Colin Koopman", "The Stone"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/technology/kevins-week-in-tech-zuckerbergs-answers-to-privacy-scandal-raise-more-questions.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-22T22:13:33", "title": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Zuckerberg\u2019s Answers to Privacy Scandal Raise More Questions", "text": "But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s responses also raised more questions.\n\nHere, for example, is how he answered a question about Facebook\u2019s business model, which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data.\n\nRoose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users \u2014 do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks? Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that \u2014 our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can\u2019t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned. Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.\n\nNarrowly, it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services. Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access \u2014 including, in some countries, effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program, which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Especially in countries like Myanmar, where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya, it\u2019s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good, even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term. (And it\u2019s not even clear that it would. People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world, and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network.)\n\nSwitching to a subscription model wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight. There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections, false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion, and innumerable other issues. But moving away from an ad-supported model would make the network harder to exploit. (Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms, for example.) And it would lessen the company\u2019s incentive to sell out its users\u2019 privacy to advertisers.\n\nFacebook has already shown a willingness to try new models. WhatsApp, for example, makes money by charging businesses for an enterprise product that lets them message their customers. And this week, in an announcement immediately buried by an avalanche of other news about the company, Facebook said it was experimenting with a subscription model that would allow popular creators to charge $5 per month for access to their posts.\n\nWhat if all of Facebook cost $5 per month to use, and certain types of divisive and exploitable ad categories and behaviors were removed from the network entirely? Would users revolt en masse, and decide to colonize some other free social media app? Would Facebook collapse without a pipeline of advertising dollars?\n\nMaybe. But being smaller might not be a bad thing. If we\u2019ve learned anything from this year\u2019s troubles, it\u2019s this: Facebook\u2019s platform problems multiply as it gets bigger and more complex, but its ability to deal with those problems stays fairly constant. Zuckerberg might be dedicated to fixing Facebook\u2019s problems, but unless he addresses its biggest problem of all \u2014 its enormous scale, paired with a business model that requires the company to monetize its users\u2019 private data to the greatest extent possible \u2014 there\u2019s only so much he can do.\n\nKevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Can I have a conversation with Google Assistant, or will there be an update in the future that will let me have one?\n\nA. Google Assistant, the company\u2019s voice-based helper software that is similar to Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana software, can already hold basic two-way conversations based on spoken or typed questions and commands. However, more intricate interaction with all these virtual assistant apps is coming as companies expand their research into the scientific areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. (For those with privacy concerns, keep in mind that most virtual assistant software is designed to collect personal data.)\n\nThe Google Assistant software is available as an app for Android and iOS devices, built into Google Home and other speakers, Android-based wearables, cars, televisions, smart-home appliances and other gear. If you are not sure how to talk to the program, the Google Assistant site has a lengthy list of the questions, commands and topics that you can use with the software, complete with suggestions on how to phrase your requests.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

The American troops eventually pushed Japanese forces from Guadalcanal, marking a turning point for the Allies in the Pacific.\n\nBut the Sullivan brothers did not see the outcome of those battles, and they never returned to Waterloo.\n\nFor Kelly Sullivan, the granddaughter of Albert, the youngest of the Sullivan brothers, the discovery of the Juneau was bittersweet.

Then they sent an autonomous underwater device to scan the area using sonar, followed by a remotely operated vehicle with video cameras attached.\n\nWatching that live footage, researchers in the South Pacific aboard the Petrel, a 250-foot exploration vessel, were able to discern the stern of a sunken ship, blooming with translucent anemones.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey remotely maneuvered the underwater vehicle until the letters emblazoned on the stern began to come clear. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the J, there\u2019s the U, N, E, here\u2019s the A \u2014 that\u2019s it.

George, Francis, Joseph, Madison and Albert were gone.\n\nIn response, President Franklin D.

I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate.\n\nThe second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t going to be other different kind of things we\u2019ll also have to fix. But when there\u2019s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem.\n\nSo the actions here that we\u2019re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can\u2019t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we\u2019re going ahead and doing that.\n\nEven if you solve the problem going forward, there\u2019s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people\u2019s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That\u2019s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we\u2019re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren\u2019t doing what Kogan did here.\n\nThe third thing is, it\u2019s really important that people know what apps they\u2019ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we\u2019re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven\u2019t used them for three months.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you\u2019ve connected to and authorized, here\u2019s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity.\n\nKevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: Yes. We\u2019re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we\u2019re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don\u2019t know for certain that they were. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this.\n\nRoose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you\u2019ll be investigating?\n\nZuckerberg: It will be in the thousands.\n\nFrenkel: Were those app developers notified that you\u2019ll be investigating this yet?\n\nZuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we\u2019ll be reaching out in the near term.\n\nFrenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations?\n\nZuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we\u2019re going to have to grow the team to work on this.\n\nRoose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it?\n\nZuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it\u2019s a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it\u2019s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well.\n\nThe point of what we\u2019re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn\u2019t mean that \u2014 if you\u2019re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people.\n\nFrenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don\u2019t have any people\u2019s data from our community and that they\u2019ve deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We\u2019re working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We\u2019re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there\u2019s no wrongdoing here.\n\nRoose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn\u2019t you suspend them then?\n\nZuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 \u2014 some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

We banned Kogan\u2019s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn\u2019t have the data, and weren\u2019t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision.\n\nFrenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted?\n\nZuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false.\n\nAgain, we haven\u2019t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can\u2019t say definitively that they actually have data. I\u2019ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data.\n\nFrenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: Yes, we\u2019re investigating that too.\n\nRoose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that\u2019s been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend?\n\nZuckerberg: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it\u2019s not good. I think it\u2019s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don\u2019t feel good about using Facebook, that\u2019s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.\n\nFrenkel: We\u2019re now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won\u2019t be used this way again?\n\nZuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There\u2019s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community.\n\nNow, the good news here is that these problems aren\u2019t necessarily rocket science. They\u2019re hard, but they\u2019re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they\u2019re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere.\n\nOne of the things that gives me confidence is that we\u2019ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France.\n\nIn last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven\u2019t talked about publicly before, so you\u2019re the first people I\u2019m telling about that.\n\nI feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we\u2019re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections?\n\nZuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we\u2019ve done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I\u2019ll say something about him in a second. He\u2019s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I\u2019m hopeful he\u2019ll be engaged for a while here on that.\n\nOne of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It\u2019s not all A.I., right? There\u2019s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we\u2019re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We\u2019ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it\u2019s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It\u2019s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the \u201990s, now they\u2019re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we\u2019ve made, like O.K., if you\u2019re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can\u2019t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.\n\nRoose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users \u2014 do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?\n\nZuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that \u2014 our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can\u2019t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.\n\nNow, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.\n\nRoose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook\u2019s role in the violence in Myanmar. You\u2019ve said you\u2019re \u201coutraged\u201d about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: That\u2019s a good question. I think, you know, we\u2019re doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we\u2019re seeing is, there are new challenges that I don\u2019t think anyone had anticipated before.\n\nIf you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I\u2019d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other\u2019s elections, there\u2019s no way I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.\n\nI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible to know every issue that you\u2019re going to face down the road.

Those questions have only intensified as the company has faced criticism over the role its platform played in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election and the way it has been used to spread misinformation on the internet.\n\nThe resulting backlash is Facebook\u2019s worst crisis since it was founded by Mr. Zuckerberg and others in 2004. The information, photos and other content that users post and their frequent engagement with the platform is crucial to the social network, and to the company\u2019s profitability. Questions about user privacy and security threaten the company\u2019s standing at a time when people are already uneasy about whether the use of technology can bring good or ill.\n\nLast Friday, after The New York Times, The Observer of London and Channel 4 in Britain told Facebook that Cambridge Analytica had not deleted all of the data it had obtained, the social network banned the political consulting firm and Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who created the personality quiz app that was used to harvest user data.\n\n\u201cThis was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday. \u201cBut it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it.\u201d\n\nFacebook representatives confirmed that Cambridge Analytica representatives met with Facebook on Tuesday to discuss lifting the ban.

Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s troubles there were illustrated by the final passage on Wednesday of a bill to combat sex trafficking. The bill would lift liability protections that internet companies have enjoyed for content that users post on their platforms. Facebook and other internet giants had quietly fought the bill for more than a year, but eventually dropped their opposition.\n\nLawmakers who have demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg testify before Congress about Facebook\u2019s relationship with Cambridge Analytica were not appeased by his statement.\n\n\u201cYou need to come to Congress and testify to this under oath,\u201d Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, tweeted in response to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s post.\n\nIndependent researchers who have used data from Facebook said that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s statement did not acknowledge how the gathering of user data was fundamental to the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cHe avoided the big issue, which is that for many years, Facebook was basically giving away user data like it was handing out candy,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. \u201cThere is no question that handing out that data made Facebook the success it is as a company. This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one-off problem.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook\u2019s dealings with Cambridge Analytica. He traced the information-sharing issue to 2007, when Facebook decided to become an open platform \u2014 enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher, created a personality quiz app that about 300,000 people installed, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Because Facebook was an open platform, Mr. Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA year later, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third-party apps could access. \u201cThese actions would prevent any app like Kogan\u2019s from being able to access so much data today,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBy 2015, Mr. Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica, which later used the material to single out American voters. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr. Kogan\u2019s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted. He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s an issue where someone\u2019s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to, that\u2019s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in the interview.\n\nFor Mr. Zuckerberg, the outcry over Cambridge Analytica has been personally damaging. Inside Facebook, even his staunch supporters have described a tense atmosphere. Some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions, such as the messaging app WhatsApp and the photo-sharing platform Instagram, calling their work on Facebook\u2019s main product \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d\n\nMr. Zuckerberg spent part of the past week hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make information on Facebook\u2019s users more secure, and to potentially give them more control of their data, according to two Facebook employees who declined to be named because the proceedings were confidential.\n\nHis silence on the matter has prompted mounting criticism in the past few days. Facebook held a staff meeting on Tuesday to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the surrounding outcry, but Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the event. He was scheduled to appear at a staff meeting that was set for Friday.\n\nIn his interview with The Times, Mr. Zuckerberg said that the company\u2019s efforts to safeguard its platform from bad behavior \u2014 which includes preparing for possible interference attempts in the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 were an important part of a larger transformation at the company, which has had to adjust from its roots as a social network for college students into a powerful global information hub.\n\n\u201cIf you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I\u2019d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other\u2019s elections, there\u2019s no way I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.", "author": ["Sheera Frenkel", "Kevin Roose"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/personaltech/delete-facebook.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-21T23:47:50", "title": "Want to #DeleteFacebook? You Can Try", "text": "What are the alternatives to using Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp?\n\nThere is no real substitute for Facebook if you\u2019re looking for a social network that includes virtually everyone you meet in real life. Social networks are all about the people on them, and Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users. You could consider Snapchat, which has about 187 million daily users, but it\u2019s a far different experience \u2014 you primarily use it to send photos that self-destruct \u2014 with an interface that many people find confusing.\n\nThere are plenty of alternatives to WhatsApp. But they have drawbacks and aren\u2019t as far-reaching as WhatsApp, which has more than 1.5 billion monthly users.\n\nSignal is a solid app for secure encrypted messaging \u2014 but it is still a young service with a relatively small number of users. You might be able to get hundreds of your friends to join Signal. But chances are you have friends or family in other countries, and WhatsApp is the go-to messaging service internationally. For example, practically every smartphone user in India \u2014 more than 200 million people \u2014 uses WhatsApp.\n\nAnother WhatsApp alternative is WeChat, a Chinese messaging app that has about a billion monthly users. But the majority of people on that service are in China. And WeChat faces its own privacy issues because of China\u2019s notorious reputation for mass surveillance. Tencent, the company that runs WeChat, denies that it stores the chat histories of its users. But WeChat users have been arrested over conversations they have had in the app, and chat transcripts have been used as evidence in court proceedings.\n\nInstagram, which has more than 800 million monthly users, is also a tough one, giving Facebook a stranglehold on photo sharing. The only real competitor to Instagram is Facebook itself, which has its own photo-sharing features. Remember Flickr? The Yahoo-owned site is the closest thing either has to a competitor, and it\u2019s like a graveyard of people\u2019s digital memories before they abandoned it for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nGoogle Photos is a compelling service, but it is a photo album management tool, not so much a social network.\n\nHow else do you keep in touch with friends and family?

But if you have the patience, you can juggle multiple apps to cobble together the same experience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMessaging apps are popular for keeping in touch with friends and family \u2014 a group chat between family members via text message, for example, is still an efficient way to keep in touch. And sites like MeetUp are designed for hosting and discovering events.\n\nAs for customer service, many companies use Twitter to engage with their customers and resolve complaints. Yelp, the reviews site for local businesses, is a common place for customers to talk about their experiences, and business owners often engage with people there.\n\nFor grass-roots movements, a Twitter hashtag might be enough. Recent examples include #metoo, the movement for people to discuss sexual assault, #deleteuber, the campaign to protest Uber last year amid political controversy, and now, there is the movement to #deletefacebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica controversy.\n\nWhat does it mean to delete Facebook? How can you actually delete your account?\n\nYou can permanently delete your account by clicking a few buttons on Facebook\u2019s website. The company delays deletion for a few days, so do not log back in. Facebook also offers a tool for extracting a copy of your data before deleting your account.\n\nAfter you delete your account, it won\u2019t be recoverable. But there are caveats.\n\nShadows of your digital self would remain on the site. For example, if people uploaded photos of you, those photos will still be there. The conversations you had with friends through Facebook won\u2019t disappear, either.\n\nWhen you delete your account, you are only deleting the media you posted, like your status updates and photos that you uploaded. That\u2019s not going to do much for your privacy, considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people. All of your friends (and their friends, too) would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect.\n\nWhat other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook? Why do so many apps require a Facebook login?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third-party apps and websites that are tied to your account. Over the past decade, many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company\u2019s login tool, Facebook Login.\n\nFacebook Login became popular because it was a good product. By clicking a button, you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data. That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address \u2014 a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen. This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale.\n\nIf you were to delete Facebook, you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login. But fortunately, many sites and apps still let you sign up for accounts directly through them, and many also let you log in through your Google account.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to delete Facebook. But it would be a long and tedious process to create new accounts for all the apps and sites you use.\n\nWhere does Facebook really equal the internet?\n\nKeep in mind that Facebook reaches well beyond the United States. As my colleague Sheera Frenkel noted on Twitter, deleting Facebook is a privilege. In some parts of the world, like Myanmar, Egypt and Indonesia, people rely on Facebook as a primary means to conduct business and stay in touch with friends and family.

In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook\u2019s users more secure, with more control of their data.\n\nKate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company\u2019s business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis. In 2006, users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed, which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network.

Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. \u201cBut the I.R.S. is the one agency you don\u2019t want to mess with.\u201d\n\nTaxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into \u201cprivacy coins,\u201d such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users\u2019 transactions.\n\nCryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology\u2019s stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it\u2019s possible for users to conceal their identities.\n\nUntil recently, the I.R.S. showed little desire to go after cryptocurrency income, since there was so little of it. But last year\u2019s boom changed all that. The agency has formed a team of specialists to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes, including international money laundering and tax evasion. In November, after a yearlong lawsuit, the agency won a judgment that forced Coinbase, the largest American-based cryptocurrency exchange, to turn over account records for more than 14,000 customers. In January, Coinbase sent 1099-K forms to a number of its current users, informing them that their trading proceeds were being reported to the I.R.S. and reminding them to pay the taxes they owed.\n\nAll of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon.\n\nMario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,\u201d Mr. Costanz said.\n\nLaura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA lot of crypto investors are younger and don\u2019t have a lot of experience trading stocks,\u201d she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, \u201ca lot of people are kind of shocked.\u201d\n\nPart of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else \u2014 whether you\u2019re cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee \u2014 you\u2019re creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for.\n\nComplicating matters even more, the timing of last year\u2019s cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year\u2019s market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year\u2019s gains.\n\nMs. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. \u201cNow they\u2019re stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don\u2019t have the capital to pay it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.\n\nThe combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.\n\nOne big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.\n\nWhat is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like?\n\nMumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here. Two huge outsourcing companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, also have their headquarters here.\n\nBollywood, India\u2019s film industry, is centered in Mumbai, too. So services like Hotstar, Amazon Prime and Eros Now are here to be close to the studios.

Do you think e-wallets will ever replace cash?\n\nTraditional e-wallets, where you store money until you need to spend it, will probably disappear. The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.\n\nI doubt cash will ever disappear, though. Even in the United States, about one-third of all transactions are still cash.\n\nBeyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?\n\nAir purifiers!\n\nLike China, India has a big problem with air pollution in its major cities. Unlike China, the government is doing very little to address the problem.\n\nIn New Delhi, the nation\u2019s capital, the wintertime air is so bad that its chief minister called it a \u201cgas chamber.\u201d In Mumbai, which is on the coast and gets nice ocean breezes, the air tends to be better.

Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.\n\nThose processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.\n\nAs a book written by the two researchers in 1989, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, became the standard text for chip design, even Intel took a partial step toward the RISC idea.

But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\n\n\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.\n\nNo Free Wi-Fi\n\nOnly seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.\n\nMr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.\n\nCity Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201d\n\nMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things.

If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201d\n\nSince that June 2011 meeting, the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestion has doubled to 66,000. About 300,000 new jobs have been created, pushing the median apartment rental rate up 37 percent and the median cost of a home to $968,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, the big companies \u2014 not only Apple but Amazon, which has an increasingly large presence in Silicon Valley, as well as Facebook and Google \u2014 are much wealthier.\n\nApple built a $5 billion campus that, for all its splendor, is not readily accessible by mass transit. That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.\n\nSo the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around.

At the time, after surveillance disclosures by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, Silicon Valley companies were adding anti-surveillance protections including encryption to their data centers and messaging tools. Washington accused tech companies of going too far, and the F.B.I. pressed companies like Apple to weaken their encryption or build in a government back door.\n\nIn February 2015, at a cybersecurity conference in Washington, Mr. Stamos stood up to Adm. Michael S.

Some at the social network worried aloud whether he was too much of a firebrand to join the social network, according to three current and former Facebook employees who declined to be named because of nondisclosure agreements. But others argued that his activism was a benefit for the company.\n\nMr. Stamos joined Facebook in June 2015. From the start, the current and former employees said, he got off on the wrong foot with some executives, including Ms. Sandberg, over how best to police the platform. Facebook was increasingly grappling with cyberattacks from countries like Iran, whose hackers were caught trying to break into the accounts of State Department employees, and from Russia, the current and former employees said.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nAfter a breach of the Democratic National Committee in June 2016, Mr. Stamos pulled together a team to investigate Russian interference on Facebook. The findings pit him against executives in the company\u2019s legal and communications groups. While Mr. Stamos argued to disclose more, others said that by proactively disclosing what they had found, Facebook had become a target of further public ire, according to seven current and former Facebook employees.\n\nInternally, Mr. Stamos repeatedly argued that Facebook needed to act more like a defense contractor in dealing with security, given that the social network was becoming a similar target for nation states.\n\nIn audio leaked in October to ZDNet, a tech news site, he told his security team that he explained to management \u201cthat we have the threat profile of a Northrop Grumman or a Raytheon or another defense contractor, but we run our corporate network, for example, like a college campus, almost.\u201d\n\nThe tape infuriated Mr. Stamos\u2019s bosses, according to the current and former employees. A leak investigation is continuing, two of the people said. They said some executives believed Mr. Stamos had leaked the audio himself to get Facebook to take his entreaties more seriously.\n\nMr. Stamos later tweeted that the audio was \u201cnot a criticism of anybody, just a statement of why our team needs to be creative in how we protect our corporate network.\u201d\n\nBy October, the relationship between Mr. Stamos and Ms. Sandberg had deteriorated over how to handle Russian interference on Facebook and how best to reorganize Facebook\u2019s security team before the midterm elections, according to more than half a dozen people who work or formerly worked at the company. Mr. Stamos proposed that instead of reporting to Facebook\u2019s general counsel, Colin Stretch, he report directly to Facebook\u2019s higher-ups.\n\nInstead, executives released Mr. Stamos from much of his day-to-day responsibility, employees said.\n\nMr. Stamos has said his remaining days at Facebook will be spent \u201cexploring emerging risks and working on election security.\u201d", "author": ["Nicole Perlroth", "Sheera Frenkel"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/technology/att-time-warner-trial-explained.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-20T23:37:10", "title": "AT&T-Time Warner Case: How the Biggest Antitrust Trial in Years Could Play Out", "text": "Photo\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s case to block AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s $85 billion blockbuster merger heads to trial this week, with opening statements expected on Thursday.

This means that for the first time in history we have no idea what to teach in schools.\u201d\n\nLeaders focus on the past because they lack a meaningful vision of the future.\n\nLeaders and political parties are still stuck in the 20th century, in the ideological battles pitting the right against the left, capitalism versus socialism. They don\u2019t even have realistic ideas of what the job market looks like in a mere two decades, Mr. Harari said, \u201cbecause they can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cInstead of formulating meaningful visions for where humankind will be in 2050, they repackage nostalgic fantasies about the past,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a kind of competition: who can look back further. Trump wants to go back to the 1950s; Putin basically wants to go back to the Czarist Empire, and you have the Islamic State that wants to go back to seventh-century Arabia. Israel \u2014 they beat everybody. They want to go back 2,500 years to the age of the Bible, so we win. We have the longest-term vision backwards.\u201d\n\n\u2018There is no predetermined history.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now living with the collapse of the last story of inevitability,\u201d he said. The 1990s weres flush with ideas that history was over, that the great ideological battle of the 20th century was won by liberal democracy and free-market capitalism.\n\nThis now seems extremely na\u00efve, he said. \u201cThe moment we are in now is a moment of extreme disillusionment and bewilderment because we have no idea where things will go from here. It\u2019s very important to be aware of the downside, of the dangerous scenarios of new technologies. The corporations, the engineers, the people in labs naturally focus on the enormous benefits that these technologies might bring us, and it falls to historians, to philosophers and social scientists who think about all of the ways that things could go wrong.\u201d\n\nIn a complex, interconnected world, morality needs to be redefined.\n\n\u201cTo act well, it\u2019s not enough to have good values,\u201d Mr. Harari said. \u201cYou have to understand the chains of causes and effects.\u201d\n\nStealing, for example, has become so complicated in today\u2019s world. Back in biblical times, Mr. Harari said, if you were stealing, you were aware of your actions and their consequences on your victim. But theft today could entail investing \u2014 even unwittingly \u2014 in a very profitable but unethical corporation that damages the environment and employs an army of lawyers and lobbyists to protect itself from lawsuits and regulations.\n\n\u201cAm I guilty of stealing a river?\u201d asked Mr. Harari, continuing his example. \u201cEven if I\u2019m aware, I don\u2019t know how the corporation makes its money. It will take me months and even years to find out what my money is doing. And during that time I\u2019ll be guilty of so many crimes, which I would know nothing about.\u201d\n\nThe problem, he said, is understanding the \u201cextremely complicated chains of cause and effect\u201d in the world. \u201cMy fear is that homo sapiens are not just up to it. We have created such a complicated world that we\u2019re no longer able to make sense of what is happening.\u201d", "author": ["Kimiko De Freytas-Tamura"]}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000005808005/yuval-noah-harari-on-the-future-of-humanity.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "published": "2018-03-20T03:36:38", "title": "Yuval Noah Harari on the Future of Humanity", "text": "Humans, Mr. Harari warned, \u201chave created such a complicated world that we\u2019re no longer able to make sense of what is happening.\u201d", "author": ["The New York Times"]}]}, "cnnmoney": {"rss": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss/", "link": "http://money.cnn.com/", "articles": [{"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_latest/~3/5ZmD9RsYd3A/index.html", "published": "2018-03-25T19:35:08", "title": "Stormy Daniels interview adds to \"60 Minutes\" legacy of big hits", "text": "Over the decades \"60 Minutes\" has featured everyone from CEOs to presidents to whistleblowers to tyrants.\n\nBut this Sunday is a first.\n\nAmerica's highest-rated news program is airing an interview with an adult film star known as Stormy Daniels.

In an unusual move, the network has not released any preview clips, just a single 10-second tease of Cooper asking her a question.\n\nRelated: Fox News shelved story on Trump and porn actress Stormy Daniels before election\n\nThe logic is clear: At this point, practically everyone knows the interview is airing on Sunday, so there's no need to give away any of the newsworthy quotes ahead of time.\n\nAvenatti has said that Daniels was \"physically threatened\" to stay silent about the alleged affair. He has also said that she has evidence of the relationship.\n\nThe details may come out on \"60 Minutes.\" But Avenatti might be trying to lower expectations now. He tweeted on Sunday morning that \"not all of our evidence will be mentioned/displayed tonight -- that would be foolish.\"\n\nHe also said \"we are not sure what CBS will include but we know a lot from the full interview will have to be cut\" due to time constraints.\n\nThat's true -- but the Stormy story will be double the length of a typical \"60 Minutes\" segment. Normally \"60\" features three stories on an hour-long show. On Sunday, there's only one other story slated to air.\n\nThe president is expected to arrive back in Washington, D.C., shortly before \"60\" airs. His wife Melania will remain at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"The First Lady will be staying in Florida as is their tradition for spring break,\" deputy White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said Sunday.\n\nThere's already widespread speculation about whether Trump will tweet about the broadcast.\n\n\"Trump is such a creature of television.

But the real fear among businesses, investors and lawmakers: Escalation.\n\nThis could just be the beginning -- \"the first of many\" trade actions, as President Trump put it Thursday.\n\nTrump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese exports. On Friday, Trump's global tariffs on steel and aluminum, which includes China, went into effect. Responding to those two latter tariffs, China said it would impose tariffs on $3 billion of US exports to China.\n\nIf it ends there, the skirmish is unlikely to have serious global implications. But the pain of higher costs and prices will be felt by workers, businesses and consumers, both directly and indirectly.\n\nHere's what we know, and what might be in store in the future.\n\nThe US will hit Chinese tech and industry\n\nThe United States will impose a tariff of 25% on steel coming from China and a 10% tariff on its aluminum. Most nations will be subjected to same US-imposed duties.\n\nThe Trump administration will also slap a 25% tariff on a range of unannounced products from China, including, but not limited to, communication technology, aerospace, information, and machinery. This comes after a US investigation concluded China systematically discriminated against US tech companies operating in that country.\n\nThese are key trading items. In 2017, the US imported about $150 billion worth of products from China across all those categories. The imports were heavily weighted toward computer and semiconductor equipment, according to US government data and Panjiva, a research firm recently acquired by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nChina is hitting US farmers and vineyards\n\nChina announced Friday it would put tariffs on 128 US exports in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, according to China's Commerce Ministry. More tariffs could come in retaliation to the US tariffs related to the tech probe.\n\nChina's tariffs on US goods would mostly target wine, fruit, pork, recycled aluminum and nuts. A full list has not yet been published, but the tariffs would take effect March 31. Tariffs would range from 15% to 25%, depending on the product.\n\nAll those imports total $3 billion per year, a relatively small amount.\n\nThat's just where it begins, though.\n\nChina is the top customer for America's 300,000 soybean farmers. China bought 61% of US soybean exports last year, according to the US Soybean Export Council. So far, China has not mentioned it would tariff US soy, but the foreign ministry ominously reminded reporters last week of that figure.\n\nChina also doesn't have to slap tariffs on American farmers to punish the US. It could simply do more business with South America.\n\nBrazilian soy exports to China surged nearly 35% last year compared to the year prior while US soy was only up 2%, according to Panjiva. Brazil ships more soy to China, its top trade partner, than the United States does. Experts say the surge last year was not related to trade policy, but it shows how China has another alternative to US soy.\n\nChina owns more US government debt than any other nation -- and its appetite could cool\n\nChina owns $1.17 trillion of US government debt, according to the Treasury Department. That makes it America's biggest lender. China's holdings move slightly up and down, but as of January they were at a six-month low.\n\nIt's unlikely China would dump a lot of its US Treasury bonds all at once -- after all, a major debt sale like that would cause prices for the US debt remaining in its portfolio to go down.\n\nThe real problem: What if China loses its appetite and doesn't buy much more US debt?\n\nThe United States government needs to issue nearly $1 trillion debt this fiscal year to cover its deficit, which is expected to swell more in the years to come because of the GOP tax cuts. To fund a deficit, the US sells more debt to other nations, foreign investors, American citizens and US banks. It's considered one of the safest investments in the world.\n\nIt's impossible to know what would happen if China stopped buying US debt, or significantly slowed its purchases. But at a minimum, it's not an ideal time for the US to aggravate its biggest lender.\n\nIs it the end of the global economy as we know it?\n\nThat question sounds dramatic, but the global perceptions of China and the US on trade are reversing.\n\nThe United States has been the poster child for free trade since World War II and China the ultimate protectionist. Now, the US is seeking tariffs while China, at least rhetorically, says it wants to fight protectionism.\n\nThe presidents of Chile and Colombia both described the scenario as \"the world upside down.\"\n\nFree trade economists say the US is forfeiting its leadership role in global trade, while the Trump administration argues it's trying to make trade benefit more Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, China is expanding its global footprint, seeking to develop an ambitious global trade highway known as the One Belt, One Road Initiative.\n\nAnd geopolitical implications are endless, including reverberations with North Korea, Russia, Iran, Latin America, and the Middle East. Trade experts argue that economic links like trade help prevent real wars. They make countries more dependent on each other, those experts say, and less likely to pursue armed conflicts.\n\nIs Trump's bite as bad as his bark?\n\nAll these concerns could be much ado about nothing. Trump was set to impose the steel and aluminum tariffs on every country. Top allies, and trade partners, were threatening retaliation.\n\nThen Trump gave exemptions to Mexico, Canada, the European Union, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Argentina. That means the top four steel exporters to the US and four of the top seven aluminum exporters won't face the tariff.\n\nTrump also repeatedly threatened to tear up NAFTA, the trade deal between the US, Canada and Mexico. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been pessimistic about talks for months, told senators Thursday that all three sides are now making meaningful progress.\n\nTrump's tariffs stemming from the tech investigation on China don't take effect for two weeks.

Wall Street's trade nightmare: President Trump's crackdown on China shocked Wall Street.\n\nThe nerves make sense. There are no winners in a trade war, especially not when the world's two largest economies fight one.\n\nBut investors shouldn't have been caught off guard by Trump's tough stance. He has been remarkably consistent on trade \u2014 for years, if not decades.\n\n\"China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs,\" Trump said in his June 2015 presidential announcement speech, which mentioned China 26 times.\n\nTrump complained that day that the United States never beats China in a trade deal. \"They kill us,\" he said, echoing comments he's made since at least the 1980s.\n\nYet Wall Street chose to ignore this trade risk \u2014 until now.\n\nAfter Trump's election, euphoric investors focused exclusively on the pro-growth elements of his agenda \u2014 lower taxes, lighter regulation and more infrastructure spending. The market largely ignored the anti-growth parts, namely tighter trade and immigration policies.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise. He campaigned on it,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital.\n\nLuschini noted that Peter Navarro, a top Trump trade official, wrote a book called \"Death by China.\"\n\n\"We're getting what we were told we were going to get,\" Luschini said.\n\nRelated: Trade fears add to concerns of a downturn\n\nBarclays chief US economist Michael Gapen said in a report that \"we have long believed protectionist policies are at the core of the president's agenda.\" Gapen noted that \"his rhetoric against trade extends back to the 1980s.\"\n\nWall Street's early focus on taxes and regulation paid off while Trump was executing that part of his agenda, lifting the market to record highs. The tax law has been especially helpful to big business and shareholders.\n\nBut as Gapen notes, \"anti-trade policies, particularly tariffs, act like a tax on consumers and business by raising the cost of trade.\"\n\nInvestors had understandably hoped that Trump would be dissuaded from protectionist moves by free trade supporters like Gary Cohn, the former chief economic adviser, and Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state.\n\nBut both Cohn and Tillerson are gone now, clearing the way for trade hawks like Navarro, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Cohn's replacement, Larry Kudlow, is a fierce defender of free trade.\n\n\"Kudlow, when is your first day at work?\" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in a report. \"How far does this go? How much will it cost American business and American consumers as we find out?\"\n\nInvestors still hope Trump can be talked off the trade war ledge. Consider how Trump's bark ended up being worse than his bite on steel and aluminum tariffs, which have been watered down significantly.\n\nIf Trump does walk back his stance on China, it may be the stock market that is the catalyst. After all, Trump views the market as a report card. And last week's grades weren't pretty.\n\n2. Tariff tensions: Investors may look back on last week as the first big step toward a trade war.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced tariffs on about $50 billion worth of imports to punish China for stealing American tech and trade secrets. The United States also plans to restrict Chinese investment and take action against China at the World Trade Organization.\n\nChina has already said it's considering tariffs on $3 billion worth of US goods, including fresh and dried fruits, nuts, wine, steel pipes, pork and recycled aluminum. Those would be retaliation against the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump announced earlier this month.\n\nAltogether, China's list includes 128 American products.\n\nIf China retaliates further, American farmers and companies like Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC), which do a lot of business in China, could be at risk.\n\nWithin the next two weeks, the US trade representative will publish a list of targeted goods, and China will probably get more specific. Investors are sure to be paying attention.\n\nRelated: China plans to hit US with tariffs following Trump trade sanctions\n\n3.

That's because Tyson is covered by Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.\n\nNew Mexico leads all other states in Medicaid enrollment, with 43% of its residents on the program. Nearly a third of the 900,000 New Mexico beneficiaries joined as part of the Affordable Care Act's option to expand Medicaid.\n\nKaiser Health News is examining Medicaid's role in the U.S. as the health care program comes under renewed fire from Republicans who generally want to put the brakes on it, even as many Democrats credit the expansion with reducing the number of uninsured Americans to historic lows. Conservatives view the costs as prohibitive for state and federal budgets.\n\nNina Owcharenko, a senior research fellow in health policy with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the enrollment boost is \"not a positive story.\" While the high enrollment underscores the pervasive poverty in New Mexico, it also signals surging costs for taxpayers, she said.\n\n\"I am growing more concerned about the cost of shifting Medicaid dollars to the federal government and without a budget cap on the program,\" she said. \"That is a dangerous fiscal course for the country.\"\n\nIn Gallup, a city of about 23,000 people, Medicaid is as much a part of the fabric as Native American-crafted jewelry and green chile sauce. Recipients include the waitress at the downtown bar, the clerk at a loan store and the maid at the hotel.\n\nAnd multi-generational families are common in Gallup and surrounding McKinley County. Tyson's mother, grandmother, aunt and uncle also are enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nSome 52% of the county's residents have coverage through the program. That's the highest rate among U.S. counties with at least 65,000 people, according to a KHN analysis of Census data.\n\n\"Pretty much everybody is on Medicaid here,\" said Libby Garcia, 36, who lives in a trailer overlooking downtown Gallup.\n\nGarcia, who works as a custodian at a local Head Start agency, quit a second job cleaning businesses because that extra income would put her over the eligibility level for coverage. She can't afford private insurance, and Medicaid gives her free care at a community health center and insulin and other medicines for her diabetes without out-of-pocket costs, she said.\n\nMcKinley, where more than 40% of the population lives below the federal poverty level of $12,140 for an individual, is the nation's only county of at least 65,000 people in which more than half the population is on Medicaid.\n\nIn McKinley County, many residents see Medicaid as vital. There's no stigma around it, and enrollees and providers speak positively about it.\n\nThe heavy concentration of Medicaid in this high-altitude desert is a result of two factors: the high poverty rate and the Indian Health Service's relentless work to enroll patients in the program.\n\nLarge swaths of McKinley County lie within the Navajo Nation, the largest Indian reservation in the United States. Nearly 80% of McKinley County's 75,000 residents are Native American.\n\nRelated: Trump administration allows states to make Medicaid recipients work\n\nMedicaid enrollees in Gallup say the coverage has opened up new opportunities for them to get more timely care, especially surgery and mental health services. It has been vital in combating high rates of obesity, teen birth, suicide and diabetes, according to local health officials.\n\nFor the Gallup Indian Medical Center \u2014 the main Indian Health Service facility in the area \u2014 Medicaid has stoked the local budget and eased overcrowding. When patients on Medicaid are treated there, the center is reimbursed by the program. That money supplements the Indian Health Service's annual federal grant, which is set by Congress.\n\nLast year, Medicaid funding made up 34% of the center's $207 million budget. Among all US hospitals, Medicaid provided only 18.5% of revenue.\n\n\"Medicaid has become the safety net for the Indian Health Service,\" said John Ratmeyer, deputy chief of pediatrics at the Gallup Indian Medical Center. \"It's providing an extra pod of money to pay for services not within our hospital system.\"\n\nMedicaid this year is projected to add more than $800 million to Indian Health Service hospital funding, supplementing the $4.8 billion in annual federal appropriation.\n\nRelated: Millions of Medicaid recipients already work\n\nThe county has a host of medical challenges related to its economic problems. According to a 2016 report sponsored by Rehoboth McKinley, the county's suicide rate for ages 10 and up is twice the US average, alcohol-related deaths are nearly four times higher than the national rate, and teen birth rates are three times the US average. Average life expectancy in McKinley is 74 years, four years less than the typical US life span.\n\nWithout Medicaid covering doctor visits and substance abuse treatment, the situation would likely be worse, said Larry Curley, director of program development for Rehoboth McKinley.\n\nThis kind of care doesn't come cheap. The federal government paid the full cost of the expansion through 2016, but now New Mexico and other states have to pick up a 5% share. To deal with rising costs, the state in 2017 began cutting the fees it pays hospitals, doctors and other providers.\n\nAsked about her Medicaid health plan while at a popular doughnut shop, Corrine Rosales, 60, of Gallup, said it's invaluable for her and her two young nieces, Mya and Destiny. Medicaid pays for her diabetes medications and helped Mya get treated for attention-deficit disorder.\n\n\"I don't know what we would do without it,\" she said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

That would allow employers to keep some tip money for themselves, as long as each worker made at least the full federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\nWorkers' rights groups argued the rule change would lower the pay of those who work at restaurants, hotels and bars. Opponents of the rule held splashy public protests. The Labor Department received more than 218,000 mostly negative comments on the proposal.\n\nIt appeared to have worked. The spending bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday, includes a section that makes it clear that employers may not pocket any portion of tips that diners leave for workers.\n\n\"We beat them,\" said Saru Jayaraman, president of the nonprofit Restaurant Opportunities Center. \"I think they realized how outrageous what they were proposing sounded to the public, and basically they backed down.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the restaurant industry, however, are also pleased.\n\nRelated: How this Supreme Court case could impact workers' rights\n\nThe National Restaurant Association said it never asked for employers to be allowed to keep tips in the first place. Angelo Amador, senior VP at the trade group, argued that most employers wouldn't skim tips even if they were allowed to.\n\n\"A decision by a restaurant to retain some or all of the customer tips rather than distributing them to the hourly staff would be unpopular with employees and guests alike, and it could severely damage the public's perception of the restaurant,\" Amador wrote in his comment on the proposed rule.\n\nThe left-leaning Economic Policy Institute disagreed, saying that many employers take a portion of tips even in places where it's forbidden, and would do so even more often if it were legal. In a recent report, it estimated that servers would lose some $5.8 billion in tips annually to their employers.\n\nThe language in the spending bill also effectively does another big thing: It allows employers to pool tips and distribute them among staff, as long as the employer also pays the full minimum wage. Many owners have long sought to boost the pay of kitchen workers and bussers by forcing servers to share their tips.\n\n\"We want to ensure that servers, bussers, dishwashers, cooks, and others who work as a team to provide great customer service in the industry have access to share in tips left by customers, as this legislation clearly allows,\" said Amador.\n\nThat's fine with labor advocates at the National Employment Law Project, who say that pooling tips is a good way to create wage equity, as long workers are paid the full minimum wage and tips aren't shared with managers or any other supervisors. \"We enthusiastically support this compromise,\" said Judy Conti, the group's director of federal affairs.\n\nRelated: For gig economy workers in these states, rights are at risk\n\nGoing forward, however, there may be less agreement between workers' rights advocates and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nCurrently, the federal minimum wage for workers who get tips is $2.13 an hour. Seven states have done away with the two tiers and made the minimum for tipped workers the same as it is for employees who earn regular wages.\n\nMany cities and states have already raised their overall minimum wages, as the federal level has remained unchanged since 2009. The question of eliminating lower tipped minimum wages will be on the ballot this year in Washington, D.C., and Michigan and New York is considering the proposal.\n\nAll of these efforts have generally come over the objections of the restaurant industry, which argues that the economy and nature of the jobs have changed.\n\n\"The minimum wage, with all due respect, is a 1938 income support system for a workforce that worked in manufacturing and agriculture,\" said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president for public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, at a panel discussion last month. \"In our workforce, we have people who drive an Uber during the day and work in restaurants at night. They have no desire to spend their entire career in an entire industry.\"\n\nSimpson later softened her stance and said that the National Restaurant Association would like to see policies such as the minimum wage and overtime thresholds be \"updated,\" not trashed entirely.", "author": ["Lydia Depillis"]}, {"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_latest/~3/d6yq7VoFs6E/index.html", "published": "2018-03-24T15:26:08", "title": "How to handle market volatility close to retirement", "text": "There's a plot of land sitting in North Carolina waiting for Robin Festa and her husband to build their retirement home.\n\nShe's hoping to retire early in three years at age 63 and head south from Connecticut to enjoy a lower cost of living. The pair have been dutifully socking away as much money as they can into their retirement accounts.\n\nShe's meticulous about their savings, tracking everything on a spreadsheet and checking the balances frequently \u2014 a task that has been enjoyable for the last few years as the market climbed to record highs.\n\nBut the stock market's recent volatility has made checking her balance a lot less fun. In one week in early February, they lost $30,000.\n\n\"I have to admit a tear slid from my eye,\" she said, referring to her balance after the Dow's worst week in two years. They were down $18,000 for February.\n\nThe couple are planning to use some of their retirement funds to build their home down South and Wall Street's recent performance has been tough on then nerves. \"When things swing wildly, it upsets the apple cart,\" said Festa, who is a legal assistant.\n\nRelated: 1 in 5 Americans are making a terrible 401(k) mistake\n\nWall Street's recent dips bring back some painful memories: in 2008, they lost about $50,000 from their retirement savings. At the time, that was a significant portion of their funds. She worries it will be harder to recover another big loss so close to retirement. Her current portfolio is 60% invested in stocks and 40% in bonds.\n\n\"It's impossible to try and time the market,\" she said. \"It's a crap shoot. To sit there and watch your money disintegrate is hard, but if you take it out and it goes up, that's not good either. It's hard.\" She hasn't made any changes yet to her investment strategy.\n\nSitting tight when Wall Street is gyrating is difficult, but financial advisers warn against making knee-jerk investment decisions.\n\n\"I jokingly say they should pass a law that no one can look at their portfolio,\" said Jim Saulnier, a certified financial planner in Fort Collins, Colorado. \"People use short term information to make long-term decisions, and that is bad.\"\n\nBut now is a good time to evaluate your asset allocation. You might have intended to be 60/40 stocks and bonds, but Wall Street's run-up could have tilted the favor more toward stocks, noted Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\n\"The equities markets have been outperforming the bonds, overtime they grow more, so what was 60/40 might be closer to 70/30,\" she said. \"Don't set and forget.\"\n\nRelated: 3 serious problems with the 4% retirement rule\n\nThe general rule of thumb is the closer you are to retirement, the more you favor bonds over equities. For folks five years away from retirement, T. Eric Reich, a CFP in New Jersey, recommended having about 70-80% in stocks. If leaving the workforce for good is still a decade or more away, he suggested being fully invested in equities.\n\nOne way to help stomach the swings is to use dollar cost averaging, Cheng said. This strategy means you buy a pre-determined number of shares on a set schedule \u2014 regardless of market fluctuations. By investing your money gradually, it can offer some protection from market dips.\n\nHaving enough cash on hand to avoid withdrawing funds during market dips can also be reassuring to people in or close to retirement, according to Reich. That means if you are three years away from retirement, keep one year of expenses out of the market and then increase that for every year closer to retirement you get, he explained.\n\n\"We've never had more than 16 consecutive quarters of negative returns,\" he said. \"If the market crashes the day you retire, you don't need to touch that money and can live off the cash, then in positive years I can start to replenish the three-year buffer.\"\n\nGrouping your retirement savings into different buckets and investing them accordingly can also bring peace of mind and manage risk during a market freakout, explained Saulnier.\n\nThe first bucket is the cash you will need for the first two years of retirement not including any other sources of income, like a part-time job, pension or Social Security in cash.\n\nCalculate: How much will I need for retirement?\n\nThen divide up the rest of your retirement savings into time periods of retirement. The more time you have before you need the money, the more aggressive your investment strategy, suggested Saulnier.\n\n\"The money you are going to need to spend in the first five, 10 years of retirement that needs to be put in low volatile conservative holdings, but the money for 70, 75 and 85-year-old you to spend that can still be fully invested.\"\n\nFor Festa, she is keeping a close eye on Wall Street and her retirement savings. She said if she were to lose around $100,000 she would likely take a breather from the market to preserve what they have.\n\n\"I don't want to, but I could always continue to work if we had to,\" she said.", "author": ["Kathryn Vasel"]}, {"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_latest/~3/iYz4R0pfgAc/index.html", "published": "2018-03-24T00:43:22", "title": "Cambridge Analytica claims audit will confirm it deleted Facebook data", "text": "Cambridge Analytica says it's commissioning a third-party audit to prove that it deleted the trove of data about Facebook users that has embroiled the data analytics firm in controversy.\n\nThe scandal erupted last weekend when The New York Times and UK's The Observer newspaper reported that Cambridge Analytica harvested data about more than 50 million Facebook users.\n\nThe data \"allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump's campaign in 2016,\" the Times reported.\n\nFacebook says the data in question was properly gathered a few years ago by psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who said he was using the data for academic purposes.\n\nRelated: Inside the Trump campaign's ties with Cambridge Analytica\n\nBut in 2014, it wound up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, which was working to develop techniques that could be used to influence voters and was later hired by Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the company reiterated its previous claims that it did not use any of the data during its work for Trump.\n\nThe firm also said it is \"now undertaking an independent third-party audit\" to verify to the public it complied with a Facebook request in 2015 to delete the data.\n\nCambridge Analytica's announcement came as 18 law enforcement officers in the UK searched the firm's offices in London.\n\nThe news comes three days after Cambridge Analytica suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, \"pending a full, independent investigation.\"\n\nThat decision was made public moments before Channel 4 News in the UK was due to air another report in a series of exposes about the work of the company.\n\nThe company on Friday also called the media coverage \"distressing.\"\n\n\"As anyone who is familiar with our staff and work can testify, we in no way resemble the politically-motivated and unethical company that some have sought to portray,\" a statement reads. \"Our staff are a talented, diverse and vibrant group of people.\"\n\n--CNN's Eli Watkins and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.", "author": ["Jackie Wattles", "Danielle Wiener-Bronner"]}, {"link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/money_latest/~3/Sk14FzmdQ6A/index.html", "published": "2018-03-23T23:05:22", "title": "China may target American cherries, pistachios and sparkling wine", "text": "China may target American fruit, wine and pork producers.\n\nBeijing has revealed a tentative list of 128 US exports that it may hit with tariffs to retaliate against President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nChina's list raised the possibility of 15% tariffs on American cherries, almonds, wine, ethanol and steel pipes, and 25% on pork meat and recycled aluminum.\n\nTrump announced separately Thursday that he would impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports to punish China for stealing American tech and trade secrets.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture provided CNNMoney with 2017 export values for many of those products that China would target to retaliate for the steel and aluminum tariffs.

Still, she says, users are \"pissed off.\"\n\n\"I think the user picture is a little bit mixed but it's more of a threat than tech journalists, frankly,\" Lacy said.\n\nWithin tech, too, she said, there are big risks, and a \"soft power game\" of sorts. Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, \"but if they had not done acquisitions like that... Facebook would be described as Yahoo now, because young people have already been defecting from the core desktop platform.\" With all of Facebook's recent troubles, companies could be increasingly deterred from selling to the platform.\n\nIt also doesn't help that some of Silicon Valley's most influential figures are publicly shaming Facebook. WhatsApp founder Brian Acton joined the call to #deleteFacebook and early Facebook investor Sean Parker said the platform was designed to be \"addictive.\" \"I mean, people who built these things are describing it like smoking,\" Lacy said.\n\nBut this isn't the first time Facebook's dealt with controversy. When the News Feed rolled out years ago, users were \"furious\" that their updates were automatically broadcast to everyone, Lacy said.\n\n\"I think that was the only period of time I have seen people at Facebook be scared, because this was a point where they were much more vulnerable,\" she said.\n\nBut Zuckerberg apologized at the time, and the company was able to bounce back.\n\n\"It is literally the same thing [as now],\" Lacy said. \"So why are they still doing this like 15 years later?

If passed, the bill will pave the way for broad deployment of self-driving cars on US roads.\n\nConsumer advocates warned this month that the bill fails to prohibit forced arbitration clauses in terms of service agreements between autonomous vehicles manufacturers and the consumers that ride in them.

It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle.

N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, -1.51% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. HCP, -1.42% , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, -1.77% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -1.89% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -1.26% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, -2.89% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, -2.10% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, -1.74% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, -1.95% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +0.26% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -1.01% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +2.19% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +0.48% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, -1.66% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, -1.31% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, -2.44% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T11:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T12:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.77% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, -2.10% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 The biggest mistake investors will make in 2013 will be to reduce their equity positions in favor of either cash or bonds.\n\nThat, at least, was the consensus of a panel of top-performing advisers assembled Thursday at the World Money Show in Orlando. The show\u2019s sponsor, InterShow, had asked me to be the moderator.\n\nThe four panelists were chosen because each had a high ranking in the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s performance ratings: Douglas Gerlach, editor of Investor Advisory Service; Jim Lowell, editor of several advisory services, including Fidelity Investor and ETF Trader; Louis Navellier, editor of several advisory services, including Blue Chip Growth Letter and Emerging Growth Letter; and Roger Conrad, editor of Utility Forecaster. (Click here to view a video of the panel.)\n\nThe focus of the discussion was the \u201c5 Biggest Mistakes To Avoid in 2013.\u201d Here\u2019s my take on the consensus that emerged:\n\nMistake #1: Giving up on the stock market. The panelists were unanimous in advising investors not to shift assets out of equities into fixed-income. Investors who buy bonds right now are locking in negative inflation-adjusted returns, for example. \u201cDon\u2019t let fear dominate your investment decision making,\u201d one panelist urged.\n\nMistake #2: Betting on the overall stock market. Calling this a mistake might seem odd, given Mistake #1. But a number of panelists believe that the stock market advance this year will become increasingly narrow \u2014 becoming a market of stocks rather than a monolithic stock market. Profiting in the stock market will therefore require us to be more and more selective in our investments.\n\nMistake #3: Overweighting aggressive stocks. All the panelists emphasized the need to focus primarily on conservative stocks. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean buying stocks that pay high dividends, though it might. It also means buying stocks that have good fundamentals, a solid business model, a fairly predictable and consistent earnings stream, and are trading for relatively low valuations.\n\nMistake #4: Paying too much attention to politics. The panelists were united that good-quality companies are able to adapt to whatever the political environment may be in Washington. Finding and investing in them should be our focus, rather than trying to predict the outcome of our inscrutable political process. As one panelist put it: \u201cDon\u2019t let a politician tell you what to do in your portfolio.\u201d\n\nMistake #5: Being a dumb trader. The panelists had a number of examples of this kind of mistake. One is setting stop-losses that are too close. That\u2019s because of high-frequency trading, which makes it more likely than ever that such stops will be needlessly \u2014 and expensively \u2014 triggered. Another example is trading too actively in less-liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs), something guaranteed to make the marketmakers rich. \u201cYou\u2019d be shocked how much money Wall Street makes\u201d from the frequent trading of ETFs, one panelist argued.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/d_g2a4o0szM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-31T05:11:22", "title": "Is Facebook growing fast enough?", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, -3.34% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, -2.62%\n\nThe rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nGetty Images Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

What kind of a person doesn\u2019t have a Facebook account?\n\nDon\u2019t miss: What Zuckerberg didn\u2019t say: You risk more than your data on Facebook\n\nSure, people use Facebook to network and log into their Tinder IAC, +0.08% account. Those left behind often take it personally, and may even have formed a co-dependent relationship with their Facebook friends, said Simon Rego, chief psychologist and Montefiore Medical Center in New York. People either send messages asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d or, even worse, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d\n\nDeleting your account is like breaking up with all of your friends\n\n\u201cWhen you step away, you\u2019re breaking up with everyone in your network,\u201d he said. \u201cBreakups don\u2019t normally end on a good note. It\u2019s rarely that both parties agree pleasantly that things aren\u2019t working. People notice the absence and they want an explanation. They might be prone to wonder if you\u2019re OK or if they\u2019re OK. Is it something about you or is it something about me?\u201d\n\nFacebook is that bar from \u2018Cheers\u2019 where everyone knows your name.\n\nFacebook is that bar from \u201cCheers\u201d or a virtual town where everyone knows your name. Why would you go somewhere else or move to LinkedIn or WhatsApp? \u201cThe primary motivation to be on Facebook is to reap the benefits of huge amounts of positive affirmation,\u201d said Fran Walfish, a psychotherapist and author in Beverly Hills. The opposite of that, she said, is rejection.\n\nAlso see: Lonely people share too much on Facebook\n\n\u201cFolks reach out to inquire where you are, what\u2019s wrong, whether you\u2019re depressed, or if you\u2019ve done something to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThese cult-like members can be compared to kids who, when they don\u2019t feel satisfied with a tablespoon of mom\u2019s good attention, misbehave negatively in order to sustain mom\u2019s attention. In other words, any attention is better than none, even if it\u2019s negative.\u201d\n\nDeactivating attracts a lot of attention, albeit negative\n\nMany people temporarily deactivate their profile \u2014 so their data remains online \u2014 rather than delete it, Walfish said. Aside from the time associated with downloading and storing photographs, deactivation seems less harsh. \u201cDeactivating also attracts a lot of attention, albeit negative,\u201d she said. And for those who want to make a public statement, that attention is not exactly unwelcome.\n\nQuitters are more likely to be men with an average age of 31.\n\nAround one-third of Facebook users take breaks from their accounts, according to interviews of 410 current and former Facebook users carried out by researchers at Cornell University. Deactivation merely hides the account from Facebook friends, but the site retains all the data. (Facebook was not immediately available for comment.)\n\nAlso see: Facebook blocks, then allows \u2018Daily News\u2019 column about Cynthia Nixon\n\nFacebook quitters are more likely to be men (71%), concerned about privacy and older (with an average age of 31 for quitters), according to a survey of 321 Facebook users and 310 Facebook quitters carried out by the University of Vienna and published in the journal \u201cCyberpsychology, Behavior and Social Networking.\u201d\n\nPrivacy violations feel less real than, say, an outbreak of E.coli\n\nThe recent revelations of privacy violations hit Facebook\u2019s stock, but for consumers they are less tangible than, say, an E.coli outbreak in Chipotle CMG, -4.28% and the consequences may be harder to grasp. Privacy violations on Facebook or Equifax EFX, -1.51% don\u2019t appear to create the same fear as E.coli. The latter can obviously kill you, but the former is a concept that\u2019s more difficult to understand.\n\nPeople have a fear of missing out on stuff that happens online.\n\nRego said people have a fear of missing out on stuff that happens on Facebook. \u201cFacebook has 2.2 billion monthly active users. Imagine that as a potential big party going on,\u201d he said. FOMO for teenagers before Facebook was created in 2004 was bad enough, but missing a party on a Friday night pales in comparison to the constant hubbub on social media every single day.\n\nRead also: Take this seat on an airplane to reduce your chances of getting sick\n\nIn the 1950s, the American social psychologist Leon Festinger developed the \u201csocial comparison theory,\u201d which argues that we all have this innate drive to evaluate ourselves. \u201cWe feel good if we compare ourselves to people who may be perceived worse off than ourselves. It\u2019s a way to indirectly feel better about life. Facebook gives you that.\u201d The opposite, however, is also true.\n\nDeleting your account is like turning your back on a community\n\nBut some people desert Facebook for nobler reasons. Actors Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey said they would delete their Facebook accounts after the recent allegations that an app linked to data firm Cambridge Analytica mined information from tens of millions of members. Carrey wrote: \u201cWho are you sharing your life with? #regulatefacebook.\u201d Leoni cited \u201cunauthorized sharing\u201d of information.\n\nSocial media makes us feel that we are wanted and part of something.\n\nThe scandal forced Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into a mea culpa this week on CNN TWX, -1.79% where he apologized. \u201cThis was a major breach of trust and I\u2019m really sorry this happened,\u201d he said. Zuckerberg said the company will review thousands of apps and create a tool for people to find out if details about their lives was shared by an app without their knowledge.\n\n\u201cI think it is a bridge too far to say it is a cult like atmosphere,\u201d said Sherry Turkle, a professor in the Program in Science, Technology and Society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt is a place where we have become accustomed to sharing our lives, to checking in with friends, to seeing that we are wanted, a part of things, part of a group, thought of.\u201d It is, she said, a community.\n\nPeople are now reliant on Facebook, she said. \u201cSo before we just delete, we might want to see if as activist consumers and citizens, we can think about fixing social media.\u201d", "author": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B88EE902E-1C87-11E8-AAE9-A43C5E6F97B5%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2018-03-25T15:19:11", "title": "Beware, the IRS is looking for these red flags this tax season", "text": "Filing taxes can be complicated, but a simple mistake or a slight exaggeration could warrant an audit from the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nHere\u2019s how someone is chosen for an audit: An IRS software program may randomly select the taxpayer and compare the return to other similar returns to detect any anomalies, or the taxpayer in question may be linked to a family member or business partner who is being audited.\n\nAlso see: The tipping point: When to use tax software instead of seeing a professional\n\nThe IRS can audit returns up to three years old. Inaccuracies could lead to penalty charges: 20% of the disallowed amount for filing an \u201cerroneous claim for a refund or credit,\u201d the IRS stated, or $5,000 if the tax return was deemed \u201cfrivolous,\u201d where there isn\u2019t enough information to assess correct or incorrect information.\n\nIn more serious cases, taxpayers could also be brought to trial and face criminal charges of tax evasion or fraud.\n\nAnd now for the good news: The IRS audited less than 1% of returns last year, and that number may be even lower this year, said Joy Taylor, a tax expert at personal-finance site Kiplinger. Does that mean you should be carefree about filing? No.\n\nHere are red flags tax experts say you should avoid:\n\nTurning into the most generous person in America\n\nOne of the most common reasons for an audit is when the taxpayer is taking higher-than-average deductions in relation to his income. This can come from various types of deductions: Charitable contributions, real estate interest or student loans interest.\n\nThe IRS has a sense of what\u2019s a fair amount of deductions based on income brackets, Taylor said, and if someone blows past that threshold, it could lead to an audit. If someone earned $120,000 and claimed $50,000 of charitable contributions, they\u2019d smell a rat.\n\nIf you are that generous, have the proof ready in case of an audit. Many legitimate charities give receipts to donors, so keep them safely stored.\n\nClaiming a loss from your beloved hobby\n\nThis is for all the side hustlers. Know the difference between a business and a hobby. The IRS allows hobby deductions for expenses, up to the amount of income generated by that hobby. Say the taxpayer is a knitter. That person might sell some scarves and hats on the side of her everyday business, but could only claim a deduction for the expense up to the amount she earned.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: These financial tips from the \u2018sports tax man\u2019 can up your money game\n\nWithdrawing from a retirement account early\n\nThere are some scenarios where an individual is allowed to take withdrawals from a retirement account prior to 59 \u00bd years old \u2014 when, for example, the taxpayer uses a portion of that money for a first-time home, qualified education expenses or emergency medical costs.\n\nBut the IRS charges a 10% penalty (on top of the tax paid on the withdrawal) when none of those exceptions are met. Almost 40% of taxpayers did not report the withdrawal when they did not qualify for the exceptions, according to Kiplinger, but the IRS still knows the withdrawal was made.\n\nThe IRS is notified of taxable early withdrawals from an individual retirement, according to personal-finance site The Nest, and the government\u2019s system will likely notice if the taxpayer did not include it in reportable income.\n\nA sudden avalanche of business expenses\n\nThough this particular rule is going to change next year, it still applies for last year\u2019s taxes, which must be filed by April 17. In previous years, employers were allowed to deduct more than 2% of their adjusted gross income for unreimbursed employee expenses, but will no longer be allowed to do so in 2018.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should try to squeeze in as many potentially reimbursable expenses as you can for your returns this year. Employees should keep note of their expenses and use a credit card or submit an expense report, said Harvey Bezozi, founder and adviser at \u201cYour Financial Wizard.\u201d\n\nIf, for instance, you suddenly have a thick wad of restaurant and Uber receipts for business trips all over the city at night, the IRS will notice.

The average number of contacts is greatest for those in aisle seats and mid-cabin seats, the latest Emory study found, less so in middle seats, and least in window seats. Passengers seated mid-cabin have more contacts if they leave their seats. That all increases the risk of spreading infectious respiratory illnesses (or catching them). The 11 nearest neighbors to an infected passengers have a high probability of becoming infected, but the probability of transmission to each of the remaining passengers is quite low.\n\nWhen traveling by plane \u2014 or even when visiting a theater \u2014 there are good reasons why aisle seats are risky. These are the seats that will be touched most often by other people as they\u2019re trying to find their own, said Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. In 2008, members of a tour group experienced diarrhea and vomiting in an airplane flight from Boston to Los Angeles. Other passengers who suffered secondary infections were either sitting next to those infected \u2014 or those seated in aisle seats, according to the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n\nAlso see: There\u2019s one big reason women out-earn men in these 7 places in the U.S.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Barbara Corcoran says she\u2019s \u2018too cheap\u2019 to pay for first class\n\nSecondly, beware of coughing flight crew and say \u201cno\u201d to the ice.

The Guardian first reported the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which also collected data on the test-takers Facebook friends.\n\nFacebook said it suspended the accounts of two people who worked with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to Trump\u2019s election campaign. The biggest social media company in the world, with 2.2 billion monthly active users, said that Cambridge Analytica broke Facebook\u2019s policy on how third parties can obtain and use data and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized.\n\nData is being collected without your knowledge\n\nCongress recently repealed laws passed by the Federal Communications Commission on what data internet service providers could collect on users. In a nutshell: Your browser history could now be sold to advertisers without your consent, allowing for \u201cincredibly intrusive data-mining\u201d by companies online, said Cory Doctorow, activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for online privacy.\n\nAnalysts last year claimed that techniques of Cambridge Analytica, which claims to use data to change people\u2019s behavior, played a role in the 2016 presidential election by targeting red-state voters and deterring some blue-state voters from going to the polls, Motherboard reported. The extent to which Cambridge Analytica influenced voters has been called into question, but the research it\u2019s based on has broader implications.\n\nPolitical campaigns and companies are tracking your behavior\n\nFacebook also reportedly knows more about us than most people may realize. The company carried out research on the psychological states of teenagers and found \u201cmoments when young people need a confidence boost\u201d that could be used for advertisers, \u201cThe Australian\u201d newspaper reported in April 2017.\n\n(A Facebook spokesman told MarketWatch at the time that the study was not used to target vulnerable teenagers with advertisements, regretted that this study was carried out and said the contents of this study should not have been shared with a company.)\n\nFake news stories trended on Facebook\u2019s FB, -3.34% news feed in the run-up to the 2016 election \u2014 an issue the company has vowed to fight. In recent months, the social network deleted thousands of accounts as it fights fake news and has undertaken a major advertising effort to help users recognize and report fake news when they see it. (Users, of course, can make their likes private.)\n\nBut even real news stories can have a major effect. Both sides of the political divide used news stories to target Facebook users in different parts of the country \u2014 particularly swing states in the south and midwest \u2014 during the 2016 election, said Michael Fauscette, chief research officer at peer-to-peer business review platform G2 Crowd.\n\n\u2022 Democratic voters who were shown content about candidate Hillary Clinton being ahead in the polls, for instance, may have become complacent and less likely to vote.\n\n\u2022 After you \u201clike\u201d just 10 Facebook pages, advertisers (or political campaigns) can get to know you as well as a colleague, according to research from Cambridge University in the U.K.\n\n\u2022 After 70 \u201clikes\u201d as much can be deduced about you as a close friend knows. And after 150 \u201clikes\u201d? You\u2019ve essentially given up as much about yourself as your parents know.\n\nResearchers say Facebook profiles can be used to influence users\u2019 shopping and voting habits.\n\nParticipants were analyzed through \u201cBig Five\u201d \u2014 a well-known system based on five traits developed by two psychologists in the 1980s to categorize personalities. These include extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and whether or not you are open to new experiences.\n\n\u2022 Michal Kosinski, a data scientist who developed these models, said his 2012 analysis of 58,000 volunteers using Facebook predicted a user\u2019s skin color with 95% accuracy. He worked with fellow Cambridge University student David Stillwell to create a Facebook psychological traits quiz.\n\n\u2022 Developed in part by Kosinski during his fellowship at the Psychometrics Centre of Cambridge University in 2008, this model also predicted sexual orientation with 88% accuracy, and political affiliation with 85% accuracy.\n\nSoon, thousands of Facebook users had taken the quiz, eager to learn their psychological profile, and Kosinski and Stillwell had \u2014 almost inadvertently \u2014 aggregated the largest existing network of psychometric data paired with Facebook likes.\n\n\u2022 Advertisers once thought consumers would become desensitized to this lack of privacy, but studies show the opposite appears to be happening.\n\n\u2022 In 2012, 68% of those surveyed by Pew Research Center viewed targeted ads negatively and 59% have noticed this kind of targeting.\n\nFrom the richness of consumer data and behavior accessible on public profiles on Facebook, they could make predictions more comprehensively and efficiently than any survey before. In the past, to learn about someone\u2019s personality, a quiz might ask them \u201cAre you extroverted?\u201d\n\nNow, online behavior monitored by Facebook answers the question better than they themselves can \u2014 if they frequently RSVP to events or interact with others on comment threads, for example, they\u2019re more likely to be more social.\n\nOur \u2018digital footprint\u2019 can help us too\n\nDespite the recent controversies involving \u201cfake news\u201d and how people may be targeted by marketers and political campaigns, Vesselin Popov, business development director for Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre, said these tools were created to \u201caccess a history of behavior that might be more accurate than a survey\u201d \u2014 and that isn\u2019t always a bad thing. They have potentially life-saving applications in public health \u2014 in campaigns to convince citizens to quit smoking or buckle their seat belts, for example.\n\nMany people don\u2019t mind being targeted with more relevant information \u2014 but feel cheated when it\u2019s done without their knowledge.\n\nAnd as the number of companies that collect our data grows, so too do the tools to fight them. There are many ad-blockers, anti-tracking tools and VPNs (virtual private network service providers) on the market.\n\nAnd there are tools to help the average consumer track what\u2019s being collected about them. Regina Flores Mir co-founded a website called Data Selfie with fellow New York University graduate student Hang Do Thi Duc, which uses the Cambridge \u201cspecial sauce\u201d formula to allow Facebook users to see what data is being collected about them.\n\nKosinski noted that many people don\u2019t mind being targeted with more relevant information \u2014 but feel cheated when it\u2019s done without their knowledge. He said it\u2019s very difficult to regulate for several reasons: The borderless nature of the internet and the ephemeral nature of personal data. When a car or money is stolen, the evidence is clear \u2014 but data is harder to prove, and once it\u2019s in the hands of a company, nearly impossible to get back or erase. (Most online retailers and social networks make clear in their privacy policies that user data is aggregated and will remain anonymous.)\n\nDoctorow, the activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for privacy, said it is time to put legal framework in place to give back more power \u2014 and information \u2014 to consumers.\n\nIn one such case, the EFF could force companies like Facebook to let users breach terms and conditions and set up multiple accounts with fake profiles, allowing them to run their own tests on exactly how news feeds work and companies target them.

I\u2019m sorry to hear that it has come to this. Or that it might come to this. You\u2019re correct. Inheritance is not considered marital property in Ohio, so the only way for it to become part of your community property would be to commingle it in some way. That would, in theory, include renovations on a home or paying off a mortgage. Your husband could still prove that the money came directly from his inheritance, assuming he had a good lawyer.\n\nIn that case, the judge would deem the inheritance as separate property. There are many divorce cases in Ohio that have quoted this salient piece of the law: \u201cThe commingling of separate property with other property of any type does not destroy the identity of the separate property as separate property, except when the separate property is not traceable.\u201d So proceed with caution, if you intend on staying in a marriage for financial reasons, particularly if it is an unhappy one.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: My father left his home to his kids \u2014 my stepmother sold it for $1 million\n\nI offer up this juicy story: In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. She didn\u2019t tell her husband about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out all about it and sued her. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled did not appreciate her shenanigans and awarded her husband all of her winnings. If a judge suspected you were planning to divorce when your husband made these payments, your plan could also backfire. Any good divorce lawyer would balk if he saw such payments prior to a divorce.\n\nAlso read: Will my brother\u2019s $300,000 debt to our mother die with her?\n\nNot everyone agrees that your husband paying off your mortgage is a problem. \u201cIt will likely be water under the bridge, unless he could really prove you orchestrated the depletion of his separate property,\u201d says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer and author of \u201cDivorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future.\u201d Kessler doesn\u2019t advise against it. \u201cYou\u2019d be in a better position than if the money was still in his separate account.\u201d Again, my caveat: It may not go your way.\n\nIntention counts as much as timing. Your husband might be the nicest guy in the world. Or he may be someone who has treated you very badly over the years. You may have given up years of peak earning potential to raise a family. Or, perhaps, you have both had your fair share of good and bad behavior. I will refrain from judging, given that I don\u2019t know the circumstances, and leave the soul-searching up to you.

Locations will close once all inventory, fixtures and equipment are sold. The inventory alone is worth more than $2 billion, the company said.\n\nThe good deals won\u2019t come immediately\n\nThe deepest discounts will take weeks, or months. \u201cBy nature, liquidation sales don\u2019t translate to awesome deals,\u201d said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst at personal finance site DealNews.com. First, the retailer will likely bring product prices up to manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, and then apply a discount, and that means non-notable savings in the beginning, she said.\n\nSee also: Charles Lazarus, founder of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, dies at 94\n\nBut go early if you want to snag popular toys\n\nDiscounts usually start around 13% and can go as high as 80%, Ramhold said. If you\u2019re shopping for a particularly coveted item, like LEGO sets, Barbies or Star Wars merchandise, the earlier the visit to the store, the better. Those toys will go quickly, even if shoppers don\u2019t see much of a sale, Ramhold said. Parents will rush to get their children those toys for even a few dollars off, and others might take this time to do a little early holiday shopping.\n\nToys are like commodities, said Brett Rose, chief executive office of wholesale distributor United National Consumer Suppliers. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s hot,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s smaller savings, any savings helps, especially when you have kids.\u201d If it\u2019s like Sports Authority when that retailer went out of business, deals will gradually increase, he said. But keep in mind, Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us locations may already be low on merchandise from not updating its inventory recently and because some vendors have already cut ties with the company, Ramhold said.\n\nCheck out the competition\n\nDon\u2019t forget about other retailers, like Walmart WMT, -1.97% Target TGT, -1.47% and AMZN, -3.19% Because toy prices at Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us will be marked up before they\u2019re discounted, other companies may start running deals on items around the same time. Before heading to the store (Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us\u2019s website isn\u2019t showing any sales yet), look on other retailers sites\u2019 to compare prices, Ramhold said. \u201cWithout an initial markup, they could be cheaper at those stores rather than at Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d she said. \u201cConsidering other retailers will also likely allow returns for those items, it makes sense to shop elsewhere when you can.\u201d\n\nOther important information to know before shopping at Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us or Babies \u2018R\u2019 Us:\n\n\u2022 Customers can no longer use coupons, nor can they continue to earn loyalty rewards.

Still, more than half of the district's registered voters are unaffiliated.\n\nOhio's 12th District, like Pennsylvania's 18th, is better educated, wealthier and has a lower jobless rate than the median congressional district, according to U.S. Census data. A higher proportion of voters in Ohio's 12th District have college or post-graduate degrees than voters in Pennsylvania's 18th District do, and the median household income there is higher.\n\nCrowded fields on both the Republican and Democratic sides are vying for the seat. Republican candidates include state Sens. Troy Balderson and Kevin Bacon.

Having to go through a primary process could make that more difficult for a Democrat in Ohio than it was for Lamb, said Mark Weaver, a Republican strategist at the Columbus-based Communications Counsel.\n\nTo win a primary election, candidates often have to go closer to their party's extremes. It can make them less appealing to general election voters.\n\nRepublicans have argued Lamb had an easier path than other candidates will this year because he did not face a primary election. It allowed him to take moderate stances that would not have held up had he gone through a primary, they contend.\n\n\"Most Democratic primaries won't produce a former Marine, former prosecutor, good-looking white guy who loves to shoot AR-15s and who says he's personally pro-life and wants to toss out Nancy Pelosi,\" said Weaver, who is working as a consultant for the GOP candidate Bacon and has worked with Balderson in the past.\n\nOf course, the primary election concerns go both ways. Weaver says the risk for Republicans in the district is nominating someone whose views skew too far to the right \"who cannot win a general election.\"\n\nThat may prove particularly important in Ohio's 12th District, where voters are more educated than the median congressional district.

However, one market watcher says the Fed's slow pace borders on ridiculous.\n\n\"It's at such a glacial pace, it's hilarious,\" Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager of fixed income at Sit Investment Associates, told CNBC's \"Futures Now\" recently. \"It's almost like arguing who can whisper the loudest.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the central bank announced a 25-basis-point increase to the fed funds rate. Its target range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent is still below pre-recession levels, a level that Doty derided.\n\n\"It's not really getting them to where they want to be,\" Doty continued. \"They want to be at a neutral rate which is 3 percent and they're at a pace that's going to take them as long as two years to get there. It seems a little silly.\"\n\nThe Fed has been working to normalize monetary policy over the past two years, beginning with its initial move off historically low, near-zero rates in December 2015. Since then, it has raised rates in incremental 25-basis-point moves, and begun to slowly wind down a balance sheet that exceeds $4 trillion.\n\nBy the Fed's own testimony, the U.S. economy is strong and the labor market tight, two conditions that do not warrant stimulative policy, Doty aid. In a statement Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues said that the economic outlook had \"strengthened in recent months\" and that activity should expand at a \"moderate pace.\"\n\nIn updated forecasts, the Fed said it expects the U.S. economy to grow at a 2.7 percent rate in 2018, 2.4 percent in 2019, and 2 percent in 2020. Each year's forecasts were revised higher.\n\n\"It's surprising that their GDP forecast is about the same as what our growth rate was in 2014, 2015,\" said Doty. \"Yet we're in a completely different environment and they described it as such as employment's strong and a lot of tailwinds. So, to us as a bond manager, that means rates are going up.\"\n\nInflation \u2013 one of the Fed's dual mandates \u2013 has been a major hurdle to a faster pace of hiking rates. Prices have been slow to rise, and wage growth stagnant for several years, though both began to show signs of life in recent months.\n\nIf the Fed doesn't fasten its pace, those inflation pressures could accelerate and cause an economic headache, Doty added.\n\n\"If they don't raise rates by enough then you have the inflation fears that might rear their ugly head. I believe that if the Fed is too glacial, too slow, the bond market vigilantes \u2026 will just take over and start to push rates up higher on their own,\" he said.\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury bond is hovering near its highest levels in four years.

The bracket-busting continued, with #9-seeded Florida State defeating #4 seed Gonzaga, #9-seed Kansas State defeating #5 seed Kentucky, and #11-seed Loyola-Chicago defeated #7-seed Nevada. Number 2 Duke managed to break the upset streak on Friday by staving off a resurgent Syracuse, narrowly avoiding being sent home by the number 11 seed.\n\nTicketIQ said that, as of Thursday, fewer seats than normal were available for regional games. That limited availability has boosted prices slightly since the tournament began, with the average price for a regional round ticket being $432, less than last year's $465.\n\nThat average price is inflated by Omaha, where regional prices have gone up since the start of the tournament by 34 percent, and average $586. The increase may be attributed to Kansas' close proximity to Omaha, where excited fans are spurring demand and prices.\n\nBoston hosts four teams seeded at #5 or lower, and prices there have fallen by 29 percent to $316. Prices for Atlanta and Los Angeles games haven't budged much.\n\nAt the beginning of the tournament, costs to attend the Final Four in San Antonio were the lowest in four years, at $730. The prices have increased to $903, according to TicketIQ's data which includes listings from the Official NCAA Ticket Exchange, all despite the number of upsets.\n\nTo be certain, ticket demand and affordability are influenced by a multitude of factors like region and the intensity of a fan base. And despite the number of upsets this year, prices for the Final Four have been on the rise.\n\nHowever, recent history suggests that fans get less interested \u2014 and tickets get comparatively cheaper\u2014 when top teams get knocked out.\n\nIf the past is any prologue, the number of upsets may prove helpful for fans in search of cheap Final Four tickets. Back in 2011, when lower-seeded teams advancing were fairly common, the ticket price to see the last 4 remaining teams tumbled to $552 \u2014 the lowest ever.\n\nConversely, there weren't nearly as many upsets last year, and fans literally paid the price. Ticket prices skyrocketed by a staggering 83 percent throughout the tournament, which ultimately produced two #1 seeds (North Carolina and Gonzaga) facing off against each other. The Final Four contest produced the most expensive ticket price ever at $1,343, according to TicketIQ.\n\nNonetheless, fans will have to dig into their pockets for this weekend's games at the very least.

Think, for instance, of when policymakers had indicated a 6.5 percent unemployment rate would be the basis for policy tightening, only to watch that level come and go without any action.\n\nThere was some of that on Wednesday as well: The Federal Open Market Committee indicated a slightly more hawkish bent despite essentially no change in its collective inflation forecast. That suggests a continued adherence to the Phillips curve, which posits that as unemployment declines, inflation should rise, a phenomenon that has not occurred during the economic recovery.\n\nHowever, the market was tuned in more to Powell's words. He indicated, in a comparatively short 43-minute news conference, that he has limited interest in forecasting, or central bank verbosity.\n\n\"The committee made one decision, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points,\" Powell said during his first news conference, in response to a question about the \"dot-plot\" forecasts for interest rates from individual FOMC members.\n\nThe indication was clear: This is what we decided today, and it has little bearing on what happens tomorrow.\n\n\"That was Powell's most powerful sentence in the entire press conference,\" Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in his daily market note. \"The underlying message was one of process: Chair Powell made it clear that he is intellectually open to new information and will not be anchored by a 'Dot,' even if it is his own.\"\n\nThat's not to say the dots aren't important. The dot plot produced from the March meeting indicated that despite the lack of inflation pressures, the Powell Fed at this point looks to be at least marginally more aggressive with rate hike plans than the Janet Yellen Fed.\n\nWhile the baseline forecast remains three rate hikes in 2018, excluding dots submitted by nonvoting members pushes that expectation into four moves for this year and perhaps more in the next two years.\n\nThe market is sensitive to a tighter Fed, as evidenced by the day-after market sell-off Thursday. The selling may have been rooted more in trade war fears, but nevertheless served as a cold reception to the market's first look at Powell in his new role.\n\n\"Our main takeaway is that the committee's views are evolving in line with the data and financial conditions,\" Goldman Sachs economists Spencer Hill and Jan Hatzius said in a note. \"We would not rule out a faster pace in 2019 or continued increases into 2020, and we view the risks to our interest rate forecasts as broadly balanced.\"\n\nFor investors, it all means getting used to a new day in U.S. monetary policy, even if the differences at first are subtle.\n\n\"A policy shift is under way at the Federal Reserve,\" said Ryan Sweet, director of monetary policy research at Moody's Analytics. \"While the Fed didn't signal a fourth rate hike this year, that change is coming.\"\n\nWATCH: Powell says he's been surprised by low wage growth.", "author": ["Jeff Cox", "Andrew Harrer", "Bloomberg", "Getty Images"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/financial-markets-are-not-ready-for-a-dangerous-trade-war.html", "published": "2018-03-22T16:02:00", "title": "Financial markets are not ready for a 'dangerous' trade war", "text": "Worry about the Trump administration kicking off a global trade war sent stocks sharply lower, and investors sought safety in bonds.\n\nOther factors were also weighing on markets, including some concern in the bond market that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday were not quite as hawkish as the central bank's new economic and interest rate forecasts would suggest. Stocks, on the other hand, focused more on the forecast and the need to adjust for a period of higher rates.\n\nStocks were also under pressure from a sell-off in tech, as Facebook continued to slide and the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF, which represents the Nasdaq 100, was trading below its 50-day moving average, after breaking that level briefly on Monday.\n\n\"The equity markets have not parsed the potential for a trade war. The two policies we're concerned about are monetary policy and trade policy, and trade policy is coming at us like a freight train right now. The outcome of this could be dangerous,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. Hogan also said that the stock market, even more than the bond market, is focusing on the fact that the Fed forecast includes more rate hikes than previously expected next year and the year after, though the Fed's forecast for this year is unchanged.\n\n\"Technology unfortunately led us on the way up ,and is now leading us on the way down. Unfortunately, there's nothing to take over leadership,\" he added.\n\nBut trade wars and the potential fallout on the global economy have been the overriding fears hanging over markets all week, and that's been weighing on the U.S. dollar. At midday, the Trump administration is expected to announce tariffs against China, penalizing it for the theft of U.S. intellectual property.\n\n\"The first reaction is [investors] are going to be more concerned ... they're going to worry about what China's response is. Every tit for tat just raises the whole scenario. What's getting a little lost is the Europeans seem to have gotten carved out of the metals tariffs,\" said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets.\n\nThe U.S. trade representative said Europe and other allies could potentially be exempt from the metals tariffs, in his comments before Congress on Wednesday. That puts the focus directly on China, which administration officials have said is dumping cheap aluminum and steel on the market.\n\nCanada and Mexico are also being exempted, and on the trade front, NAFTA is one hopeful spot. The Trump administration this week sought a technical extension for the talks to continue.\n\n\"We're still several steps from the point where [trade worries] starts walking the Fed back, where it hits global growth or U.S. growth. We're at the stage now where we know Trump is going to do something against China today, but what's the response? It's weighing on the market,\" said Briggs.\n\nPowell did mention tariffs Wednesday, but he said current policy is not impacting the outlook. But he said that a number of Fed officials reported that they spoke with business leaders, and \"trade policy has become a concern going forward for that growth.\"\n\nThe Dow opened down 250 points, and the Nasdaq was off 0.8 percent in morning trading, after initial losses of more than 1.3 percent. The 10-year yield slid to 2.81 percent, more than 12 basis points below Wednesday's level. The two-year Treasury, most sensitive to the Fed, was at 2.27 percent.\n\nThe dollar which fell sharply during Powell's briefing Wednesday remained under pressure, and was off 0.6 percent against the yen.\n\nMark McCormick, head of North America foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities, said the dollar was wobbling in response to Powell. He said the new Fed chair's approach is different than former Chair Janet Yellen, who would have defended the Fed's future forecast in a more academic style.\n\n\"He actually poured some cold water on it. ... An academic would have played up the econometric models and the forecast around it,\" McCormick said. Powell said he would have to see what happens with the economy. \"He watered it down a bit and didn't give much context to it. You had Powell kind of playing down the scenario in the back end.\"\n\nThe Fed retained its forecast for three rate hikes this year, more dovish than some expected. But in its longer-term forecasts, it upped the number of hikes in 2019 and 2020 and raised the long-run rate to 2.90 from 2.75 percent, a surprisingly hawkish move. It also raised its economic forecasts.\n\n\"The fact these longer-term forecasts were taken with a massive pinch of salt probably didn't give the dollar the outcome it needed,\" he said.", "author": ["Patti Domm", "Jonathan Ernst"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/22/how-the-feds-outlook-could-be-worrisome-for-markets.html", "published": "2018-03-22T15:59:00", "title": "How the Fed's outlook could be worrisome for markets", "text": "There's a deeper hawkish tilt to the Federal Reserve's outlook for interest rates that could be worrisome for markets.\n\nFederal Reserve officials, in their first meeting chaired by Jerome Powell, raised their median forecast for the funds rate for 2019 to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent, and for 2020 to 3.4 percent from 3.1 percent. Those are aggressive forecasts relative to market expectations.\n\nStill, they total only about an extra 30 basis points of tightening over the next two years.\n\nThe more concerning take comes by looking closely at just how many Fed officials are more hawkish than the median. It suggests the risk to the market is definitely for a more hawkish Fed over the next several years.\n\nTo be sure, that could change if the economic data come in weaker than expected, especially if inflation doesn't rise towards the Fed's 2 percent goal. But if the economy follows the current forecast, it wouldn't take much for the Fed to end up being more hawkish than its current stance.\n\nAt his first press conference as Fed chairman, Powell was peppered with questions about the forecasts, but he downplayed their significance. \"The summary of economic projections is a compilation of the individual rate forecasts,\" Powell said. \"The committee made one decision at this meeting and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The summary of economic projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down.\"\n\nThat is, forecasts are not policy, but they can suggest where the risks lie.\n\nThe Fed's projections for this year show a median forecast of 2.1 percent for the funds rate, but eight officials are above the median (more than half of the committee). Their forecasts average out to a funds rate of 2.4 percent, that is, one more hike than the median \u2014 for a total of four this year.\n\nBy contrast, just two officials forecast a funds rate below the median, suggesting the tail risk for markets is for higher, not lower, rates.\n\nThat problem continues into 2019. Five officials have a forecast at the median 2.9 percent. Four officials are below the median, but six officials are above it. The average forecast for these six officials is a much more hawkish 3.4 percent. One forecast is as high as 3.9, or 2.28 percentage points above the current rate.\n\nPut another way, 40 percent of the committee is more hawkish than the median for 2019 while just 27 percent is more dovish. And the forecasts of the doves are just barely below the median.\n\nThe risks balance out somewhat for 2020, but at a higher level. The median forecast is 3.4 percent, with five officials at the median, five below and five above. But again, the averages suggests a hawkish tilt.\n\nThe average rate of those below the median is 2.65 percent. The average forecast of those above: 3.95 percent, or 55 basis point above the median, with one official at 4.9 percent.\n\nAll of this raises questions about support for a critical line in the Fed's statement where it says: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\" It seems as if a considerable portion of the committee is less on board with \"below normal\" rates than perhaps they had been.", "author": ["Steve Liesman", "Aaron P.

I'll provide the link below so you can follow along going forward. An observation I'd like to make is that the stats in the front of the quarter have enormous sway over the GDPNow estimate because the data set is limited to just one or two stats. If the first stat of the quarter is strong, then the GDPNow will reflect that strong figure. As the quarter goes by and more stats are input into the model, the more it moderates. If the GDPNow starts the quarter with a high number and sinks into the end of the quarter, then stats are coming in weaker, which may indicate a weakening economy.\n\nThe first quarter started out strong with a GDPNow print at a high level of 5.4 percent. But after nearly a full quarter's worth of economic statistics, it is now running at a dismal 1.8 percent.\n\nOne thing missing from that 1.8 percent figure is the earnings outlook for stocks.

Was I naive'", "text": "When I first met Shahmir Sanni last August, he was nervy, anxious, uncertain. \u201cI\u2019ve just started piecing it together,\u201d he said, in what was our first off-the-record conversation. \u201cAll this stuff I didn\u2019t realise at the time.\u201d Stuff that a series of investigations and news articles had forced him to start thinking about. \u201cWas I just really naive?\u201d he asked. Then later: \u201cDo you think they just used me?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a painful question for Sanni, one that he\u2019s struggled with over a period of months. Now, though, he thinks that, yes, he was used; that he and his friend, Darren Grimes, were taken advantage of by people they respected and trusted, and that the consequences of it are profound, far reaching, and go well beyond his own personal feelings of hurt and betrayal.\n\nIn early 2016, Sanni was a 22-year-old recent graduate, volunteering with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the European Union led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a \u201cnatural Eurosceptic\u201d it was a plum role. \u201cIt was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You\u2019re given a lot of creative freedom.\u201d He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames.\n\nPlay Video 10:30 The Brexit whistleblower: 'Not cheating is the core of what it means to be British' \u2013 video\n\nVote Leave\u2019s senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. \u201cA huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cAnd we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn\u2019t appear racist.\u201d\n\nSo, it was: \u201cHere\u2019s the brown guy\u201d?\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d he says.\n\nIt was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. \u201cAt university all my friends were \u2018Remain, Remain, Remain\u2019, but when I started doing research into it, I realised I\u2019m a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this\u201d is why Sanni is talking today. Because it\u2019s what happened next that\u2019s the issue \u2013 a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave\u2019s senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May\u2019s political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave\u2019s official youth groups, BeLeave.\n\n\u201cBeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against\u2026 it totally aligned with my values.\u201d\n\nBeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave\u2019s HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. \u201cHis content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Key players in the Vote Leave campaign Show Hide Vote Leave: the key players Dominic Cummings Campaign director of Vote Leave and former special adviser to Michael Gove, the 46-year-old from Durham has been described as an \u201coptimistic Eurosceptic\u201d by the Economist. Cummings is regarded as the leading strategist of the campaign. He is credited with creating the memorable official slogan of Vote Leave: \u201ctake back control\u201d. Matthew Elliott (pictured)\n\nChief executive of Vote Leave, the 40-year-old political strategist from Leeds has been described by the BBC as \u201cone of the most effective lobbyists at Westminster\u201d. Elliott has served as chief executive of Big Brother Watch, Business for Britain and, formerly, the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance. Stephen Parkinson\n\nThe national organiser of the ground operation for Vote Leave, Parkinson is from North Shields and was a special adviser to Theresa May when she was home secretary. Following the EU referendum victory he rejoined her as a special adviser based in Downing Street. His current official title is political secretary to the prime minister. Victoria Woodcock\n\nVote Leave\u2019s operations director. Credited by Cummings with winning the referendum: he described her as \u201cthe most indispensable person in the campaign \u2013 if she\u2019d gone under a bus, Remain would have won.\u201d Vote Leave\u2019s powerful \u2018Voter Intention Collection System\u2019 (Vics) software was named after her.

Darren Grimes\n\nFormer fashion design student, 25, who ran BeLeave \u2013 the campaign group given \u00a3625,000 by Vote Leave during the final stages of the referendum. The cash was paid directly to data company AggregateIQ. The donation is currently being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Grimes is now the deputy editor of the BrexitCentral website. Boris Johnson\n\nA figurehead of Vote Leave and member of the campaign committee that met weekly during the referendum to set its campaign strategy. The 53-year-old Old Etonian is currently foreign secretary. Michael Gove\n\nCo-convener of Vote Leave\u2019s campaign committee, the 50-year-old is currently environment secretary. Previously he has served as education secretary and justice secretary.\n\nSanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, \u201cCleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThis was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave \u2013 its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWhen Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. \u201cWe were like: \u2018If we had \u00a310,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave\u2019s internal lawyer and head of compliance. \u201cAnd he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: \u2018OK, cool. How do we do that?\u2019 And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that\u2019s what he was told to do.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An example of BeLeave\u2019s campaign messaging. \u2018BeLeave was very progressive,\u2019 says Sanni. \u2018It was aimed at young, liberal Leavers.\u2019 Photograph: BeLeave\n\nThe lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account.\n\nBut no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of \u00a37m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of \u00a31m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially \u00a3400,000 but ended up close to \u00a3700,000.\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n\u201cWe were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine\u2026 you\u2019re 22 and you\u2019re given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.\u201d\n\nToday, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave\u2019s creativity and flair. \u201cVote Leave didn\u2019t really give us that money,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You\u2019re not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.\u201d\n\nTo Sanni\u2019s mind, what this means is: \u201cThey cheated.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections \u2013 which for the official designated campaign group is \u00a37m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to \u00a3700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don\u2019t co-ordinate \u2013 or, in the Electoral Commission\u2019s words, \u201cwork together\u201d.\n\nSo was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni \u2013 and he has a wealth of documents \u2013 now thinks it wasn\u2019t. He believes BeLeave \u201cworked together\u201d with Vote Leave.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.\u201d And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What\u2019s more: \u201cThey told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.\u201d The money went straight to Vote Leave\u2019s Canadian data analytics firm \u2013 AggregateIQ (AIQ).\n\nIt\u2019s an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It\u2019s been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: \u201cWhy did Vote Leave donate \u00a3625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?\u201d\n\nUntil now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. \u201cWe were two broke college students. Darren\u2019s working-class as well. And it\u2019s his name all over this. He\u2019s the one being investigated. It\u2019s his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.\u201d\n\n17 days after an investigation opened, Vote Leave's COO deleted herself and two others from over 100 files\n\nSanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn\u2019t believe in what he calls EU \u201cpassport discrimination\u201d. And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. \u201cBritain saved my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that\u2019s what I cannot stand.\u201d\n\nTo say it\u2019s a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, where Sanni works on pro-Brexit social media messaging. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for another Matthew Elliott outfit, the website BrexitCentral.\n\nSanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother \u2013 a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago \u2013 and his two sisters. But it\u2019s also part of what has prompted his decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful\u2026 this is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe first inkling that something wasn\u2019t right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave\u2019s audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was \u201ca highly unusual transfer of funds\u201d. Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of \u00a3675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day \u2013 on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June.\n\nSanni shrugged it off. \u201cI just thought: \u2018Oh, this is how politics is. It\u2019s remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shahmir Sanni and Darren Grimes canvassing for BeLeave during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Photograph: Shahmir Sanni\n\nBut Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. \u201cI\u2019ve had three journalists this morning,\u201d one says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should go back to GP and be like I\u2019m dying or just fight through it.\u201d (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he\u2019d received from a Vote Leave director: \u201cSo as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: \u2018We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: \u201cWe received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.\u201d\n\nWhat Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave\u2019s actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum.\n\nWhat\u2019s also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation \u2013 which has put him front and centre of the media coverage \u2013 has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism.\n\nWhen the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an \u201cassessment\u201d, he really started to panic. \u201cHe rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn\u2019t understand it. I said: \u2018We\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 But he was panicking. So I just did it.\u201d\n\nSanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. \u201cWe were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave\u2019s lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn\u2019t understand how we had done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It\u2019s here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave\u2019s data analytics firm, AIQ.\n\n\u201cI looked at it and I thought \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 That\u2019s when I realised things were serious. I was, \u2018OK, this is really fucked up.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted herself, Cummings and Vote Leave\u2019s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of her activity. It is not known whether or not she was acting under instruction.\n\nThis was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nTo Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss \u2013 that this was evidence that had been deleted. Woodcock had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed their names from them. Not one or two, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is \u201cfactually wrong and libellous\u201d. Vote Leave say staff acted \u201cethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do when you saw that on the drive?\u201d I ask Sanni.\n\n\u201cI told Chris,\u201d he says.\n\nA gif showing changes made to BeLeave shared drive permissions on 17 March 2017.\n\nI\u2019ve spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni\u2019s role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised.\n\nChristopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He\u2019s at the heart of Brexit too.\n\nIt was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie\u2019s work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: \u201cI was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of a March 2016 email exchange between Shahmir Sanni and Vote Leave\u2019s Stephen Parkinson. Beginning with the phrase \u201cAs Chris has already mentioned...\u201d, Sanni asks about meeting to discuss the possibility of working with the Leave campaign. Photograph: Screenshot\n\nIt is Wylie\u2019s role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn\u2019t just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and \u201cdigital advertising\u201d firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its \u00a36.8m spend.\n\nIn February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage\u2019s Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica\u2019s role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. \u201cIn my opinion, I was lying,\u201d she said. \u201dI felt like we should say \u2018this is exactly what we did\u2019.\u201d This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year.\n\nIn March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave \u2013 the official leave campaign group in the referendum \u2013 was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer\u2019s funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as \u201cSCL Canada\u201d.\n\nIt was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. \u201cIf you want to understand where Canada fits into this,\u201d an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, \u201cyou need to find Christopher Wylie.\u201d So I did.\n\nWylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ.\n\n\u201cI helped set up AIQ in 2013,\u201d he told me in our first conversation. \u201cThey\u2019re my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica\u2019s technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.\u201d\n\nJeff Silvester was Wylie\u2019s first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ\u2019s IP \u201cin perpetuity\u201d. This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What\u2019s more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. \u201cAIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.\u201d In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: \u201cAggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ\u2019s work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica\u2019s vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. \u201cBannon was always interested in Brexit,\u201d says Wylie. \u201cHe saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An excerpt from the Electoral Commission\u2019s November 2017 review of assessments into the \u201cpotential incorrect reporting of joint referendum spending\u201d.\n\nIn total, \u00a33.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only \u201cwork together\u201d if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent \u00a32,697,000. There was the \u00a3675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of \u00a3100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received \u00a332,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of \u201cpersuadables\u201d in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThese four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away.\n\nIn April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm \u201con the internet\u201d. Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ\u2019s website didn\u2019t show up in Google searches until after the referendum. \u201cI looked at the time,\u201d says Sanni. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Who is AIQ?\u2019 And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete.\n\nNobody is in any doubt about Cummings\u2019s brilliance: he\u2019s advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog \u2013 about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave\u2019s ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. \u201cA small enough margin,\u201d he notes, that \u201ca few specific events and decisions\u201d made all the difference.\n\nHe\u2019s also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm\u2019s website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\u201d This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that \u201cthe services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave\u201d, and \u201cthe services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave\u201d.\n\nThe final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period \u201cWaterloo\u201d and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as \u201cpersuadable\u201d with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings\u2019s campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There\u2019s no doubt that he won the war of the internet.\n\nBut the question about this donation, the \u00a3675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ\u2019s links to Cambridge Analytica\u2026 all this has dogged the result for 18 months now.\n\nPlay Video 0:30 Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings: \u2018We basically dumped the entire budget in the last 10 days\u2019 \u2013 video\n\nLast autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project\u2019s Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, it said, \u201cto suspect an offence may have been committed.\u201d\n\nCummings masterminded Vote Leave\u2019s strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, \u201cIt\u2019s Darren\u2019s name all over everything. He\u2019s the one in the frame.\u201d And he\u2019s the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that\u2019s followed.\n\nThis is the heart of the story, and it\u2019s what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record.\n\n\u201cDarren is totally loyal,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they knew that.\u201d\n\nAnd it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the impact on Darren\u2019s health that made me go: \u2018Something\u2019s fucked up. Something\u2019s wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cI was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh [\u2026] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Gove and Darren Grimes (back left) in BeLeave campaign material. Photograph: BeLeave\n\nSanni: \u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d\n\nGrimes: \u201cManaging accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.\u201d\n\nSanni: \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you\u2019re worried because you care \u2013 which is good thing\u2026 And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave\u2019s lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: \u201c\u2026 Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don\u2019t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave\u2019s senior director and Vote Leave\u2019s head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: \u201cI absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.\u201d She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have \u201cany kind of control\u201d over them.\n\nThere\u2019s a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has \u2013 between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave\u2019s messages and beliefs (\u201cBeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,\u201d read the funding proposal document they submitted).\n\n\u2018I made Steve Bannon\u2019s psychological warfare tool\u2019: meet the data war whistleblower Read more\n\nAnd Grimes\u2019s fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn\u2019t feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, \u201cyou should be proud\u201d, and Grimes replies: \u201cI guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it\u2019ll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.\u201d We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were \u201cdamaging\u201d and \u201cuntrue\u201d.\n\nWhat has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn\u2019t see him going on record. He\u2019s a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to.\n\n\u201cEveryone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody congratulated us and knew what role we\u2019d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we\u2019d been. He\u2019s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.\u201d\n\nAnd part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie\u2019s decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he\u2019d expose himself to risks he hadn\u2019t properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn\u2019t really understand the possible consequences. But what I\u2019ve learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he\u2019s been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he\u2019s been of Darren Grimes. They\u2019re at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too.\n\n\u201cI think I respect British laws more than most British people do,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I\u2019ve seen\u2026 the safety that it\u2019s brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.\u201d\n\nSanni doesn\u2019t go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has \u201chad a lot of trauma in my life\u201d. Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement.\n\n\u201cThis is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It\u2019s what it means to be British.\u201d\n\nSanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. \u201cWe don\u2019t cheat,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re British.\u201d\n\nWhat will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave\u2019s CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. \u201cGo to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.\u201d\n\nLike us all.", "author": ["Carole Cadwalladr", "Antonio Olmos"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/25/facebook-logs-texts-and-calls-users-find-as-they-delete-accounts-cambridge-analytica", "published": "2018-03-25T16:17:06", "title": "Facebook logs texts and calls, users find as they delete accounts", "text": "As users continue to delete their Facebook accounts in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a number are discovering that the social network holds far more data about them than they expected, including complete logs of incoming and outgoing calls and SMS messages.\n\nThe #deletefacebook movement took off after the revelations that Facebook had shared with a Cambridge psychologist the personal information of 50 million users, without their explicit consent, which later ended up in the hands of the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook makes it hard for users to delete their accounts, instead pushing them towards \u201cdeactivation\u201d, which leaves all personal data on the company\u2019s servers.

We take this enormously seriously. We have been very clear that we will be coming after 100% of companies that do not comply.\u201d\n\nTell us what the gender pay gap looks like where you work Read more\n\nAround 3,700 companies have revealed their gender pay gap on the Government Equalities website, but with only 10 days before the cut-off around 5,300 are yet to do so. Hilsenrath said 25% of the 9,000 companies that by law must report their gender pay gap before the deadline had yet to register to do so.\n\n\n\nThe EHRC will immediately write to companies that do not make the deadline. Those that continue to avoid the statutory requirement could ultimately face a summary conviction, an unlimited fine and be forced to publish the data under a court order.\n\n\u201cIf that happens it will be the case that the company has been found to be in breach of the law and you won\u2019t be able to row back from the publicity of that fact once the deadline has past,\u201d said Hilsenrath.\n\nAsked whether companies would be named and shamed, Hilsenrath said: \u201cThere will be a list and this is will made public. We will be conducting a statutory investigation and that requires us as a matter of law to publish the terms of reference. So this is going to be very public and there won\u2019t be any way to hide the figures.

But when asked if she had a message for companies who had not yet filed, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s the law, don\u2019t break it \u2013 just like you wouldn\u2019t break any other law. Secondly I would say stop wasting your money talking to consultants who might be advising you about legal loopholes. It\u2019s an ill-informed and ill-judged gamble.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cBut above and beyond all of that, I would say \u2013 look at the women who work for you and ask yourself if they don\u2019t deserve a better deal. There is a huge moral element to this. We as a society know that there are legal and social implications for the fact that half the human race is responsible for giving birth for the continuation of the human race. Lots of the people running these organisations have daughters. It\u2019s not good enough.\u201d\n\nThe pay gap reporting requirement has already revealed significant discrepancies in the differences between the amount men and women get paid in industries from finance to beauty, and shone a spotlight on how men dominate the highest-earning senior roles in many companies.\n\nIn banking, HSBC\u2019s median pay gap was 29% and bonus gap 61%, Barclays International revealed a 43% pay gap and 73% bonus gap, while at Goldman Sachs the figures were 36% and 67% respectively.\n\nAt L\u2019Or\u00e9al, where 69% of the workforce are female, the figures were 32% and 35%, with men holding 70% of senior roles. In education, the Guardian\u2019s analysis of data has revealed that at a string of multi-academy trusts women face median hourly pay deficits of more than 50%, with the median gap above the national average in the majority of cases.\n\nHilsenrath said the requirement was \u201ca really important endeavour\u201d which had revealed that the UK was not doing \u201cquite as well as we thought\u201d.

But often these people are not dealt with, they are either moved to another congregation or told to keep their head down for a few years,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother victim, who did not want to be named, said she was abused by a ministerial servant (someone with congregational responsibilities) in the organisation in the 1970s.\n\nProfile Who are the Jehovah's Witnesses and how do they operate? Show Hide Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are members of a Christian religious movement. In 2017, the group reported an average global monthly membership of approximately 8.2 million people, about 137,000 of whom are in the UK. The organisation is governed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania corporation, which has its headquarters in New York. It is the main legal entity used worldwide to direct, administer and disseminate doctrines. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses base their beliefs only on the text of the Bible and ignore \u201cmere human speculations or religious creeds\u201d. Members reject what they see as the sinful values of the secular world and maintain a degree of separation from non-believers, whom they call \u201cworldly people\u201d. The congregation is served by overseers, or elders. Only men can serve in these positions and they are responsible for congregational governance, pastoral work and forming judicial committees to investigate serious sins. If a Jehovah\u2019s Witness experiences sexual abuse, they are advised to report it to the elders, who will take further action if there is a second witness to the offence or if the accused admits the abuse. The perpetrator will then be called before a judicial committee. Someone who commits a serious sin can be \u201cdisfellowshipped\u201d. This involves being shunned by the congregation, which for most members includes their immediate family.\n\n\u201cI was sexually abused many times a week from the age of three until I was 12. Congregation elders knew that when I told them, at 12, what had been happening. No steps were taken to tell the police. I had to tell three male senior figures what had happened. Imagine that? A young girl telling a bunch of men what this man did to me. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to have my mother there with me.\u201d\n\nAfter she went to the police about what had happened, the person who abused her pleaded guilty and was eventually convicted. \u201cThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses should lose their charity status as they are not protecting children,\u201d she added. She said she had mental health issues as a result of what happened and how it was dealt with.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jason Munro says he was abused for 10 years. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian\n\nJason Munro, another alleged victim of sexual abuse who waived his right to anonymity, could not give details of his case due to a current investigation but said: \u201cI am completely horrified by the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ... I didn\u2019t get support and I experienced 10 years of abuse. Elders knew in my teens about the abuse but it was never a case of \u2018let\u2019s get this person the professional help he needs\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen a Jehovah\u2019s Witness experiences sexual abuse they are supposed to report it to elders, who are always men, who will take further action if there is a second witness to the offence. The perpetrator will then be called before a judicial committee if they admit abuse or if there is a second witness.\n\n\u201cThis causes further trauma to the victim and coupled with the two-witness rule, is undoubtedly the reason that so many victims have never reported it,\u201d said Kathleen Hallisey, senior solicitor in the abuse team at Bolt Burdon Kemp, who is currently acting on behalf of 15 alleged victims.\n\nShe also noted that the problem with the two-witness rule in the context of sexual abuse was that there were rarely witnesses to it, \u201cmeaning that [these] reports ... are usually dismissed\u201d.\n\nIt has been reported that the headquarters of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the UK, the Watch Tower, holds a database of abuse allegations made within the organisation but has yet to hand it over to authorities.\n\nThe Charity Commission launched an investigation in 2013 looking into the Manchester New Moston congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, concluding that it did not deal adequately with allegations of child abuse made against one of the trustees.\n\nThe commission is still running an inquiry into the main government body of the group, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain. This is examining the child safeguarding policy and procedures further.\n\nFollowing the investigation into the Manchester New Moston congregation last year, the Watch Tower changed its policy so that victims are no longer required to confront their abuser face to face.\n\nA former elder, who was asked to investigate a child abuse case in 2007, claimed he was urged not to contact the police, although it was decided that the perpetrator should not be assigned to work with children.\n\nHowever, the then elder \u2013 who left in 2012 over how the case was handled \u2013 said that this rule was not followed by everyone and when he raised this as a concern he was told to back off.\n\n\u201cI hugely regret the fact that I wasn\u2019t able to do anything at the time and I didn\u2019t have the strength. And that lives with me,\u201d he said.\n\nOther former Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses told how they were forced to share personal sexual experiences at a young age, after breaking rules set by the religion.\n\nOne woman, who wished to be anonymous, was called to a meeting with elders after she had sex at 15, which goes against the rule of no sex before marriage. \u201cThis meeting was three older men and me, a scared 15-year-old, who had just had sex for the first time. They had to know all the details before they chose my punishment,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had to answer questions like, did it hurt? Where were you? Did you enjoy it? I don\u2019t think any child that age should ever be in that situation.\u201d\n\nA former elder described how a congregation responded when a 13-year-old girl had sex. A judicial committee was called, and she was disfellowshipped and eventually asked to leave her parents\u2019 house.\n\nThe Guardian also heard from those who described strict upbringings and a culture of hierarchy which meant physical and other psychological abuse were rife and often ignored.\n\nStephanie, a former Jehovah\u2019s Witness, said that when she reported her own experience of domestic violence she was told by elders to do nothing.\n\nThe accused \u201cremained in the congregation with privileges and authority. Later, when I came out to the congregation elders as gay, they sent two men to my house ... and asked me in detail about sex and masturbation,\u201d she alleged.\n\nOperation Hydrant, a British police investigation into allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse, said that it was dealing with 45 potential victims of child abuse within a Jehovah\u2019s Witness setting. It said allegations could be made by a third party which either identifies \u2013 or does not identify \u2013 a potential victim.\n\nBased on the Guardian\u2019s findings, the commission said its inquiry into the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 governing body in the UK, was continuing and it encouraged anyone affected by safeguarding in congregations of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in England and Wales to come forward.\n\nHallisey said: \u201cGiven the number of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in the UK, and what we know about the pervasiveness of abuse in the organisation, there are likely to be hundreds and probably thousands more victims. This is truly just the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nShe said the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse should investigate. \u201cIt is absolutely critical that IICSA investigates the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses ... This is actually a public safety issue. The person knocking on your door or handing you literature in the street could be an accused or even admitted paedophile,\u201d she said.\n\nAn IICSA spokesperson said that while it was currently delivering its existing programme, the panel would \u201cconsider calls for a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses-specific investigation carefully\u201d as work progressed.\n\nIn a statement, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses said that safeguarding children was of the utmost importance. They said that a victim and their family had the right to report allegations of child abuse to the police, and that the principle of sufficient evidence was a scriptural rule not related to reporting an allegation of crime to the authorities. \u201cElders treat victims of child abuse with compassion, understanding, and kindness. Elders will conduct a scriptural investigation of every allegation of child sexual abuse,\u201d they said.", "author": ["Sarah Marsh"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/25/senior-labour-figures-defend-corbyn-row-antisemitic-mural", "published": "2018-03-25T16:51:22", "title": "Jewish leaders plan protest in Corbyn antisemitism row", "text": "Jewish leaders have called for a show of solidarity outside parliament on Monday evening to warn the Labour leadership that \u201cenough is enough\u201d, after Jeremy Corbyn was engulfed in a fresh antisemitism row.\n\nThe Jewish Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council issued what they described as a \u201ccall to action\u201d on Sunday, announcing they would be delivering a letter to the parliamentary Labour party before its regular weekly meeting on Monday.\n\nThe JLC (@JLC_uk) #EnoughIsEnough We call on members of our community and all those who oppose antisemitism to join us in Parliament Square at 5:30pm to show solidarity. https://t.co/S2nHp2a971 pic.twitter.com/lApuawcNrw\n\n\u201cDay in, day out, we the Jewish community face increasing antisemitism.

However, the request was written in Spanish and there was a delay while authorities in Madrid had it translated into English. In the meantime, Puigdemont left the country.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Puigdemont\u2019s press officer said: \u201cCarles Puigdemont has been detained in Germany as he crossed from Denmark en route to Belgium. He has been properly treated throughout and is right now in a police station. He was on his way to Belgium where he would be, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice.\u201d\n\nRalph D\u00f6pper, a deputy general attorney at the state prosecutor in Schleswig-Holstein, told the Guardian he was currently investigating whether Puigdemont would be placed into extradition custody, and he would announce his preliminary findings on Monday morning. On Sunday afternoon Puigdemont was transferred to Neum\u00fcnster prison in northern Schlewig-Holstein.\n\nCiting \u201crumours within judicial circles\u201d, the local newspaper Kieler Nachrichten reported that Puigdemont was considering applying for asylum in Germany. The paper added that the chances of an asylum application overriding the European arrest warrant were relatively slim.\n\nIn Spain, reacting to the news of Puigdemont\u2019s detention, Albert Rivera, leader of the centre-right Citizens party, said: \u201cThe flight of the coup plotter has come to an end.

There were also traffic go-slows on several main roads.\n\nPuigdemont had covered 808 miles (1,300km) of the 1,243-mile car journey when he was stopped at 11.19am, apparently at a petrol station near Schuby on the A7 motorway, 31 miles into German territory, according to his lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas.\n\nAccording to German media reports, the arrest was made following a tipoff from Spain\u2019s intelligence agency to German federal police\u2019s Sirene bureau, part of a network of information-sharing units for national police in the Schengen area.\n\nPuigdemont could face up to 25 years in prison in Spain if convicted of charges of rebellion and sedition for organising an illegal referendum for Catalonia that led to a unilateral declaration of independence in October.\n\nAccording to the rules of the European arrest warrant, Germany has up to 60 days to decide whether to extradite him to Spain. If Puigdemont surrenders to be prosecuted, the decision must be made within 10 days.\n\nThe international warrant, originally issued in November, was rescinded in December amid Spanish concerns that Belgium would not extradite Puigdemont for the more serious charges against him as they are not on the Belgian statute books.\n\n\n\nWere he to be extradited only on the lesser charge of misuse of public funds, he could be tried only for that offence.\n\nGermany can extradite suspects only if the alleged offence is also punishable under German law. The decision is supposed to be made by judicial authorities alone, without political interference.\n\nThere is no such crime as rebellion under German law, but there is a crime of high treason, defined as using force or the threat of force to undermine the constitutional order. It carries penalties ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.\n\nThe Catalan unilateral declaration of independence was entirely peaceful, if unlawful, although Spanish authorities may argue there was an implicit threat of force. The crime of sedition was dropped from German law in the 1970s.\n\nThe arrest warrant was reactivated on Friday, as were similar warrants for other Catalan fugitives \u2013 Llu\u00eds Puig, Meritxell Serret and Toni Com\u00edn, who are all in Belgium, and Clara Ponsati, currently in Scotland where she is teaching at the University of St Andrews.

Overall, EDF was found to be operating within the UK\u2019s exacting nuclear regulations.\n\n\n\n\u201cCurrent arrangements for the control of quality are judged, through ONR\u2019s wider regulatory activities, to be appropriate at present,\u201d said Foy.\n\nExperts said the inspection\u2019s conclusions were significant as nuclear regulation language is usually restrained.\n\nPaul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute at University College London, said: \u201cLooking at this report with a practiced eye, you can see that the UK regulators are worried, and things aren\u2019t necessarily going to get any better.\n\n\u201cIn all things nuclear, safety is absolutely paramount.

Speaking on Fox News on Sunday, and wearing a #MSDStrong T-shirt to underline the resilience of the new movement his school has spawned, he charged the NRA with wanting \u201cto sell weapons by exploiting people\u2019s fears. The second we try to put common-sense regulations on these assault weapons the NRA will say they are trying to steal your guns \u2013 fortunately people see past this.\u201d\n\nStoneman Douglas students were equally excoriating about the record of state and federal politicians in tackling the issue of gun violence since the shooting. Jaclyn Corin, the school\u2019s class president, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that she was unimpressed by the Stop School Violence Act that was included in the $1.3tn omnibus spending bill passed on Friday.\n\nYesterday, we Parkland students made history. And we're not going anywhere Read more\n\nThe legislation, she said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even mention the word \u2018gun\u2019 once. School safety is important, but [gun violence] doesn\u2019t just happen in schools, it\u2019s a public safety issue not a schools safety issue. We need to fight the problem from the core, which is guns.\u201d\n\nThe students spoke a day after the largest outpouring of public protest over America\u2019s lax gun laws in living memory. Hundreds of thousands of young people marched in more than 800 towns and cities across the US and around the world, directing a powerful roar for change at Congress members and the NRA lobbyists that exert outsized sway on so many of them.\n\nSurvivors and victims\u2019 relatives from the sorry litany of US gun rampages came together at the Washington march, neatly illustrating the extraordinary cost of America\u2019s fixation with the gun as well as the almost total lack of legislative measures over many years to stem the bloodletting. In addition to the leaders from the Parkland shooting, which occurred five weeks ago, there were survivors of rampages in: Las Vegas (five months ago), Orlando (21 months), Sandy Hook ( five years), Tucson (seven years), Virginia Tech (11 years) and Columbine (19 years) \u2013 and many more.\n\nNow that the dust has settled over the March for Our Lives, the newly-emboldened youth activists from Parkland, Florida, and across the nation are faced with the arguably more difficult challenge of sustaining their nascent #NeverAgain movement and translating it into concrete change. Student leaders have begun to articulate their demands, focusing on a nationwide ban on assault weapons with high-capacity magazines of the sort used to commit the Stoneman Douglas massacre, raising the age at which rifles can be bought to 21 and introducing universal background checks on all gun sales.\n\nMarchers across the US united in plan for pro-gun politicians: 'Vote them out' Read more\n\nA limited version of some of these demands has already been enacted in Florida, though the NRA immediately filed a lawsuit attempting to black the reforms.\n\nThe second major task for the activists following Saturday\u2019s marches is to mobilize young voters for the November mid-term elections. Though they do not plan to endorse specific candidates, they do intend to encourage young Americans to register to vote and to consider gun controls as a priority issue when they cast their ballots.\n\nEmma Gonzalez, who made one of the most powerful presentations at the Washington march, in which she remained largely silent through 6 minutes and 20 seconds \u2013 the duration of in the Parkland shooting \u2013 said that they were now \u201crevving up for the election\u201d. The Stoneman Douglas pupil told Face the Nation that \u201cthis is not the end, this was just the beginning\u201d.\n\nApathy among young eligible voters is a chronic problem in the US, with less than one in five 18-29 year olds bothering to go to the polling stations in the last mid-term elections four years ago. That was the lowest turnout for the age group in 40 years.\n\n\u201cThe voter turnout for our age is embarrassing,\u201d Kasky said. \u201cThis movement has so many people realizing it\u2019s important to get out to the polls.\u201d\n\nThe students may yet discover that the NRA makes for a formidable opponent. Face the Nation spoke to Joni Ernst, the Republican US senator from Iowa who is one of the top 10 recipients of NRA cash. Ernst denied she received more than $3m from the pro-gun lobbyist in the 2016 cycle, insisting the money went to outside groups supporting her campaign.\n\nParkland students: our manifesto to change America's gun laws | Editorial staff of the Eagle Eye Read more\n\n\u201cEvery citizen, as long as they are law-abiding, has the right to exercise their second-amendment rights,\u201d she said, repeating one of the NRA\u2019s most popular refrains.\n\nMeanwhile the pope seemed to refer to the demonstrations on Sunday when he addressed tens of thousands for a Palm Sunday service in St Peter\u2019s Square.\n\n\u201cThe temptation to silence young people has always existed,\u201d Pope Francis said. \u201cThere are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible.

Hopefully not the pilots though.\n\nBut any thought of immediate partying subsides as one of the two captains on board, Jeffrey Foote, tells us that we are experiencing turbulence.

She examines the nature of unconscious bias (how primary schoolchildren distinguish between women\u2019s jobs and men\u2019s jobs, and how employers tend to choose men over women even when they have the same CVs), why women are often paid less for work of equal value, why women can\u2019t ask for more money but men can, and, perhaps most importantly, how working mothers are discriminated against.\n\nBefore we start, Brady reaches for her iPhone. \u201cCan I send my daughter a text? She wants me to give her a call. I think she\u2019s had a promotion at work.\u201d She taps away at supersonic speed, then looks up. \u201cRight. So. Have you seen the programme? What did you think of it?\u201d\n\nShe reminds me of Max Clifford, another supreme self-brander. Clifford would always start interviews by \u201creceiving\u201d phone calls from, say, Simon Cowell or Beyonc\u00e9, thanking him for everything he had done for them. Brady\u2019s narrative is different \u2013 this is the woman who has everything: brilliant businesswoman, TV star and supermum. She glances at her huge gold watch. I sense the timer is running.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brady with David Sullivan, 1993. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise she has made this programme. After all, on The Apprentice she often pulls up contestants for throwaway sexist remarks, or signals her disapproval with a killer arched eyebrow. What makes her career so fascinating is that, at the same time as championing women\u2019s rights, she has been associated most closely with some of industry\u2019s great unreconstructed dinosaurs \u2013 Sugar, Green and the former pornographer David Sullivan, owner of Birmingham City and now West Ham.\n\nThe programme is a powerful exploration of gender inequality at work, and makes me wonder how she challenges some of the male attitudes she comes across in the boardroom.\n\nOne of her missions in the documentary is to teach women how to ask for a pay rise \u2013 she tells viewers she only agreed to appear on The Apprentice so long as nobody was paid more than her. It\u2019s amazing you get paid as much as Sugar, I say, seeing as it\u2019s basically his show. She looks embarrassed. \u201cNo, no. I think that came across completely wrong. I did point that out to the makers, actually. Alan is obviously the main person on the show. I meant the roles that are equal to mine \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t accept being paid less.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s similar public confusion over her personal wealth, which has been estimated at \u00a385m. \u201cThat\u2019s complete rubbish, I\u2019m not worth anything like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s Wikipedia. There\u2019s not much I can do about that.\u201d But the beauty of Wikipedia is that you can ask for information to be corrected.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brady in the House of Lords, 2014. Photograph: PA\n\nIn the documentary, Brady is constantly left \u201copen-mouthed\u201d or \u201cspeechless\u201d at her discoveries. For example, she says that even though it\u2019s illegal to ask women in an interview if they have children, 46% of employers think this is fine, and 41% think working mothers are a burden on the team. It\u2019s strange she was shocked by this finding. After all, Sugar famously said that if he couldn\u2019t ask women whether they had children, the solution was not to hire them. Has she challenged him on this? She looks surprised. \u201cWell, I have never heard the quote you\u2019ve just put to me, so I\u2019ve never tackled him about it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever worked in business, but you don\u2019t go around going raaaah [she roars], having these massive confrontations.\u201d In 2010, I say, you were was asked about his comment in the Guardian. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t remember!\u201d she says. \u201cPutting him to one side, my view is that the inference, by asking, is that those women are not as dedicated or hardworking or ambitious. I know myself, from being a working woman, that is not the case.\u201d\n\nBrady grew up in Edmonton, north London. Her Irish father Terry was a self-made, Rolls-Royce driving millionaire, who made his fortune in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls Catholic boarding school, which she hated. \u201cYou do what you\u2019re told, you wear what you\u2019re told, you eat what you\u2019re told, you go to bed when you\u2019re told.\u201d It made her ambitious for a different life, she says. \u201cI was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.\u201d After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys school \u2013 one of only six girls. She left with four A-levels, but decided she wanted to make money rather than go to university. She joined Saatchi & Saatchi at 18, then went to work for LBC, where she targeted her father\u2019s client, David Sullivan, to advertise with the radio station.\n\nHe placed \u00a32m worth of advertising with LBC. Before long, Sullivan headhunted her, bought Birmingham City at her instigation, and, when she was 23, made her CEO. Sullivan bought the club for \u00a3700,000 in 1993, and sold it in 2009 for \u00a382m. Much of Brady\u2019s wealth is thought to date back to the sale of the club. By the time she left, 75% of senior management were women.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brady with Alan Sugar and Nick Hewer on the Young Apprentice, 2010. Photograph: BBC/TALKBACK THAMES/TALKBACK THAMES\n\nSullivan and Brady remain umbilically tied. In 2010, he bought West Ham United (with former Birmingham co-owner David Gold). Again, Brady was given the job of running the commercial side of the club \u2013 though her title was now vice-chairman rather than CEO.The stories of sexism she has faced in football are legion. At her first game as CEO she asked directions to the boardroom and was told \u201cdirectors\u2019 wives go this way\u201d. When opposition fans chanted \u201cKarren Brady is a whore\u201d, she had to tell her grandmother they were singing \u201cKarren Brady is 24\u201d. Then there is the story of the player who said to her: \u201cI can see your tits in that top.\u201d She is said to have replied: \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry \u2013 when I sell you to Crewe, you won\u2019t be able to see them from there.\u201d Is that true? She smiles. \u201cYeah. Three days later when I sold him, it was the best deal I ever did.\u201d Who was the player? \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Only because he happens to be a friend of my husband, and he is so embarrassed about what he did that I\u2019ve promised I would never reveal who it was.\u201d She also sold her husband, former footballer Paul Peschisolido, twice, making a profit on him both times. She is at her best telling these stories \u2013 funny, lively, a natural performer.\n\nI wonder if she\u2019s ever torn a strip off Sullivan over his views on women. What did she say, for example, when she discovered that he had been a patron of the Presidents Club \u2013 the men-only charitable trust that held galas where businessmen were recently caught groping female hostesses who had been asked, in advance, to sign non-disclosure agreements?\n\nShe looks aghast. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was a patron,\u201d she says. \u201cAbsolutely not. No, absolutely not. He attended many, many years ago, but he didn\u2019t like it and never went again.\u201d Are you sure? \u201c100%.\u201d She asked him? \u201cNo, he just mentioned it in passing.\u201d\n\nShe answers with such conviction that I assume I have got it wrong. But later I check the Presidents Club brochure that emerged after the event. Sure enough, Sullivan is named as a patron. Although it is true he did not attend this year\u2019s gala, his son Jack \u2013 managing director of West Ham Ladies \u2013 did.\n\nIn the documentary, Brady says the most difficult obstacle facing women at work is returning after maternity leave. After the birth of her first child, she took only three days\u2019 leave. Although many women regard her as a fantastic role model, some would say she succeeded not by championing women\u2019s rights and needs but by hurdling them. Did she feel she had to \u201cman-up\u201d to stand a chance? \u201cIt\u2019s not language that I would use. I just felt this overwhelming sense of responsibility that I had to be there, and I couldn\u2019t let people down and I had to bring up a child. And it just manifested itelf in very little maternity leave. It\u2019s something I deeply regret. It\u2019s not something I would ever encourage.\u201d\n\nA few years ago she said she would never take a year\u2019s maternity leave \u2013 the amount women are legally entitled to \u2013 and that \u201cThere would be no CEO, I think, that would take a year off.\u201d Have her views changed since then? \u201cNo, because I could not take a year off. I wish I\u2019d taken more time than I did, but not a year.\u201d Does she still believe that no CEO would ever take a year off? She insists she does not remember saying that, and that it is up to the individual.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Moyes. Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nI look at the Bobby Moore painting above her head. It must be a pretty awful time at West Ham \u2013 the threat of relegation, the lack of quality transfers, widespread unhappiness with their new ground in what was the 2012 London Olympics stadium (Brady negotiated a bargain rent of \u00a32.5m a year, but fans have complained it was not built for football). There is unhappiness, too, with the manager David Moyes and, perhaps most of all, with the three people at the top of the club \u2013 owners Sullivan and Gold, and Brady, whose annual salary is \u00a3868,000.\n\nEarlier this month, there was a violent pitch invasion and coins were thrown at the directors\u2019 box. What was even more shaming was that the match marked the 25th anniversary of Moore\u2019s death, and was supposed to celebrate the club icon.\n\nIt must have been horrifying, I say. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about West Ham,\u201d says Brady, \u201cbecause this [the TV show] is something that is really important to me, and I don\u2019t want to cloud the two issues. This is something I\u2019ve done on my Sundays and days off to shine a light on the equality issues for women and I would like to focus on that.\u201d\n\nBut, I say, the subjects are not unrelated. Some of the attacks target you particularly as a woman. \u201cI disagree. I\u2019ve never heard anybody shout at me. I obviously get social media comments, but I think everybody does in the public eye and you just have to live with that. A lot of the aggression has been channelled at the two chairmen, the two owners.\u201d\n\nShe looks at her laptop, and says it is time for her to get on with the rest of her day. Shortly before selling Birmingham City, Sullivan said he had lost the support of the fans and when that happens it is time to walk away. Has that time not come at West Ham? \u201cI\u2019ve never walked away from anything I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m not going to start now. I genuinely believe the move we made to the stadium is the right one. That\u2019s why we had 52,000 season ticket holders, and why 90% of those renewed.\u201d Again, she says, we are not here to talk about West Ham. I say I have one more question related to women at work.\n\nLast year, after a post-match interview, the then Sunderland manager Moyes told BBC reporter Vicki Sparks that she \u201cmight get a slap, even though you\u2019re a woman\u201d because she was being \u201ca wee bit naughty\u201d. Moyes was fined \u00a330,000 by the FA. In her column in the Sun, Brady wrote: \u201cHopefully the penny has dropped for him that it\u2019s not OK to patronise, intimidate and threaten women and treat them as if they are impostors in a man\u2019s world. End. Of.\u201d Seven months later he was appointed West Ham manager. I can\u2019t begin to understand how she agreed to hiring him.\n\nDid you have no qualms, I begin to say. She cuts me off. \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say. Can we just concentrate on the programme.\u201d Let me at least ask the question, I say. Again, she cuts me off. \u201cI\u2019ve already made a comment about that, and I don\u2019t want to go there. If you want to talk about the programme, I\u2019m really, really happy to, but I really don\u2019t feel this is an interview about West Ham or talking about my manager or talking about the troubles my chairmen face. I\u2019ve agreed to see you today because it\u2019s a serious issue.\u201d But this issue is about just that \u2013 treating women equally at work. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve used this programme to attack my chairmen, to attack Lord Sugar, attack David Moyes,\u201d she says.\n\nI\u2019m not attacking them, I say. I\u2019m just asking how you hold men with clout to account when they treat women unfairly. \u201cWhatever ...\u201d she mutters. The smile has gone. Suddenly the room feels very cold. I change the subject. But wherever I head we run into trouble. In the documentary, she bemoans the lack of legislation to ensure women are paid equally for doing jobs of equal worth. I ask what she plans to do about this as a peer. \u201cWell, obviously in the Lords we review legislation so all we can do is keep campaigning for these issues to be pushed higher and higher up the agenda. But I don\u2019t really have any political activities.\u201d How can you say that when you\u2019re a Tory peer? She doesn\u2019t answer.\n\nSo we return to the safe territory of Brady\u2019s brilliant career. Yes, she says, she is proud of herself. \u201cWhen I left school at 18 with no qualifications,\u201d \u2013 she seems to have forgotten her nine O-levels and four A-levels \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was going to do with my life. I\u2019ve taken every opportunity, pushed myself in ways I\u2019m not sure I knew were even possible, I\u2019ve made the best of my life and career. So yes, I do feel proud of myself.\u201d\n\nDespite her inconsistencies and selective memory, Brady should be proud of herself. Hers is a remarkable story. She has let nothing hold her back, not even a life-threatening brain aneurysm in 2006. She says this simply made her realise how short life is, and redouble her efforts. She looks at the time again.\n\nWhat ambitions are still unfulfilled? \u201cI don\u2019t know. The toughest thing about being a success is you\u2019ve got to keep on being a success. You have to do the things you\u2019re passionate about, that you love. Who the hell wants to get to 48 and think: \u2018I wish I would have, I should have \u2026 I could have done this, I might have done that.\u2019 You don\u2019t really do much in life unless you take risks, push yourself and find your passion.\u201d\n\nAt times, it is hard to know what Brady\u2019s passion is. She doesn\u2019t seem mad about football, despite running two clubs for half her life; nor about politics, despite being a Conservative peer. But there is undeniably passion. You can see it in her face, her drive, her hunger to achieve. It\u2019s passion for family, for business, for leading from the front, for being Karren Brady.\n\nI get up to go. She is thinking about the future \u2013 what\u2019s left to conquer. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to be a Cabinet minister. I don\u2019t want to be an MP, I don\u2019t want to be mayor of London.\u201d Why not mayor? \u201cBecause at the moment I have too much on.\u201d She pauses. There\u2019s a twinkle in her eye, and the warmth has returned. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s an ambition for the future,\u201d she says.\n\nWhy Do Men Earn More Than Women? is at 10pm on 4 April, Channel 5", "author": ["Simon Hattenstone"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/25/may-super-obese-children-surgery-life-changing-bariatric-gastric-band", "published": "2018-03-25T16:00:04", "title": "\u200b'Before, I couldn't walk 200m'\u200b \u2013 why surgery can be life-changing for super-obese children", "text": "When Vicky Counsell was 16, her doctor told her that if she didn\u2019t have surgery to reduce her weight, there was a good chance it would kill her. She was 140kg (22st), her weight gain accelerated by the steroids she was taking for a lung condition, and she had tried everything to lose it. \u201cIt was an easy choice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was life or death.\u201d At 17, she had gastric band surgery, in which a band around the stomach creates a small pouch, meaning only a small amount of food can be consumed. Ten years on, she has lost more than 44kg (7st). \u201cBefore the surgery, I couldn\u2019t even walk on the flat for 200m,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I walk for miles.\u201d She works as a support worker for older people, a physical job she couldn\u2019t have done before.\n\nAlthough it has \u201cdefinitely been worth it\u201d, she wasn\u2019t prepared for how difficult living with a gastric band would be. \u201cI remember the doctors telling me I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat a lot of food, but I don\u2019t think I realised how tough it would be,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the very beginning I couldn\u2019t even keep water or juice down. Now I can\u2019t eat bread, pizza or anything high-carb.\u201d It can be difficult going to restaurants with friends and explaining to waiters what she can and can\u2019t eat, and she says her portion sizes are about what you would give a child. It is a lifelong commitment, which as a teenager she says she didn\u2019t really grasp.\n\nLast week, the new president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Russell Viner, said that the NHS could be doing up to 100 times more obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, on the most obese children and teenagers. In England, on the NHS last year, there were 18 cases of bariatric surgery performed on patients aged 17 and under (12 of those were for gastric bypasses, in which the stomach is sectioned off into a smaller part which is joined to the small intestine). The number has been fairly stable for the last few years \u2013 the year before, it was 11; five years ago, there were 16 procedures. But, according to Viner, the number of children who could be considered eligible is around 90,000.\n\n\u201cMost of those will not want it and I\u2019m absolutely not suggesting that they all get it, but what we have is an exceptional mismatch between those who are [operated on and those who are] theoretically eligible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how many we should be doing. It\u2019s important that this is seen within a broader response to obesity. The first response is prevention, absolutely. The second is to say we have a significant number of children who are already obese and, for the very obese, no amount of prevention is going to make an impact on their lives right now. We need to get away from this idea that surgery is somehow \u2018giving in\u2019 to people. It all arises from the idea that obesity is people\u2019s fault and they shouldn\u2019t get surgery for it, they should just work harder.\u201d\n\nSurgery is a last resort, following months or years of attempted weight management, but he adds: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t shy away from last resorts. Bariatric surgery is incredibly effective. Once you are very, very obese, the chances of you losing a significant amount of weight without bariatric surgery are very low. We\u2019re talking about super-obese teenagers.\u201d In adults, Nice guidelines suggest that bariatric surgery is an option for those with a BMI of 40 or above, or 35 and above if they have comorbidities (eg, type 2 diabetes or other associated serious health problems). The guidelines for children state that, \u201cBariatric surgery may be considered for young people only in exceptional circumstances, and if they have achieved or nearly achieved physiological maturity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s done very carefully, within the NHS with an experienced team, including psychologists and social workers and others, it can be life-changing,\u201d says Viner. It is, for many obese teenagers, \u201cthe only way. Once you become super-obese, your body fights weight loss. There are potentially new drugs that may become available over the next few years, but at the moment it\u2019s the only proven way we know to do it.\u201d\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t shy away from last resorts. Bariatric surgery is incredibly effective\n\nSo why is the surgery so rarely performed on young people? \u201cThere are a range of barriers,\u201d says Viner. \u201cNumber one, there are barriers to all bariatric surgery. We know we should be doing more adult bariatric surgery.\u201d This is probably down to cost, he says, though surgery is cost effective to the health service in the long term. \u201cSecond, there are particular barriers to teenagers; people get fearful about doing what they perceive is a very big operation on teenagers. Then there are concerns about people\u2019s ability to consent. There are a whole range of reasons why people are much more careful, and we should be, but I think we need to think as well about the benefits of surgery.\u201d\n\nWe know we are in an obesity epidemic, with the UK doing worse than most. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that we are the most obese nation in western Europe, with 26.9% of adults classed as obese. In England, 32.4% of girls and 36.1% of boys leaving primary school are overweight or obese, with children in deprived areas more than twice as likely to be affected than those in affluent areas. The causes are numerous and complex, involving everything from genetics to environment to education to poverty, and especially the power of the food corporations. Viner has called for a ban on adverts for junk food before the watershed and for Ofsted to include a school\u2019s PE provision and healthy meals in inspections. Of course, the vast majority of overweight or obese children won\u2019t end up having bariatric surgery, but some will.\n\nViner emphasises that performing bariatric surgery on someone under 14 is only to be done in extreme cases. Examples of when it might be considered include if someone has uncontrolled diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea (where breathing stops during sleep) or liver disease. \u201cWhere it has been done in this country, it has been for life-threatening complications,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are exceptional cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be waking up to obesity as a disease, and it is taking hold in epidemic proportions,\u201d says Shaw Somers, consultant bariatric surgeon at Portsmouth hospitals NHS trust, and president of the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society. \u201cWe are ignoring it at the moment and we\u2019re doing a pitiful number of interventions \u2013 medical treatments as well as surgical treatments. We need to wake up and start dealing with it properly, both prevention for children and adolescents as well as adults.\u201d\n\nSomers has operated on several teenagers, \u201cand to this day I worry about them\u201d. The youngest was 15. \u201cI would probably balk at much younger than that.\u201d You are, he says, \u201cdrastically changing their digestive system\u201d. To do this on a child or younger teenager could put them at risk of malnutrition and not developing properly. \u201cThat all adds an extra layer of complexity. If you can spend three or four years getting a 13-year-old patient prepared for surgery as well as you can, and then make the final decision at that stage, at 16 or 17, I think you do them a better service than just operating on them at 13.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shaw Somers: \u2018Obesity is taking hold in epidemic proportions.\u2019 Photograph: Ken McKay/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe surgery itself is relatively safe \u2013 though still a significant operation \u2013 but it is also too new for there to be data on the long-term safety of undergoing it, particularly as a teenager. \u201cThe risks of surgery are negligible compared with the benefits of weight loss,\u201d says Somers. But, for some people, there can be complications such as the gut leaking or becoming blocked, and even in cases where the procedure has gone well, there is still lifelong monitoring afterwards. Nutrition still needs to be carefully watched, especially throughout pregnancy in women who had one of the procedures. Some treatments, such as a gastric band or bypass, can technically be reversed, but with varying difficulty and further possible complications.\n\n\u201cIf you perform this surgery on a young person, you hope they\u2019re going to live a long time, and they will need monitoring for a long time,\u201d says Somers. Does he think a 14-year-old can give informed consent to have surgery which comes with long-term aftercare? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe they can make properly judged consent over a long-term issue. It requires a multidisciplinary approach [including psychological assessment, and support from the family], so while the individual adolescent might wish for the surgery we\u2019ve got to be very careful. If we are going to do surgery we ought to do the reversible types.\u201d With patients he has operated on at the younger end of the age range, \u201cI judged them to have capacity and the family were in agreement, and their psychologist was. Generally speaking, they are happy with the result and it has turned their life around.\u201d\n\nBut, like Viner, he stresses that bariatric surgery on very young people is a last resort and that these super-obese adolescents are already suffering from serious problems caused by their weight. \u201cYou can\u2019t just wait until they become adults before you start to look into how to help them.\u201d", "author": ["Emine Saner"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/25/march-for-our-lives-white-suburban-liberals-minority-activists-fight-together-for-gun-control", "published": "2018-03-25T19:22:36", "title": "'We share the stage': white suburban liberals and minority activists fight together for gun reform", "text": "There is no national day of protest marking the death of Edna Chavez\u2019s brother.

Photograph: Paul Morigi/Getty Images\n\nSaturday\u2019s protests in Washington and across the world mark a profound shift in America\u2019s gun control debate.\n\nFor decades, political analysts have said that Congress\u2019s refusal to pass new gun laws was due to an \u201cintensity gap\u201d between the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun control supporters.\n\nPolls have long shown that a majority of Americans support stricter gun laws, but that majority has not organized, lobbied, protested or voted in primary elections with the discipline of the gun rights advocates, whose numbers are much smaller.\n\nJada Wright, 17, and her boyfriend Carl Payne, 18, from Washington. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein for the Guardian\n\nBut the \u201cintensity gap\u201d, like the concept of \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d, is dangerously vague, a talking point that conceals more than it reveals.\n\n\n\nThere has never been an \u201cintensity gap\u201d between NRA members, and the young activists and heartbroken parents in Oakland or St Louis or Miami. For decades, with media attention or without it, black and brown communities have pushed for stricter regulation of the gun industry and for laws that would keep guns out of the hands of at-risk teenagers and adults.\n\nBut the Americans most influenced by everyday gun murder are a minority, packed into a relatively small number of congressional districts.\n\nDaisy Hernandez, 22, from Stafford, Virginia. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein for the Guardian\n\nWorking alone, they\u2019ve never had the votes in Congress to pass the gun control laws they want. They\u2019ve needed allies \u2013 the allies from liberal white suburbs, who, at least in theory, support stricter gun control laws.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cintensity gap\u201d has always been an \u201cempathy gap\u201d, because those suburban allies have rarely shown up to fight for the lives of black and brown children \u2013 not unless their own schools, their own children, were threatened.\n\nBy bringing out hundreds of thousands of people in Washington and across the world, the Parkland students have shown more evidence that they might be able to close the intensity gap, and convince millions of Americans to vote in the 2018 election on a gun control platform.\n\nClockwise from left: Ayah Syeed, 16, from Herndon, Virginia; Jasmine Rachele, 16, and Sarah Crosier, 17, from Manchester, VT; protesters hold up signs; Madison Tittle, 17, foreground, from Colorado Springs. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein for the Guardian\n\n\n\n\u201cVote them out!\u201d the Washington crowd kept chanting. \u201cVote them out!\u201d\n\nBut the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas also made a concerted effort to close the empathy gap \u2013 to acknowledge decades of erasure of activists of color, and to put them on stage, not as a token figure at the end of a long row of mass shooting victims, but as central voices in the movement.\n\nFour different Chicago activists spoke at the March for Our Lives in Washington, along with young activists of color from DC, Brooklyn, and suburban Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe share the stage today and always with those who have always stared down the barrel of a gun,\u201d Jaclyn Corin, a Stoneman Douglas student and one of the event\u2019s organizers, told the crowd.\n\nSuburban kids affected by gun violence are usually treated as innocent victims. Young Americans of color who are shot are blamed for their behavior, and held responsible for becoming a target. But at the March for Our Lives, all of the young speakers were presented the same way: as students, as survivors, and as a powerful challenge to the political status quo.\n\nAs Edna Chavez spoke, some of her fellow youth activists from Los Angeles\u2019 Community Coalition sat onstage with her, watching the crowd\u2019s reaction with shock and pride.\n\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and other speakers at the rally in Washington. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein for the Guardian\n\n\u201cShe tapped into the hearts and minds of the whole crowd,\u201d said Fernando Mosqueda, 16. When he looked on social media, \u201ceveryone was supporting her and showing her love and seeing themselves in her.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the way people usually see South Central, Mosqueda said. When he\u2019s at home, he has to be on guard, worried people will look at him and see not a high school student, or a youth activist, but a Latino gang member.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, he was listening to a national rally chant the name of one of the black and brown kids killed on an normal day in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had that much attention,\u201d he said. \u201cShe finally got a national platform.\u201d\n\nMosqueda and Hakim Johnson, 16, said they are both cautiously optimistic that the current movement will achieve some change.\n\nHearing Jennifer Hudson sing with a choir at the end of the rally was \u201clike the bells, signaling bells of change that things will no longer be the same, that we don\u2019t have to take this, from the 90s to now, we don\u2019t have to sit through the same gun violence, we don\u2019t have to worry about who snuck a gun into school, who\u2019s going to shoot up the block,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBut having a national gun control movement that includes the voices and stories of young people of color is only the first step.\n\nThe policy solutions that a national movement is trying to achieve also have to reflect the goals of the survivors of everyday gun violence \u2013 and some of those solutions require a very different approach than the policy proposals of the Parkland advocates, who have focused on banning civilian ownership of military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as closing loopholes in the background check system.\n\n\n\nA sign prohibiting guns at the Washington march. Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein for the Guardian\n\n\u201cDoes Gun Control include the police?\u201d Chance the Rapper, a Chicago artist and activist, asked on Twitter Saturday night. \u201cShould police have ARs?\u201d\n\n\n\nChavez and the young activists from Chicago made similar points: they were interested in gun control, but they also wanted economic investment in their communities, focused on \u201cchanging the conditions that foster violence and trauma,\u201d as Chavez put it. Putting more police officers in schools to fuel the school-to-prison pipeline would not protect children of color from violence.\n\n\u201cInstead of making black and brown students feel safe, they continue to profile and criminalize us,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cInstead [of police], we should have a department specializing in restorative justice.\u201d\n\nFor activists of color, certain approaches to gun control laws are also seen as harmful.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to remove the guns, but not to criminalize the people who have them,\u201d Mosqueda said. \u201cMass incarceration is already too big. It\u2019s already too abusive. We need to make sure we\u2019re using careful tactics, to remove them effectively but without putting people in jail.\u201d", "author": ["Lois Beckett", "Evelyn Hockstein"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/25/henry-moore-rubbished-barbara-hepworth-sculpture-diaries-say", "published": "2018-03-25T14:28:44", "title": "Henry Moore rubbished Barbara Hepworth sculpture, diaries say", "text": "Revered artist said to have slated rival sculptor\u2019s work when Tate board was considering buying it\n\nHe is revered as one of the masters of 20th-century British sculpture, but Henry Moore belittled rival artists while promoting himself within the Tate gallery, according to previously unpublished diaries.\n\nIn 1945, the Tate\u2019s board was considering whether to purchase a wooden sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. Moore, then a gallery trustee, interjected with the damning words: \u201cIf sculpture [was] nothing more than that, it would be a poor affair.\u201d The ploy worked. The Hepworth was rejected by the board, while every one of seven sculptures the Tate bought that year was by none other than Henry Moore. The incident is recorded in the diaries of John Rothenstein, who headed the Tate for 26 years from 1938.\n\nThe \u201cfull and chatty\u201d diaries have until now remained largely unseen within the Tate archive, but Rothenstein\u2019s daughter made the material available to Adrian Clark for a book on her father.\n\nClark writes in his book that the Hepworth sculpture, described by Rothenstein as a \u201cshaft\u201d, would have been a valuable acquisition. Hepworth\u2019s works can now fetch seven-figure sums.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Every one of the seven sculptures bought by Tate in 1945 was by Henry Moore. Photograph: unknown/BBC\n\nMoore was not the only self-interested artist-cum-trustee, Rothenstein\u2019s diaries show. Another was John Piper, who argued against acquiring works by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse and for focusing on British art instead. \u201cPiper\u2019s work was being acquired in spades,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThey\u2019re so hypocritical these people. Tate thought it was a great idea having artist-trustees on the board rather than aristocrats.\u201d\n\nClark noted parallels with the 2006 case in which the Charity Commission criticised Tate for buying art by serving trustees, including a \u00a3600,000 work by Chris Ofili.\n\nAmong the trustees in 1945 was Kenneth Clark, a leading authority on Italian Renaissance art who was to write and narrate the landmark BBC series and book Civilisation. Rothenstein\u2019s entry for the acquisitions meeting records that Clark was just as disparaging as Moore of Hepworth\u2019s sculpture, saying that abstract art was a \u201cheresy\u201d and that he doubted whether Tate should admit any of it.\n\nAdrian Clark said that although Rothenstein made mistakes, the Tate director had been unfairly criticised for the gallery\u2019s purchase choices. \u201cHe was trapped between the traditionalist attitude \u2026 where anything modern was negative, and French-loving art historians who thought anything British was rubbish \u2026 But he was dealing with people like Clark and Moore who you\u2019d think would be relatively open to modern art. Even they weren\u2019t. In fact, they were far worse. The artist-trustees were completely viperous.\u201d\n\n\n\nRothenstein was one of Francis Bacon\u2019s early supporters, arranging his first Tate retrospective in 1962. Adrian Clark said: \u201cHe [Rothenstein] was fully prepared to like and support modern art if he thought it was good.\u201d\n\nOn one occasion, Rothenstein records Bacon saying: \u201cHenry Moore can\u2019t even imagine another contemporary artist being any good.\u201d In another passage, he recorded Bacon bursting into tears on reading the introduction to his exhibition catalogue, saying \u201cit was by far the best thing ever written on him\u201d.\n\nIn 1950, Rothenstein wrote of visiting Lucian Freud, describing his studio as \u201cgrotesque in its squalor\u201d, adding: \u201cBut his work has exquisite and imaginative qualities.\u201d A couple of years later, the board of the Tate bought two Freud pictures. While that decision was supported by Piper, Moore was \u201ccool\u201d, Rothenstein observed in one 1952 entry.\n\nFighting on All Fronts: John Rothenstein in the Art World is published by Unicorn on 11 April.", "author": ["Dalya Alberge"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2018/mar/25/ben-jennings-on-cambridge-analyticas-role-in-the-vote-leave-campaign-cartoon", "published": "2018-03-25T18:55:17", "title": "Ben Jennings on Cambridge Analytica's role in the Vote Leave campaign \u2013 cartoon", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s gift for empathy does much to explain his remarkable electoral performance last June. But his wholly inadequate response to the Tower Hamlets mural controversy suggests that this gift may have clear \u2013 and alarming \u2013 limits.\n\nTo recap: in 2012, a wall painting by the street artist Mear One in east London was designated for removal by the local authority. Using grotesquely antisemitic imagery, it depicted Jewish financiers playing a Monopoly-style board game on the backs of naked people. On the artist\u2019s Facebook page, Corbyn posted the following response to this decision: \u201cWhy? You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera\u2019s [Rivera\u2019s] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\u201d\n\nIn the great discourse of left identity politics, Jews were now definitively on the wrong side of the line\n\nLast week, Luciana Berger, the Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, asked the leader\u2019s office for an explanation. The initial statement read as follows: \u201cIn 2012, Jeremy was responding to concerns about the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech. However, the mural was offensive, used antisemitic imagery, which has no place in our society, and it is right that it was removed.\u201d\n\nThis made no sense, since the point of Corbyn\u2019s original post was that the removal of the mural was unjustified. A second statement was issued, in which the Labour leader declared: \u201cI sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on.\u201d Again, this fell far short of what was required. \u201cRegret\u201d is the word politicians use when they wish to avoid apologising. And how \u201cclosely\u201d did Corbyn have to look at the mural, which resembled a homage to the Nazi newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer, to spot its vicious hostility to Jews?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn during the Holocaust Memorial Day service, London, 2017. Photograph: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAt this stage of the argument, Corbyn\u2019s supporters object in two ways. The first is to engage in furious \u201cwhataboutery\u201d: what about racism on the right? What about Conservative prejudice? To which I reply: having spent 20 years calling out Tory xenophobia and (more recently) Brexiteer bigotry, I don\u2019t need permission to question Labour\u2019s attitude to antisemitism.\n\nSecond, it is customary to dismiss questions about the leadership\u2019s response to antisemitism as wilful distraction or even a means of sabotaging Corbyn\u2019s position and plans. Last September, Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, described previous allegations of antisemitism as \u201cmood music that was created by people who were trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The film director Ken Loach put it no less pithily: \u201cIt\u2019s funny these stories suddenly appeared when Jeremy Corbyn became leader, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nJewish leaders plan protest in Corbyn antisemitism row Read more\n\nThe real question is otherwise: why does Corbyn \u2013 admirably proactive in tackling other forms of prejudice \u2013 seem to squirm and dither when confronted with allegations of antisemitism? As Richard Gold, a party member active in the anti-racist Engage campaign, put it in his submission to Shami Chakrabarti\u2019s inquiry into Labour antisemitism: \u201c[It is] as though being unpleasant to Jews \u2026 should be excused or minimised, treated merely as rudeness or bad manners, rather than racist behaviour.\u201d\n\nIn his recent book, Contemporary Left Antisemitism, David Hirsh argued that the problem was turbo-charged by three events in 2001: the collapse of the Middle East peace process, the anti-imperialist rhetoric that followed 9/11 and the UN conference in Durban at which \u201cZionism\u201d was designated a form of white racism. This set the stage for, in Hirsh\u2019s words, \u201can antisemitism which positions Jews themselves as \u2018oppressors\u2019 and \u2026 those who develop hostile narratives about Jews as \u2018oppressed\u2019.\u201d In the great discourse of left identity politics, Jews were now definitively on the wrong side of the line: powerful, white, aligned with imperialism.\n\nAccording to this twisted logic, Mear One\u2019s mural could not, axiomatically, be judged racist \u2013 any more than Ken Livingstone\u2019s outbursts, the antisemitic content posted on social media by the Labour MP Naz Shah, or the alleged hostility to Jews at the Oxford University Labour Club. The leadership might be forced by media or political pressure to take action against such conduct. But it manifestly did so with an eye to optics rather than as a matter of principle.\n\nLabour MPs challenge Corbyn on antisemitism and Brexit Read more\n\nAntisemitism is on the rise all over the world. According to the Community Security Trust, a record number of antisemitic incidents were reported in the UK last year. Why does this bother Corbyn as little as it seems to? Does he believe in universal rights and equality of worth, or not? The fact that the Labour leader appears to regard allegations of antisemitism as an irritant rather than a fundamental issue says nothing good about him. In this respect, at least, the writing is upon the wall.", "author": ["Matthew D'Ancona"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/good-reasons-for-ignoring-the-news-david-mitchell-trump-erik-hagerman", "published": "2018-03-25T10:00:27", "title": "There are good reasons for ignoring the news | David Mitchell", "text": "Did you hear about the rich American who\u2019s cut himself off from all news since Donald Trump was elected? There\u2019s no reason why you should. He wouldn\u2019t have done, if it hadn\u2019t actually been him. His name\u2019s Erik Hagerman and he used to be a Nike executive, but now lives on a pig farm and doesn\u2019t even farm pigs. He just works on his art and goes for coffee and plays guitar and gives interviews to the New York Times. Which presumably he then doesn\u2019t read, so the interviewer could have indulged in a rare consequence-free, easy-to-write hatchet job, but didn\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be snide \u2013 things I say neutrally just come out like that. It\u2019s the rhetorical equivalent of people whose faces\u2019 resting expressions look deeply sad or intensely cross, so they have to smile to seem normal (which must cumulatively be depressing or irritating, thus retrospectively giving them temperaments to match their looks). Because, as it happens, I support Erik Hagerman\u2019s life choice.\n\nThen again, I\u2019ve got a few nits to pick. For a start, the whole art thing\u2019s a bit lame \u2013 you can see his stuff online. He just does sort of scrunched things and patterns and, well, fine, but if there\u2019s enough rolling news in the world, there\u2019s more than enough crap art. Plus, his non-consumption of news media seems to involve a lot of slightly precious \u201cbusiness\u201d. It smacks of the self-involvement of those who believe their allergies make them interesting.\n\nI think I\u2019ll always value a vague sense of what seems to be generally going on\n\nFor example, in order to avoid accidentally hearing any careless talk at the coffee shop he goes to every morning, he wears headphones playing white noise. He says music won\u2019t do because \u201cstray conversation can creep in between songs\u201d. He still watches basketball on TV but on mute so that no contemporary reference sneaks through. And he\u2019s given his lifestyle a name, which is annoying even before you hear the name, at which point it gets more annoying.\n\nHe\u2019s called it \u201cthe Blockade\u201d. That\u2019s all wrong, and not deliberately, I don\u2019t think. A blockade is a siege. Ingress to, or egress from, an entity is prevented by outsiders. What Hagerman\u2019s doing \u2013 the entity in the middle trying to prevent ingress from the outside world \u2013 isn\u2019t a blockade, it\u2019s Trump\u2019s immigration policy. What\u2019s more, Hagerman certainly doesn\u2019t oppose informational egress from the central entity in his blockade (which is him) because, as I mentioned, he gave an interview to the New York Times. It seems like he wants other people\u2019s attention while simultaneously withholding his own. \u201cWatch me ignore stuff!\u201d is the pitch.\n\nHowever, leaving aside my cynicism about how Hagerman advocates his approach, the approach itself is tremendously attractive. The NYT interviewer touched upon criticism it had received in a way that, to me, merely encapsulated its appeal: \u201cTo avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people\u2026 cannot afford.\u201d I mean, why not just liken it to a holiday in the Maldives? A lobster dinner? A dishwasher? Yes, not everybody can afford it: for many, ignoring the news is impossible because it affects them directly \u2013 just as, for many, buying a dishwasher is impossible. But does that mean, if you can, you shouldn\u2019t?\n\nProbably. In an ideal world. But you\u2019d need to have ignored the news for a very long time to be willing to believe that\u2019s what Earth is. Capitalism is pretty horrible, but the various attempts at improving on it have either led to totalitarianism or gradually eroded back into capitalism. Or, in the case of modern China, both.\n\nObviously, people are much more likely to get slagged off for ignoring current affairs than for buying dishwashers. And that\u2019s appropriately capitalistic: keeping up with the news, like buying a dishwasher, involves purchasing stuff. Or, when it doesn\u2019t, it involves being sold: allowing the fact that you\u2019ve looked at something to be marketed to advertisers or worse. Either way, it\u2019s economic activity. However, ignoring the news doesn\u2019t add to the GDP and so, unlike other luxuries that do more tangible harm (eg air travel or golf), it can be widely condemned without commercial risk.\n\nErik Hagerman himself broadly goes along with this consensus: \u201cIt makes me a crappy citizen,\u201d he says of the Blockade. \u201cIt\u2019s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.\u201d He has been pouring his energies into an ecological project instead \u2013 he\u2019s bought 45 acres of former mine workings that he hopes to develop into a public park \u2013 and the New York Times interprets this as an atonement.\n\nOver the past few weeks, while not having to find subjects for columns, my own attitude to reading the news has become (to adapt Hagerman\u2019s unsatisfactory blockade metaphor) a medium-strength raft of sanctions. I\u2019ve kept half an eye on events, just in case I suddenly have to stock up on water purification tablets and look for a defensible cave, but no more than half. And I\u2019ve loved the comparative calm of it, feel no guilt whatsoever and have no intention of paying for some penitential local swings.\n\nI think I\u2019ll always value a vague sense of what seems to be generally going on \u2013 the alternative would feel like a denial of society. But the way the news reaches us these days, with so much of it either \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cbreaking\u201d, is worse than ignorance. It\u2019s a decontextualised screech that monetises its ability to catch our attention, but takes no responsibility for advancing our understanding or avoiding disproportionate damage to our peace of mind.\n\nIt\u2019s a barrage of human pain and tragedy, which our brains are not evolved to process without either retreating into a carapace of indifference, or perpetually experiencing the kind of trauma previously reserved for medieval villagers witnessing the Black Death. And it\u2019s also up-to-the-minute micro-snippets of information about events, the real significance of which will only become evident in many weeks\u2019, months\u2019 or years\u2019 time; it\u2019s like trying to assemble a 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle of Satan\u2019s face by being given one piece every hour, each one accompanied by a bone-rattling fanfare.\n\nUnder capitalism, current affairs are presented like this because it makes economic sense. The media generate money by getting our attention and we grant it most reliably not in response to the accurate, illuminating and proportionate, but to the loud, sensational and frightening. That\u2019s a problem we can only solve by ignoring it.", "author": ["David Mitchell"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-cars-and-drivers-more-haste-less-speed", "published": "2018-03-25T18:06:09", "title": "The Guardian view on cars and drivers: more haste less speed | Editorial", "text": "The internal combustion engine has changed the world as much as almost any other invention of the last 150 years. The car has reshaped our cities and colonised our imaginations. It seems to offer autonomy for everyone. There is something almost delightful in the buoyant detachment from reality of advertisements showing mass-produced cars, almost all impossible for any but obsessives to tell apart, marketed as symbols of individuality and of freedom when most of their lives will be spent making short journeys on choked roads.\n\nFor all the fuss made about top speeds, cornering ability and acceleration, the most useful widgets on a modern car are those which work when you\u2019re going very slowly indeed: parking sensors, sound systems, and navigation apps which will show a way around upcoming traffic jams. This seems to be one of the few areas where the benefit of sharing personal information comes straight back to the sharer: because Google knows where almost all its users are, and how fast they are moving almost all the time, it can spot traffic congestion very quickly and suggest ways round it.\n\nThe problem comes when everyone is using a smartphone which tells them to avoid everyone else with a smartphone. Traffic jams abound where no one has enough information to avoid them. When a lucky few have access to the knowledge, they will benefit greatly. But when everyone has perfect information, traffic jams simply spread onto the side roads that seem to offer a way round them. This is exactly what the tragedy of the commons would predict, and now there is research to show that it is actually happening.\n\nThis new congestion teaches us two things. The first is that the promises of technology will never be realised as fully as we hope; they will be limited by their unforeseen and unintended consequences. Sitting in a more comfortable car in a different traffic jam is pleasant \u2013 or at least less unpleasant than life was in the dark ages before smartphones \u2013 but hardly the liberation that once seemed to be promised. The second is that self-organisation will not get us where we want to go. The invisible hand does not straighten out the world, but knots it up more tightly. The efforts of millions of drivers to get ahead do not miraculously produce a situation in which everyone does better than before, but one in which almost everyone does rather worse. Central control and collective organisation can produce smoother and fairer outcomes, though even that much is never guaranteed.\n\nSimilar limits can be foreseen for the much greater advances promised by self-driving cars. Last week, one operated by Uber struck and killed a woman pushing her bicycle across a wide road in Arizona. This was the first recorded death involving a car which was supposed to be fully autonomous. (An earlier fatal crash killed the driver of a Tesla Model S car that was on semi-autonomous autopilot mode.) Experts have said that it suggests a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d of technology, and have noted that the human \u201csafety driver\u201d in the car did not appear to have been monitoring the road in automatically recorded video.\n\nIncreasingly, even Silicon Valley is having to acknowledge the costs of the intoxicating hurry that characterises its culture. When these appear only on balance sheets, they are easily written off as externalities, but when that momentum is translated into the physical world, the costs are higher.

The tech giants have the same sort of monopoly power that Standard Oil once had (Google and Facebook accounted for two-thirds of online advertising spending in the US last year and Amazon was responsible for 75% of online book sales). Mark Zuckerberg might wear chinos rather than the top hat sported by Rockefeller but a robber baron is a robber baron. It is time for anti-trust legislation to be used to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon.\n\nThe charge sheet is a long one: the tech giants are exploiting their monopoly power to stifle competition; they are spreading fake news; their fantastically rich owners portray themselves as right-on yet go to a great deal of trouble to minimise their corporate tax bills; they are ripping the heart out of communities through the closure of bricks-and-mortar retailers. To the list can now be added (in Facebook\u2019s case) the harvesting of the personal data of 50 million Americans and its use for political purposes.\n\nNo question, Big Tech is more vulnerable to a backlash from Washington than it has ever been. Companies have outgrown management systems that were not designed for systemically important businesses and have used their market power to gobble up rivals. It is this charge \u2013 that the disruptive startup companies of yesteryear are today\u2019s anti-capitalists \u2013 that creates the biggest risk of anti-trust action.\n\n\n\nTimeline Big oil and the US government Show Hide\n\nStandard Oil broken up Standard Oil\u2019s monopoly is broken up by the US supreme court. The trust which had been set up by John D Rockefeller in 1882, had gained control of nearly 90% of US oil production. Oil industry gets close to government during war The US joins the first world war and supplies allied forces with oil. President Woodrow Wilson appoints multiple oil executives to war-effort committees and nationalises the railways. API created Brought together by the war, oil executives form a trade body, the American Petroleum Institute (API) in 1919. Ten years later, another trade association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) is formed to represent smaller companies. Second world war starts During the second world war, the US government worked closely with the oil industry, putting a federal investigation into its monopolistic practices on hold. A peacetime version of a wartime committee becomes the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that exists today.\n\nGlobal warming warning API hosts renowned nuclear physicist Edward Teller at a conference at Columbia University, where he warns of impending global warming. President Johnson warns of global warning Lyndon B Johnson is the first US president to publicly acknowledge climate change, calling it a serious global threat during a speech. CO2 warning Scientists at the Stanford Research Institute deliver reports to API, warning of global warming induced by CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. EPA created President Nixon signs an executive order creating the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). CO2 research by Exxon starts Exxon starts an internal climate research programme on carbon dioxide. Ozone standards weakened The EPA relaxes the standard for ozone, which contributes to smog. The move angers environmentalists and industry alike. API sues the agency. Nasa scientist gives evidence Nasa scientist James E Hansen testifies before Congress that the planet is warming because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. Kyoto Protocol signed The Kyoto protocol treaty is signed. Countries pledge to reduce greenhouse gases and recognise the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and is likely caused by fossil fuel emissions. Paris accord signed Some 195 countries back the Paris climate agreement, pledging efforts to reduce emissions and curb global warming. Trump announces US exit from Paris President Trump announces the US exit from the Paris climate agreement, citing industry-hired economists that call the accord a bad deal for US businesses. Supporting the move is Scott Pruitt, a climate-change sceptic, who Trump appointed to head the EPA.\n\nThose who have Facebook, Google and Amazon in their sights can draw on Adam Smith for support. In the bible of modern capitalism, the Wealth of Nations, Smith said: \u201cTo widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it.\u201d Excessive market power, in other words, is bad because it thwarts progress. Old established businesses can see off potential rivals even though the new entrants might have new and better ways of doing things.\n\nThis concept, that Facebook et al are anti-capitalist, explains why the pressure for anti-trust action against them is coming from both right and left \u2013 from Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, as well as from the leading Democrat Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s said, much of the innovation that blossomed in Silicon Valley was the result of the breakup of the telephone company AT&T in 1982. AT&T saw off challengers by deciding what equipment could be used on its national network: Google does the same by using algorithms to decide what comes up on an internet search. Without government action, there was no real prospect of AT&T\u2019s stranglehold being broken and the same applies today given the market dominance of the big tech giants.\n\nThe reality is that breaking up Facebook, Google and Amazon would not be as simple as their critics think. America\u2019s anti-trust legislation is tightly defined and there is no provision for action simply because a company is deemed to be too big. What counts is whether size is being exploited to damage consumer interests.\n\nThat\u2019s going to be tricky to prove. Consumers get Google and Facebook for free, while Amazon offers books \u2013 and an array of other goods \u2013 at a discount. Nor can it be said the companies are failing to invest in new products: all three companies devote an impressive share of their turnover to R&D.\n\nActually, of course, consumers are not getting Google and Facebook for free. They don\u2019t have to part with hard cash but they have to accept that their online activities will be constantly monitored so that advertisers \u2013 commercial or political \u2013 can tailor ads personally for them. People are now waking up to the terms of this Faustian bargain, which is why there will be calls for a change in US competition policy to make anti-trust action easier to prosecute.\n\nThis would require an ideological shift. Americans think the reason they have a Facebook, a Google and an Amazon and the Europeans don\u2019t is that they have a more relaxed attitude towards companies growing big and powerful. The US sees winner-takes-all markets as the law of the capitalist jungle; the EU sees them as an intrinsic threat to consumers.\n\nA twin-track approach \u2013 tougher regulation of Big Tech with the threat of anti-trust action if it doesn\u2019t comply \u2013 looks likelier than an immediate recourse to breakup. There are echoes here of the financial crash of a decade ago. Back then, there were calls for a new Glass Steagall act to break up the banks into retail and investment arms, as was the case from the 1930s to the 1990s. It didn\u2019t happen. The banks expressed regret and then used their considerable lobbying power to head off or water down the threat of radical reform. Politicians talked a lot tougher than they eventually acted. They should be careful not to make the same mistake again.\n\n", "author": ["Larry Elliott", "Emily Bell"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-elections-in-egypt-two-candidates-no-real-choice", "published": "2018-03-25T18:17:18", "title": "The Guardian view on elections in Egypt: two candidates, no real choice | Editorial", "text": "On Monday the polls will open in Egypt so that voters can elect their president. The results are not in doubt: barring some truly staggering development, President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi will begin his second term. That too should have a certain outcome, ending in his departure from office under the constitution\u2019s two-term limit. Will it?\n\nThis is a meaningful election in the same way that the 2013 power seizure that brought Mr Sisi to the top was not a coup. The truth is obvious; the question is whether it is more convenient for some to ignore it. As in the 2014 election, he faces a single opponent \u2013 in the loosest sense. Mousa Mostafa Mousa, a vocal supporter of Mr Sisi until his abrupt decision to stand, told one interviewer that he was \u201cnot here to challenge the president\u201d. Most assume, despite his denials, that he is running solely to lend a veneer of credibility to events. Five other candidates have been jailed or otherwise taken out of contention. Rights organisations have denounced the contest as farcical, warning that Egypt is in the grips of the worst human rights crisis in decades. Mr Sisi\u2019s recent claim that he wished he faced more challengers suggests only a hitherto undiscovered sense of humour. But there is nothing funny about the ruthless crushing of dissent since the army overthrew the elected Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi (now in jail), and massacred hundreds of his supporters.\n\nThe new order has proved more repressive than even Hosni Mubarak\u2019s hated regime, forced out by Arab spring protests after three decades. That permitted a certain level of discussion because it believed it safer to let people vent frustrations; the new order appears to have concluded that tolerating any opposition is dangerous. There are tens of thousands of political prisoners and executions have risen sharply. A growing media crackdown has seen journalists detained and jailed; this weekend it emerged that a British reporter had been arrested and expelled.\n\nWhile there is still popular support for Mr Sisi\u2019s strongman rule, albeit perhaps reflecting the desire for stability after turbulence, the election will tell us little about the Egyptian people\u2019s will. It has, however, exposed tensions in the military and security establishment, including via the failed attempts of the former senior military officers Ahmed Shafik and Sami Anan to stand. One complaint is the concentration of power. Since October, the regime has replaced the military chief of staff, the head of national security and the intelligence chief. Opponents have been beaten down.\n\nMr Sisi\u2019s path has been smoothed by the political course of his international patrons, notably the US, UAE and Saudi Arabia. Egypt\u2019s size and location have long been an advantage; now too it is regarded as essential to the fight against Islamic State \u2013 despite the grave concerns about the rising toll of violence in northern Sinai, which has been under emergency law since 2014 \u2013 and European leaders see it as vital to curbing migration. In a new report, Transparency International warns that western states and arms companies have contributed to the Egyptian military\u2019s consolidation of power through aid and security assistance with minimal conditions.\n\nThe real question now is how long Mr Sisi stays in power. Supporters have called for the lifting of term limits (as happened last month in China); others have suggested extending the four-year terms. There might well be internal disquiet at such a shift. It might, too, galvanise broader opposition in Egypt. Could it be enough to prompt compliant western governments to push back? It should be.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/steve-smith-must-go-australia-jason-gillespie", "published": "2018-03-25T17:45:09", "title": "Steve Smith must go after scandal that has torched Australia\u2019s reputation", "text": "Steve Smith\u2019s time as Australia\u2019s captain is surely up.

The events over the weekend have exposed this as rank hypocrisy.\n\nIt is little wonder the fallout has been so huge and sympathy for Australia has been in such short supply. Because for all the good cricket played in this series against South Africa \u2013 and we are watching two excellent sides \u2013 the atmosphere has stunk and it has made the viewing less enjoyable than it should be.\n\nIs the Baggy Green tarnished as a result of this?

It is down to Sutherland and his colleagues to get to the bottom of who knew what and when. Going on their response to date \u2013 and the fact the prime minister of Australia has been in contact \u2013 one would expect no stone to be left unturned.\n\nSome may say that all teams try to get the ball to reverse and point to the law that imposes only five penalty runs.

It kicked off with Balagu\u00e9 lobbing up a soft one, asking England\u2019s manager what album he would choose to keep if he could listen to only one.\n\nRather than just doing the decent thing and saying, yeah, I listen to Drake in the car, Southgate went on to talk \u2013 for absolutely ages \u2013 about how lucky he was to have been in so many dressing rooms, to have been exposed to different kinds of music, different genres and cultures.\n\n\u201cYes OK, but what album?\u201d Guillem cut in, not giving it up. \u201cWell,\u201d Gareth mused, dwelling a bit more on his recent experience of new music through the younger generation, how varied the cultural palate is, how diverse and multilayered, before concluding, \u201cI guess I\u2019d have to say The Joshua Tree by U2.\u201d\n\nAs moments of endearingly David Brent-style comedy go, this made for a good start to an interesting interview. But it also seemed to chime with the wider sense in Southgate-era England of a lot of carefully managed chatter, a place of DNA and cultures and multifaceted whatnot, all set against the same rather careful stadium-rock football.\n\nOr perhaps not. Gareth and The Joshua Tree also came to mind, briefly, as the team for Friday night\u2019s friendly against the Netherlands was announced. The current England squad is a mixed affair, with plenty of outsiders, form horses, and many who have reached this level via the road less travelled. Could it be that England really are about to set off for a major tournament with a team made up of left-field cuts and indie favourites?\n\nIn the event the opposite happened in Amsterdam. This was instead a Joshua Tree of a team, compromised entirely of mainstream, platinum-selling parts. All 10 outfield players were drawn from clubs in the last 16 of the Champions League. Every player had spent some part of his youth at a Premier League-or-equivalent academy. Only two Englishman over the age of 27 touched the ball all night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jesse Lingard takes control of the ball in the Amsterdam Arena. Photograph: Phil Duncan/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThere has been an understandable urge to play down the import of a 1-0 win away to a poor Dutch team, who had only three Champions League players of their own on the pitch. Two years ago England beat the world champions and the current European champions as part of their preparations for being humiliated by Iceland at the European Championship.\n\nBut there are also times when credit is due for the methodology as much as the endgame. This was in its own way a process realised, a case of Peak Gareth. Win or lose, this team puts to the test the structures and tactics incubated at St George\u2019s Park, via Premier League academies and Southgate\u2019s own under-21 group.\n\nThere were plenty of coherent elements. It was striking to hear Ronald Koeman, who knows a bit about elite winning teams, say that England had been more comfortable on the ball. It is a significant cultural shift, and a genuine departure after decades spent watching England teams for whom the ball has so often appeared to be square.\n\nSouthgate has instead dropped established international players he feels lack the necessary technical ease to enact his plan of attritional possession from back to front. It would have been easier not to do this, easier not to put Kyle Walker, a player more used to having the ball at his feet, in his back three.\n\nBut Southgate stuck to the blueprint, and his team\u2019s comfort in possession as they reined in the Dutch was his reward. England managers have a history of encouraging selections in friendlies, before reverting to the staid old celebrity parts when the tournament pressures arrive. It is to be hoped Southgate will buck this trend. For all the lack of real starriness there were no weak links here, no hobbling A-listers. Every player in the team was fit and full of running.\n\nSome have lamented the absence of Jack Wilshere, pointing to a preference for athleticism over invention. But Wilshere would have been the odd man out in other ways, too, lacking pace, mobility and power. Plus, of course, football has changed a great deal quite quickly. It is a high-pressure team game now. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain may lack Wilshere\u2019s artistry, may not caress the ball so lovingly or suggest deeper playmaking gears but in between his sprints and hustle he has also scored and made more goals this season.\n\nSimilarly, the attacking three had balance, with no sense of hierarchy or duties too rigidly defined. Marcus Rashford, Jesse Lingard and Raheem Sterling all made runs across the frontline and dropped deep at times. It is often assumed in English football that a tall, muscular centre-forward is the definition of a \u201cplan B\u201d. But interchanging, making different runs, tugging away at the stitches: this is how the best teams vary the point of attack rather than simply tearing up the plan and taking to the skies.\n\nNone of which is to say England are suddenly a top-10 team or that this studied planning is going to hold through the extreme stress of tournament football. But after the DNA, the talk about culture and repeating tactical patterns, this was the closest we have come to an example of Total Gareth. England kept the ball and attacked as a mobile unit. Even the goalkeeper seemed grooved to fit the plan, Jordan Pickford\u2019s control and distribution is well suited if England really do intend to continue this way.\n\nNo doubt someone will expose the weak points in this set of players. The defence will be pressed by stronger teams. The lack of high-grade passing in midfield may be a problem. But it is to be hoped the selection and tactics against Italy at Wembley can keep to the same course, if only for the fascination of seeing a plan, so often talked up, finally start to bite.", "author": ["Barney Ronay"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/mar/25/journeyman-movie-injuries-boxing-ring-paddy-considine", "published": "2018-03-25T15:02:05", "title": "Paddy Considine\u2019s Journeyman is fiction but it has lessons for boxing | Sean Ingle", "text": "There is a scene at the start of Paddy Considine\u2019s compelling new film, Journeyman, about a boxer who suffers brain damage after a world title fight, that rattles the senses like a sharp one-two.\n\nOne moment Considine\u2019s character, Matty Burton, is celebrating retaining the belt with his wife; the next he is dabbing at his head before crashing to the floor unconscious. And, at a stroke, his life\u2019s roulette wheel has spun from glory to tragedy, with no sense it will find equilibrium again.\n\nCan Paddy Considine's Journeyman land a knockout blow for British boxing movies? Read more\n\nThe movie, which is out on Friday, took Considine nearly 10 years to develop and shoot. But it has timed its moment exquisitely. Boxing in Britain is enjoying another of its sporadic golden ages, despite three deaths in the ring in the last five years, and growing research about the dangers of traumatic brain injury across many contact sports.\n\nConsidine\u2019s depiction of a slurring, stumbling former fighter prone to flashes of violence as he tries to rediscover his identity, lingers in the mind. As he explained to me, he wanted to capture not only the bravery of those who put their bodies on the line but \u201cthe fragility of the sport and of life itself \u2013 and what happens when the doors close and the crowds have gone away\u201d.\n\nFrom personal experience, I can vouch that he has succeeded. It was boxing that gave my grandfather, Jimmy, the eldest of 15 children scrapping and scraping by in a two-up, two-down in Dublin, a shot at a better life. It led to titles \u2013 he was the first Irishman to become European amateur champion \u2013 and lasting friendships, including among those who had once tried to take his head off. In truth, he probably prized such camaraderies most of all.\n\nAlong the way he also fought in front of 70,000 people at Soldier Field in Chicago, after which the former world heavyweight champion Gene Tunney offered to manage him (he turned Tunney down because he had given the Englishman Ted Broadribb his word he would sign with him). And he also got to face some of the best fighters of his day, including Randolph Turpin, who went on to beat Sugar Ray Robinson.\n\nBut, long after he had retired, the sport he loved also killed him. Even with 30 years\u2019 distance, it is hard to forget the panic in my father\u2019s eyes. Or the shock and silence after hearing my grandfather had suffered a heart attack when a heavyweight missed the pads he was holding up at the local amateur boxing club and hit him instead.\n\nWhat followed sounds like clich\u00e9. The local newspaper with its front-page headline \u201cBoxing hero dies in the ring\u201d. The obligatory quote from a family member: \u201cBoxing was his life \u2013 he would have chosen to go like this. No blame is being attached to anyone and we feel very sorry for the lad who was training with him.\u201d And everyone moving on, except those involved.\n\nIt is on this difficult terrain that Journeyman pokes and probes. Considine, who prepared for the role by training for 12 weeks at the Ingle Gym in Sheffield (my great-uncle Brendan also has a cameo as his father), admitted to me that he was nervous that his film might be seen as anti-boxing. He needn\u2019t be. Only someone who cared about the sport would depict it so honestly. Journeyman does not glorify boxing or condemn it. It merely recognises its dangers.\n\nNo one can accuse Considine of not doing his due diligence. Before making the film he spoke to Peter McCabe, chief executive of the brain injury charity Headway, who is deeply anti-boxing, as well as surgeons and those with brain injuries.\n\n\u201cSometimes we look at boxing and we forget there are human beings in there \u2013 they become characters in a narrative themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with that separation you sometimes forget there are two men putting their lives at risk.\u201d\n\nI thought of those words on Saturday night as the Australian heavyweight Lucas Browne crashed face-first on the canvas during the sixth round of his fight against Dillian Whyte. It had long been obvious that Browne \u2013 a strong but primitive fighter reminiscent of an early character in a Super Punch Out! \u2013 was in trouble. He was bloodied and blinded, nose busted and physically gassed. Yet he was allowed to continue by his corner and the referee until a cuffing left hook knocked him out for several minutes.\n\nAfterwards some people on social media suggested that Browne still had a puncher\u2019s chance. Perhaps he did. But at some point in the fourth or fifth round, when the chances of him landing that sort of shot became smaller than the risk of being seriously hurt, the fight should have been stopped.\n\nSometimes I wonder whether social media is partly to blame. No one wants to be labelled a coward or a quitter. And so they continue to trudge into the firing line.\n\nThankfully on Sunday Browne tweeted that he was fine, but tellingly he also admitted: \u201cMy eye was giving me trouble from the second and you can\u2019t protect from what you can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nI still maintain that boxing redeems far more lives than it ruins. And I have also seen the power of the salve and salvation that boxing clubs can provide in inner\u2011city communities at first hand. But it is always good to have your prejudices challenged.

I think that at a given moment you must say \u2018stop\u2019 \u2026 There have been some great players who retired in 2000 and 2002, other players are doing it and now I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: The Battle of Santiago | Simon Burnton Read more\n\nAlmost exactly a year later Zidane would use that very same website to announce his return. There had been rumours that he would do so but Zidane had publicly denied them. When asked by L\u2019Equipe for his reaction to the news, Christophe Dugarry, a former World Cup-winning team-mate of Zidane\u2019s, instructed the paper not to run the story as he thought somebody must have hacked the website. There had been no piracy involved, however, Zidane was back. \u201cFor the very first time in my life I have decided to go back on my word which is very important for me,\u201d read his statement. \u201cWhen I made the decision to retire I was very serious \u2013 today I have made the same decision but in reverse.\u201d Zidane had listened to the voice.\n\n\u201cOne night, at 3am, I suddenly woke up and I then spoke with someone,\u201d he said, explaining his reason for coming out of international retirement. \u201cUntil I die I will never tell [who that person was], this is just too crazy. This is someone that you will probably never meet. During the hours that followed I was on my own with that person, at home, and I took the decision to come back. I had never experienced that before, I felt pushed by this force which dictated my behaviour. It was a revelation for me, I had to obey that voice that was advising me.\u201d\n\nThe manager of France, Raymond Domenech, publicly declared himself to be \u201cextremely happy\u201d that Zidane \u2013 as well as Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 and Lilian Thuram \u2013 had decided to come out of retirement and so he should have been. Domenech had done very little to persuade the three players, who had a combined age of 98, to stay on when he took over from Jacques Santini in 2004 but his France side were struggling through World Cup qualification and in need of experienced professionals. The manager looked out of his depth. Writing about France and Zidane\u2019s return for the Observer a year before the tournament, Darren Tullett quoted one French World Cup winner as saying: \u201cDomenech is a prat and we haven\u2019t got a clue what he\u2019s going on about half the time.\u201d\n\nThe results at that stage in the qualification process backed up the player\u2019s claim. France may have been undefeated but there had been too many unconvincing displays in a weak enough group. That was especially true at home where they had racked up scoreless stalemates against Israel, Ireland and Switzerland (Cyprus and the Faroe Islands made up the rest of the group). That left Domenech\u2019s side in fourth place, three points behind the group leaders, Ireland, with just four games to go. Their hopes of making Germany looked set to be dashed. However, with Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, Thuram and Zidane restored to the squad France won three matches, drew the other, finished top of their group and the country could let out a sigh of relief.\n\nThree weeks before the end of La Liga\u2019s 2005-06 season, it was time for another announcement from Zidane. This was it for him. He was done with club and international football for good. \u201cI have to listen to my body and I cannot carry on for another year. I think it is better to clarify the situation now. I have been thinking about it for a long time. It\u2019s been three years since we [Madrid] won anything and in two of those, I\u2019ve not played as I\u2019ve wanted. I am not going to play any better than I have done in the past. I don\u2019t want to just play for Real Madrid for the sake of it.\u201d There would be no more jaw-dropping volleys and there would be more balletic pirouettes, his signature move that left defenders rooted to the ground like an old tree. There would, however, be one last chance of glory on the biggest stage football has to offer.\n\nWhile Spain, Brazil and Portugal all qualified from the group stages with three wins, nine points and the utmost of ease, France recreated their poor form from qualification. Their first match was against Switzerland. Kobi Kuhn\u2019s limited team knew the French only too well and they were able to frustrate their foes at every turn. From little material, Zidane, captaining the team, fashioned his side\u2019s only real opportunities but both were spurned by team-mates. Fires burned, nostrils flared and tempers bubbled. Thuram and William Gallas felt the lash of their captain\u2019s tongue. The match ended in a goalless draw.\n\nFrance\u2019s Zinedine Zidane, left, and Lilian Thuram during the group stage match between France and Switzerland at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nFrance\u2019s next match failed to offer little improvement in terms of result or, indeed, performance. A Thierry Henry goal after nine minutes gave them the lead but South Korea took the game by the scruff of the neck and deserved their point in the 1-1 draw, if not all three.\n\nIn the eyes of the French this was a humiliating result that was made worse by the form of Zidane. \u201cThe way the France captain played,\u201d wrote Michael Walker in the Guardian, \u201che is in danger of being referred to as the once-great Zidane \u2026 this was not the Zidane we will recall or want to recall.\u201d Playing as part of a trio behind Henry, he was \u201cslow and sloppy\u201d, a mere shadow of his former majesty.\n\nDomenech agreed. With three minutes of injury time left and France in search of a winning goal, he took off the three-time winner of the Fifa World Player of the Year award and replaced him with Trezeguet. Unless France beat Togo in their next match that would be the last time that the world would glimpse Zidane at work, a most ignominious exit for a glorious player. He had picked up two yellow cards and was suspended for the next game.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: West Germany 1-0 Austria in 1982 | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nTogo were poor, but it took 55 minutes for France to break them down. Patrick Vieira celebrated his 30th birthday with his fifth goal in 90 appearances before Henry got his second of the tournament to seal the victory. France could have won by more but they were held back by Trezeguet\u2019s lack of confidence and Franck Rib\u00e9ry\u2019s errant finishing. Nonetheless, they were through to the next round, qualifying in second place just ahead of South Korea. They had won their first World Cup match since beating Brazil in the final eight years earlier and they had done it all without Zidane in their side.\n\nSuch had been the midfielder\u2019s wayward performances by that stage of the competition that ahead of the last-16 match against Spain, the Guardian ran a referendum questioning whether Zidane should start. \u201cThe powers of the once imperious midfielder looked to have deserted him \u2026 would Domenech be better to stick to a winning formula to generate much needed momentum?\u201d it asked.\n\nFew who had seen him play would have argued that Zidane deserved to be anything other than a spectator but Domenech disagreed. Zidane would start. Eric Abidal backed his manager\u2019s choice: \u201cZidane will be the difference,\u201d he said. Abidal could never have known how prophetic his words would be but he surely knew how little say his manager had at that point of the tournament.\n\n\u201cDomenech had come into the 2006 World Cup with a masterplan that quickly looked more like a botched strategy devised by someone who didn\u2019t master much, least of all his own players,\u201d wrote Philippe Auclair of L\u2019Equipe in his biography of Thierry Henry, Lonely at the Top. \u201cFrustrated by their incapacity to overcome modest opponents in the group phase, senior members of Domenech\u2019s squad \u2026 decided to take the matter into their own hands and impose self-governance within the French camp. That, at least, is the way in which France\u2019s resurgence from the round of 16 onwards is almost universally explained in my home country.\u201d Zidane, of course, was the most senior of those senior members and he was about to take total control.\n\nWith just seven minutes remaining on the clock and sides drawing 1-1, France won a free kick outside the box. Spain had been very impressive in the group stages and many expected them to finally come good in major tournament (their starting 11 contained eight players who would go on to win Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, and afterwards Henry admitted that \u201cpeople ... thought we were going to get killed against Spain\u201d).\n\nBy this stage in the game, the momentum had seemed to be swinging towards them \u2013 just minutes before Joaqu\u00edn had rifled a shot wide of the post after making a mockery of the France defence. Then up stepped Zidane. His free kick was converted by the head of Vieira. Nine minutes later and two minutes into injury time, with Spain still in search of an equaliser, he picked the ball up wide on the left. Marauding into Spanish territory, he quickly cut inside Carlos Puyol and fired inside Iker Casillas\u2019 near post. He was back and with a bang that could be heard from Paris to Pamplona.\n\nNext up was a date with tournament favourites Brazil. Fifty-six minutes into the game France were awarded a free kick wide on the left when Cafu fouled Florent Malouda. Zidane stood over the ball once again. He spotted that the Brazilian defence had gone to sleep at the back post and aimed for that area. Within moments Henry had put France into the lead and the striker was celebrating with his team-mates.\n\nZidane, however, stood apart from the rest, smiling to himself. Just as with the match against Spain, it was he who separated the two sides. At one stage he held off Kak\u00e1 while juggling the ball and later he would knock it over Ronaldo\u2019s head, making the World Cup winner look like a lost schoolboy searching for his mother. \u201cHe ran the game,\u201d wrote Amy Lawrence for The Observer. \u201cFrom the first moment, when he signalled his intent by carving through the yellow shirts, to the last, when he pushed up front in search of the killer goal. And in between he delivered the most memorable touches, the sweetest moves.\u201d Henry\u2019s goal was enough to win the game for France. They were through to the semi-finals where they would face Portugal.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Ze Roberto, Kaka and Juninho surround Zidane during the 2006 quarter-final.\n\nThose who fail to learn from history are bound to repeat it and Portugal failed to learn. In Euro 2000 they gave away a penalty to lose 2-1 to France in the semi-finals and it happened again in Germany. Henry needed no invitation to hit the ground in the box but an experienced defender such as Ricardo Carvalho should really have known better than to be putting in such a challenge in such a situation. The Portuguese keeper, Ricardo, may have been able to halt England but he could not do the same to Zidane, whose two-step run up and crisp finish had too much power for him to keep out. Zidane\u2019s goal was enough to win the game for France and set up a final with Italy.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: Uruguay's 1950 triumph in Brazil Read more\n\nThe statue that commemorates that moment stands around 16 feet tall, almost three times as high as the two men its story centres on. And yet it could have been all so different. Zidane had given France the lead in the final in the most audacious fashion. There cannot be too many players who would have the confidence and audacity to successfully execute a Panenka in a World Cup final but Zidane did. Deep in extra-time he almost doubled his goal count for the game. Just outside the Italian area, he played the ball to Willy Sagnol out on the right-hand side, before moving through the opposition defence with all the silence and stealth of a spy on a secret mission. Sagnol\u2019s cross was met with a powerful header from his captain that forced Buffon to tip the ball over the bar with a most magnificent save.\n\nThe various videos and angles of the build-up to the headbutt show Materazzi\u2019s mouth moving but his words can only be heard by one person, the one person who matters, the one person Materazzi wants to hear. Despite the scurrilous and evidence-free accusations printed by some newspapers, the defender\u2019s words were not about his opponent\u2019s religion or ethnicity. \u201cI prefer the whore that is your sister,\u201d Materazzi would later admit to saying. It was the sort of schoolboy insult that Zidane, and thousands of other professional footballers, must have heard from fans, and indeed fellow players, on a regular basis. Something, however, snapped that evening in Berlin and in Zidane. All the beauty and brilliance of his play in the knockout stages melted away and what was left was his anger and aggression. \u201cI tried not to listen to him but he repeated them several times,\u201d said Zidane. \u201cSometimes words are harder than blows. When he said it for the third time, I reacted.\u201d\n\nZidane had already taken some steps past the Italian defender when the red mist descended like a fog on Dickensian London. He lent forward, lowered his head and rutted like a deer in mating season. Afterwards, his opponent clutched the ground and his chest like a drunk their last bottle. Zidane\u2019s stare communicates his sheer contempt for Materazzi and his words. \u201cI would have rather been knocked down than hear that,\u201d he said. Pandemonium then took hold on and off the pitch and within moments Zidane was gone. Perhaps the most iconic image of 2006 World Cup is not the dark-eyed Zidane standing over a stricken Materazzi but the picture of the solitary Zidane walking past the glistening World Cup trophy on his way back to the dressing room. So near and yet so far.\n\nZidane looks up during the World Cup final.\n\nAfter his goodbye speech in the dressing-room to his retiring captain was done, Domenech began the applause, but \u201cthere was only the grinding of teeth\u201d the French manager said. \u201cCertain players really hated their captain.\u201d They were not the only ones who were dismayed and disappointed by Zidane\u2019s actions. Le Figaro called his head-butt \u201codious\u201d while L\u2019Equipe\u2019s front page asked: \u201cWhat should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?\u201d Frank Leboeuf, meanwhile, described himself as \u201cashamed\u201d by the actions of his former team-mate.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: Cameroon shock Argentina in 1990 Read more\n\nZidane could have been forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation upon his return to France. He would have been aware of the reception that greeted his Real Madrid team-mate David Beckham after he arrived back in England in 1998 following his sending-off against Argentina. France, however, was different. There was no need for armed guards and there was burning of Zidane effigies. Instead, the Place de la Concorde was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting \u201cZizou! Zizou!\u201d like monks in a monastery worshipping a higher power.\n\nJacques Chirac, the president of France, led the tributes. \u201cThe match you played last night was full of talent and professionalism,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that you are sad and disappointed but what I want to tell you is that the whole country is extremely proud of you. You have honoured the country with your exceptional qualities and your fantastic fighting spirit, which was your strength in difficult times, but also in winning times.\u201d\n\nChirac\u2019s words may have seemed to be a touch excessive but they reflected what the people wanted to hear. Polls done in the immediate wake of the incident backed up the public shows of support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them.\n\nHis bones had ached, his form had dipped but Zidane managed to conjure up a final, extended piece of magic to woo the world. His performances after the group stages, according to Auclair, \u201cranked among his finest in a blue shirt\u201d. Not many would argue against that.\n\nBefore the tournament, few in France could have hoped that the team would come within a penalty shoot-out of winning but Zidane had given them hope. \u201cFor a month, France was dreaming with Zidane\u201d wrote Lib\u00e9ration but that dream was dashed the moment Materazzi opened his mouth and Zidane turned to face him. And yet the people of France would not let that moment of madness tarnish all that he had given them throughout his career. As one French writer said at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.\u201d\n\nWhat the Guardian wrote: Italy strike gold as Zidane sees red\n\nBy Kevin McCarra, Berlin, 10 July 2006\n\nItaly are world champions, with a flawless set of penalties in the shoot-out securing football\u2019s ultimate prize. They had never been undisputed masters in any other aspect of the final, yet the honour is theirs for the fourth time in their history. The veterans of France, tapping unimaginable reserves of stamina, had been more potent from the opening of the second-half onwards but are now submerged in the miseries of their leader.\n\nA red card rather than a greetings card ushered Zinedine Zidane into retirement 19 minutes into extra-time. The captain was sent off for reacting to a dispute with Marco Materazzi by turning and butting the scorer of Italy\u2019s goal in the chest. He had surely been provoked - there were suggestions last night that Materazzi had called him \u201ca terrorist\u201d - but Zidane will be right to curse his stupid reaction.\n\nThis World Cup had come to mean too much to him and the dismissal followed three bookings in his six matches here. The 34-year-old was as overwrought as any testosterone-maddened youngster but could still have contrived a triumph. Five minutes before his expulsion he was unmarked to connect with Willy Sagnol\u2019s cross 12 yards out but his header was tipped over by Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nGoalkeepers had little to do, even if the final was diverting and often classy. Buffon might as well have been a bystander in the shoot-out, since a Juventus team-mate David Trezeguet bashed his penalty against the bar. The left-back Fabio Grosso secured victory for Italy from the spot.\n\nOne of the worst aspects of the sudden-death system is that it leaves the losers tormenting themselves over each detail that might have been different. Thierry Henry, affected for a while by a first-minute head knock, had a splendid, free-running spell after the interval and compelled Buffon to an important stop. The coach Raymond Domenech, though, was eventually to substitute him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest TV grabs shows the ill-fated moment. Photograph: A9999 DB WDR/EPA\n\nBy then Henry was exhausted but his removal meant that neither he nor Zidane could face Buffon in the shoot-out. The veteran, in a rather erratic fashion, had illustrated at the very start of the night that he could beat the goalkeeper. After six minutes Henry headed into the area from the left and Florent Malouda went down as Materazzi closed on him.\n\nThere had seemed to be a slight contact, enough to meet the referee Horacio Elizondo\u2019s criteria. Plotting the penalty, Zidane almost baffled himself in the battle of wits. He had scored the single goal of the semi-final against Portugal from the spot by hitting a sharp, low finish to the goalkeeper\u2019s right. Here, confronted by his former Juventus colleague Buffon, he opted for the opposite.\n\nThe ball was floated the other way, where it caught the underside of the crossbar and dropped over the line. There was a suspicion then that luck would rally to Zidane \u2018s aid with the total fulfilment of his life as a footballer. Minds turned to the symmetry of his impact, considering that he had delivered an opener, too, when France took the 1998 World Cup in Paris.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: Pickles the dog is a very good boy in 1966 | Scott Murray Read more\n\nThe harmonies of history were, in practice, to take another shape entirely. Italy had never before conquered on penalties in the World Cup finals and were even vanquished by France in that fashion at the quarter-final stage eight years ago. A nation famed for its icy efficiency was bound to put that right sooner or later.\n\nFrance had made Italy turn into a former incarnation of themselves. The manager Marcello Lippi has been encouraging a more expressive style but that had been of sporadic worth. Not even the loss of Patrick Vieira in the second half, to a hamstring injury, halted the rising assertiveness of Domenech\u2019s players.\n\nLippi would be driven to bolster his midfield with the introduction of Daniele de Rossi, who came fresh from a four-game ban for elbowing the United States forward Brian McBride in the face. The manager was reacting to circumstances then, but had evidently conducted a measured examination of the France back four beforehand.\n\nMaterazzi equalised by overpowering Vieira to meet an Andrea Pirlo corner on 19 minutes and smash a header into the net. France\u2019s discomfort at set pieces was never eased and, when Francesco Totti released Luca Toni for an effort that was blocked, Domenech\u2019s team faced another corner. Pirlo flighted it once more and, on this occasion, it was Toni who won the header but hit the crossbar.\n\nThe long-serving France players did understand how to regroup and not long after the interval the Italy right-back Gianluca Zambrotta ran a serious risk with his challenge on Malouda. The argument for a penalty was stronger than it had been at the opening of the evening, yet the ref eree was reluctant to grant a second for an offence on the same player.\n\nThe changes of personnel made by a perturbed Lippi were nearly followed by a breakthrough. The dead-ball expert Pirlo piloted one more free-kick and Toni can have been off-side by only a fraction as he headed the ball past Barthez.\n\nThere will be no regrets for any Italian in the return to supremacy of their national team, following the ignominy of early exits at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, but this was not exactly the culmination that had been anticipated. Lippi\u2019s team, overall, has been the best in this tournament but recognition of that is muddled by admiration for the pluck that France showed and sadness that Zidane should have left the stage in such a dismal manner.", "author": ["Ian Mccourt"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/25/steven-reid-roy-hodgson-crystal-palace-first-team-coach-republic-of-ireland", "published": "2018-03-25T17:08:12", "title": "Steven Reid: \u2018Roy Hodgson is an inspiration \u2013 working with him fits perfectly\u2019 | Ed Aarons", "text": "The former Republic of Ireland midfielder learned much from the former England manager during his playing career and is learning even more now as Hodgson\u2019s first-team coach at Crystal Palace\n\nSteven Reid winces. \u201cWe had a staff game yesterday so I\u2019m feeling the effects a little bit. I\u2019ve probably played twice in the last six months when we\u2019ve been short of players. Actually the gaffer has been quite complimentary \u2013 playing that game yesterday I was thinking: \u2018Tell you what \u2026\u2019 But you wake up the next morning and you know that\u2019s just wishful thinking.\u201d\n\nA little more than 18 months after calling time on a career during which he underwent no fewer than 10 operations and racked up a more than a decade\u2019s service in the Premier League as well as a World Cup finals appearance for Republic of Ireland, the former Millwall, Blackburn, West Brom and Burnley player has settled into the next phase of his career. Whereas most players hang up their boots without a plan about what to do next, it is no accident that Reid finds himself learning his new trade as Crystal Palace\u2019s first-team coach under the tutelage of the former England manager Roy Hodgson.\n\nRoy Hodgson: \u2018Coaching is a sadistic pleasure \u2013 the suffering never stops\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cThe original plan was to join the coaching staff under Steve Clarke at West Brom but I went on to have another season at Burnley,\u201d Reid says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a career that had great moments all the way through \u2013 for about five years I was probably about 50% to 60% of what I was when I had that season at Blackburn under Mark Hughes when we finished sixth. Most family photos I look through now I\u2019ve got an ice pack on my knee. When I suffered my cruciate injury, that was the moment that my career almost took another path. I knew I needed to make a plan and that\u2019s when my coaching journey began.\u201d\n\nThe chronic pain caused by his injuries meant the all-action midfielder who had burst through Millwall\u2019s youth setup under Billy Bonds was forced to adapt to a new position in defence in his latter years. But it was his conversations with Hodgson and then Clarke while at West Brom that convinced Reid to pursue a new goal. \u201cIn the last two or three years you almost become a coach on the pitch anyway as a senior player. Roy was an inspiration. It was a great time to be there. We have always had a very professional relationship.\u201d\n\nWhen Hodgson called six weeks after Reid decided to leave his first coaching post, at Reading last summer, he had no hesitation in accepting. \u201cRoy wanted a young coach alongside him and it all just seems to fit perfectly. We have chats about all sorts of things. A lot of what he says goes over my head because he\u2019s reading books and watching films that I\u2019ve never heard of. We had a discussion last week about the languages he can speak \u2013 he learned French at school and then picked up Swedish early on in his career. A bit of German, Italian \u2026 and he makes it sound so easy: \u2018Three or four months and I\u2019ve got it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have a good bit of banter because of my age and the gaffer\u2019s age. We can give each other a bit of stick. Often the perception with people who have not worked with him is massively different to the man that he is: still the most enthusiastic person that I\u2019ve met in the game.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steven Reid issues instructions from the touchline as first-team coach at Crystal Palace. Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThat enthusiasm has certainly rubbed off on his apprentice. At 37 Reid is much closer in age to the majority of Palace\u2019s players and often acts as a conduit between them and the manager, although he insists he is no pushover. \u201cThere comes a point where you have to be firm with the players and tell the truth,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment there\u2019s no time frame for the future \u2013 I know I\u2019m lucky enough to be in this position now. If you look too far ahead you can come unstuck. You\u2019re talking about 92 league clubs, so that means 92 assistants and probably half that for first-team coaches. It\u2019s a difficult position to get into but I like to pride myself on doing things right, like I did when I was a player.\u201d\n\nWith Chris Hughton the only manager in the Premier League from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background, does Reid believe the adoption of the Rooney Rule by the Football Association and Football League is necessary? \u201cObviously there is a problem when you look at the number of black players compared to the number in coaching or administration, particularly at the top end. It doesn\u2019t make sense. I think the Rooney Rule is a good thing but we also need the numbers to make it work. It can\u2019t just be an interview for an interview\u2019s sake. We need more and more numbers getting into top-flight positions \u2013 not just coaching, but administration and those that are making decisions \u2013 to take us to that next level.\u201d\n\nReid is halfway through his Uefa Pro-Licence course and pauses for a moment when asked whether he is the only BAME candidate. \u201cThere\u2019s me, Jason Euell ... you\u2019ve got me thinking now. So it\u2019s a very small percentage of the group. Unfortunately most people who come out of the game can\u2019t afford \u00a36,000 for your A licence and another \u00a38,500 for your Pro Licence.\n\n\u201cThere is funding for BAME candidates from the PFA so perhaps more needs to be done to make people more aware of that. But the bottom line is that there has to be a desire to do it because it is hard work. If I can in a small way influence some of the black players who play under me to think, \u2018Actually, there\u2019s a path forward for me in this coaching game\u2019, then that\u2019s got to be positive.\u201d\n\nThe only relegation of Reid\u2019s career came in his final season with Burnley and he is confident Palace can avoid it this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that we can compete with the best in the league, so hopefully we can end the season in a good way.\u201d", "author": ["Ed Aarons"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/gambling-commission-recommendations-siginificant-impact-online-punters-horse-racing", "published": "2018-03-25T16:11:00", "title": "Gambling Commission recommendations may have significant impact on punters", "text": "Online gambling firms can expect to receive close attention from the regulator during the coming months in areas such as account restrictions and closures\n\nWhen the Gambling Commission published its long-awaited review of gaming machines and social responsibility measures last week, the final document ran to nearly 50,000 words.\n\nYet the news reports and analysis that followed concentrated almost exclusively on a number, \u00a330, which was taken by some at least to be the Commission\u2019s recommendation for the new maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).\n\nGambling watchdog fails to curb fixed-odds betting stakes to \u00a32 Read more\n\nOn closer inspection, it was no such thing.

But the understandable focus on FOBT stakes diverted attention from a long list of warnings and recommendations in the remainder of the review which could prove to be equally significant, if not more so, for the average punter.\n\nOnline gambling firms, in particular, can expect to receive close attention from the regulator in the months ahead. In areas such as account restrictions and closures, \u201cdormancy\u201d fees, hiding behind unfair T&Cs and retaining stakes while refusing to pay winnings, some firms are notorious among punters for carrying on as though they can do as they please. A final showdown is far from imminent, but a close reading of the review does at least suggest that Wyatt Earp has checked in to the Tombstone saloon.\n\nOne example is that the current regime which allows punters to open an account, fund it and start gambling in less than five minutes seems most unlikely to survive. Instead, gambling firms will be required to know a great deal more about their customers before taking their money, and may also be required to set a limit on their deposits and stakes that corresponds to the information that has been provided.\n\nIn addition to making it more difficult for problem gamblers to bet with stolen money, this could also have a knock-on effect on high\u2011staking winning punters, who can get their bets on only by resorting to multiple alias accounts. The days when a bookie takes a 25\u2011grand bet from a 19-year-old student and starts asking questions only when they are looking at a \u00a31m payout could be drawing to a close.\n\nThere is also a strong hint in the review that gambling on credit is on borrowed time, and a clear sign that the complete absence of staking limits when it comes to online gaming will also be addressed. \u201cThis position looks increasingly anomalous,\u201d the review says. \u201cIt is vital that the remote sector demonstrates that the risks associated with remote gambling are being managed effectively and comprehensively. If they fail to do so, the case for imposing controls on stakes and prizes comparable to those on gambling products posing similar risks in the land-based sectors will be very strong.\u201d\n\nOne issue which did not get a mention in the Commission\u2019s review \u2013 since it was outside its scope \u2013 is the account restrictions and closures that continue to plague many punters betting on racing and other sports.\n\nThey are the backers who fall into the wide gap between purely recreational punters \u2013 who are not price conscious \u2013 and full-time professionals looking to stake five-figure sums.\n\nHere too, though, the mood music seems quite positive. Representatives of punters\u2019 groups met with senior Gambling Commission officials on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a minimum bet limit becoming a requirement of a bookmaker\u2019s operating licence, and apparently left believing that it will, at some point, become a reality.\n\nBack in the retail sector, betting shop staff will be delighted that the review suggests single-staffing of betting offices is inappropriate to an environment which includes FOBTs.\n\n\u201cAppropriate staffing levels are key to the detection and mitigation of harmful play,\u201d it says. \u201cThere must be serious doubt about the extent to which a single member of staff on their own in a betting shop, even at less busy times of the day or night, can simultaneously look after the counter, remain alert to the possibility of under-age play and money laundering and still be expected to identify potentially harmful play and make appropriate interventions.\u201d The warning for retail firms that use single-staffing in shops until long into the evening is clear.\n\nAs for the eventual maximum stake for FOBTs, that is for Hancock to decide. The review does, however, open up a potential new line of attack for opponents of the machines should the minister cave in to industry pressure and duck a \u00a32 limit.\n\nRoulette, it makes clear, is \u201cby far the most popular game\u201d on FOBTs, and also the one which would be most affected by a \u00a32 limit, as players tend to spread their stakes across several bets on every spin of the wheel. A \u00a32 maximum per spin could mean that \u201croulette would no longer be a commercially viable product\u201d.\n\nBut the fact that it produces a pressurised \u2013 almost frantic \u2013 staking pattern in a high-speed environment could be seen as a good reason why roulette, at least, demands tighter regulation than other casino-type games.\n\nLike bookmaking, roulette\u2019s origins date to the late 18th century, but for almost all of that time, the two went their separate ways. An amendment to the Gambling Act to restrict roulette to casinos would find supporters on all sides of the House.", "author": ["Greg Wood"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/25/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-error-australian-grand-prix-formula-onef1", "published": "2018-03-25T18:00:00", "title": "Lewis Hamilton rues Mercedes error that cost Australian Grand Prix win", "text": "Lewis Hamilton said he would prefer to trust his racer\u2019s instinct rather than instruction from his Mercedes team after they admitted it was likely a software error cost him victory in the opening grand prix of the season in Australia.\n\nHamilton was passed by Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel when the German took a pit stop after the virtual safety car had been deployed.

In them he learned that not only had his beloved mother been an agent for the state, she\u2019d also been spying on her own family\u2026\n\nI was once, aged 22, invited for a series of interviews by the British secret service. The interviews, designed to assess my suitability for espionage, took place in a blacked-out room in central London. I was intrigued by the process, somewhat flattered by the approach, but then at the end of the interviews came the moment of truth \u2013 or, more exactly, the moment of duplicity. I was invited to sign the Official Secrets Act and thereafter, I was told, no one could know of these meetings \u2013 not my family, not my girlfriend (now my wife), not my friends \u2013 and that would, potentially, be the defining fact of my life from now on. I sat there with a pen poised above the dotted line and had a sudden, unnerving sense of that future, the divisions of loyalty it would involve, the psychological doubleness it would require. I doubt very much I was ever spying material anyhow, but, in that moment, pen poised, I decided not to go ahead.\n\nI mention that story now only because I was reminded of how that moment felt while sitting one afternoon last month in snowy London with Andr\u00e1s Forg\u00e1ch. Through spy fiction and films, we have perhaps become blas\u00e9 about the family betrayals required by state secrecy. Forg\u00e1ch, a Hungarian, reminds me that in the east of our continent, where those compromises were a fact of life for many families for whole lifetimes, they are rarely so sanguine.\n\nA playwright, teacher, novelist and artist, Forg\u00e1ch is one of the last of those ferociously well-read Eastern European intellectuals who came of age as a dissident under Soviet communism and learned, after the revolutions of 1989, that the market economy imposed different kinds of limits on artistic liberty. He slips in and out of several languages, while speaking perfect, nuanced English. He has the wild hair and half smile of the pathologically curious. He is first excited to tell me he has a son \u2013 his first child \u2013 who is just over a year old. He is 65. Over the course of a couple of hours, he patiently tries to explain to me, in bursts of anecdote, the other ways in which his entire life has recently been upended.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Double life: Forgach\u2019s mother, Bruria, bathing in the Mediterranean in 1943 while in Lebanon\n\nFor the previous few days, I have been piecing together that story from his sometimes riddling memoir, No Live Files Remain, which is a voyage around the life of his parents, in particular the life of his beloved mother, Bruria, who died in 1985. It is a semi-mythologised tale, told in turns by Forg\u00e1ch as fiction, and poetry, and journalism, a story rooted in the compacted history of the Cold War. The book has been something of a literary sensation not only in Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s native Hungary, but also in some of the 14 countries in which it has been translated; the film option, with a nod to The Lives of Others and The Bridge of Spies, has been sold to Film4.\n\nThe genesis of the book was a call Forg\u00e1ch received in autumn 2013 from a researcher at the secret police archive in Budapest. In contrast to other ex-iron curtain countries \u2013 particularly the former East Germany \u2013 little effort or resource has been put into indexing that archive in Hungary. \u201cAnd,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch suggests, \u201call the dominant political forces are very happy about that. They destroyed a lot. They stole a lot. They used some for blackmail, but most of it is gone.\u201d It was only by chance that Forg\u00e1ch had been contacted. The researcher happened to be a childhood acquaintance, and when he saw Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s name in a file he felt duty-bound to contact him to discuss what he had found.\n\nThe call and the subsequent meeting in a caf\u00e9 changed everything. \u201cThere are things in life we can fathom only if they happen to us,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch writes. \u201cOne such event is our mother\u2019s death\u2026 Or, try this one for size, one very fine day \u2013 OK not such a very fine day \u2013 it turns out your mother was recruited by the intelligence services of the communist regime\u2026\u201d In some ways, the secret files opened up for Forg\u00e1ch the saddest story he had ever heard; it was also perhaps news he had been waiting all his life to know, to help make sense of things.\n\nI suggest to him that the lives of our parents, particularly before we are born, are always the first mystery available to us. Characteristically, he disputes that idea.\n\nThe truth is, he could hardly have known more about his parents\u2019 past lives, he says. His father had been, in his own extended family, one of only three survivors of the Holocaust. Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s formative years were therefore crowded with tragic stories of befores and afters, of the lives of all the aunts and uncles and cousins who were murdered by the Nazis.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ultimate betrayal: the author with his mother in their old apartment in Budapest, in 1975. In 1976, they travelled to Israel \u2013 her first job at the foreign agency branch of the communist secret service, then called III/I.\n\nOn his mother\u2019s side the past was, if anything, even more vivid. Bruria grew up in Tel Aviv, where her father was a legendary literary figure, a novelist and the translator of Joseph Conrad and Bertolt Brecht. His mother had rejected her homeland in adopting communism and moving to Hungary and becoming a fervent anti-Zionist. Even so, when her father visited the family, he was greeted as a kind of god. \u201cHe looked like Einstein,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch says, \u201cwhite hair, blue eyes, we all gathered around him.\u201d\n\nThose rival histories were further captured in two sets of letters Forg\u00e1ch had inherited. The first set were those exchanged between Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s mother and father, from when they first met, two young idealists. The letters revealed what Forg\u00e1ch always knew: \u201cIt was love from my father\u2019s side; it was not love from my mother\u2019s side.\u201d (His mother was instead infatuated with a British soldier, whom she met after the war, and never got over.)\n\nThe second set of letters was even more revealing. They were sent by his grandmother from Tel Aviv, every week for 30 years, to her daughter in exile. Forg\u00e1ch used these letters as the basis for a family memoir he wrote in 2007. It ran to 700 pages and took as its title the Hebrew phrase that punctuated all of his grandmother\u2019s writing, which translates as \u201cC\u2019est la vie\u201d. Once he had completed that book, Forg\u00e1ch thought he had exorcised all of his complex family history. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he says, \u201cI realised nothing of what I had written was true.\u201d\n\nWhat was never in doubt was that his parents were Stalinists, even after 1956, when Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest to crush the popular revolt. \u201cThe structure of the beliefs my parents had in their heads at the end of their life was the same as they had when they were 16 years old,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch says. He had no idea, however, that these loyalties were stronger even than those to their children.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018It was love from my father\u2019s side; it was not love from my mother\u2019s side\u2019: an early shot of the author\u2019s parents\n\nThe details of his mother\u2019s betrayal discovered in the files are often quite banal, an alternative family history told in footnotes, in which she despairs at her children\u2019s wayward political beliefs, provides names of their more free-thinking friends, and works to infiltrate and undermine the \u201cZionist conspiracy\u201d on trips abroad. Her confessions take on a more sinister note in the early 1980s when she is persuaded to provide her handlers access to her son Andr\u00e1s\u2019s own apartment, at which perhaps Hungary\u2019s most notable political dissident, the poet Gy\u00f6rgy Petri, was then staying.\n\nPetri, Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s friend and mentor, was the author of the first samizdat (underground) publications in Hungary and the co-editor of a banned newspaper critical of the Soviet-backed regime. The files suggest that Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s mother had been persuaded that the secret police were interested in spying on an apartment across the street; she concocted a cover story involving her offering to clean Andras\u2019s apartment while he was out. In this way, it seems, she gave the authorities their first access to Petri and his associates.\n\nIt was not that long after this betrayal that Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s mother died. In the final footnotes to the fictionalised part of this story, which quote verbatim from the files, he turns on her, in outrage at the financial bargain she had struck for a certain piece of information offered. \u201cMum, there is no need for this. For 2,000 forints? Just say the word, and I\u2019ll give you 2,000 forints. Here you are. Here. Take it!\u201d\n\nAt the root of this hurt is a half-acknowledged Oedipal rage, implied throughout the memoir. At one point, as we speak, Forg\u00e1ch pulls up some family photos on his phone \u2013 in one he is a baby smiling in his mother\u2019s arms; in the other he is 25 or 26, still staring at her adoringly.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew my mother always had secrets,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen she was mortally ill, my brother made a video of her, you know, \u2018Tell us about this or that in your past.\u2019 She said on film, \u2018I would like to tell you everything, but I am not able to do so.\u2019\u201d Forg\u00e1ch knew that she had love affairs \u2013 he thought it was about that.\n\nHe explains his mother\u2019s double life in different ways. Some of it, he suggests, was a cry for help in her marriage. His father was brilliant and needy, apparently bipolar, a journalist and, it seems, also an informant for the regime for a period in London. His own files are lost. He suffered three \u201cshocks\u201d or breakdowns, Forg\u00e1ch says. The first came in the 50s, the second 10 years later, after which he underwent electro-shock treatment, and the third, which destroyed him, in 1973. \u201cHe realised he could not go on. He was 53 years old,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch recalls.\n\nBruria insisted on looking after her husband at home, along with her four increasingly wayward children. \u201cMy mother was a fantastic person, very warm but quite chaotic. I think serving the secret service was a kind of counterpoint to the chaos of the rest of her life.\u201d It gave her a structure, Forg\u00e1ch suggests, perhaps even someone to talk to.\n\n\u201cShe was extremely beautiful, very cultured, and yet she was so narrow-minded about politics. That is the paradox of the personality. If she at 14 or 16 decided that Stalin was the greatest person in the world, and that Zionists were killers and Nazis, she could not give up on that lie.\u201d\n\nForg\u00e1ch himself swallowed some of it, too, indoctrinated until he was about 16. His mother suggested at one point to her minders, he discovered, that he might also be of use to them. But in 1968, when Soviet tanks went into Prague, he saw the hollowness of his parents\u2019 reality.\n\nHis initial response to that event was to move further to the left. Along with his brother and sister, also artists, he joined a Maoist group \u2013 much to his mother\u2019s dismay \u2013 again as revealed to her state minders. \u201cWe were part of a group led by a guy, a sculptor who showed all the classic signs of a revolutionary leadership,\u201d he recalls. \u201cVery hard line about political philosophy, and fucking all the 16-year-old girls who joined up. After about a year, I thought, enough.\u201d\n\nIt was then that Forg\u00e1ch met Petri, the poet on whom his mother eventually spied. A national hero to many Hungarians for his bravery in criticising the regime, Petri became a focal point of dissent. As well as offering him a place to stay, Forg\u00e1ch helped him print his samizdat newspaper, and distribute it, right up to 1989. Petri drank himself to an early death in 2000 but he was, says Forg\u00e1ch, a \u201cgreat writer and a deeply intelligent man\u201d.\n\nIf his mother had lived to have seen 1989, I wonder how he thinks she would have reacted to the fall of the regime.\n\n\u201cI think she would have become a strong feminist, a green probably,\u201d Forg\u00e1ch says. \u201dShe was going in that direction, but no doubt she would have kept this very archaic Soviet anti-Zionist rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWhat happened to the Hungarians who were exposed as informants after 1989? \u201cIf it was an actor or a writer or a politician, that was big news. If it was a normal citizen, it was not news.\u201d Quite soon, after the Berlin Wall came down, the popular line on the secret police files hardened into a simple binary. The wider public brusquely condemned the individuals \u2013 \u201cInformant!\u201d \u2013 or expressed boredom: \u201cEnough of the past.\u201d\n\nA version of those polarities has been reflected in Forg\u00e1ch\u2019s own family. His sister, Susan, still uses their mother\u2019s name as a pseudonym for her art. She is totally against her brother\u2019s decision to write about what has been discovered about her. \u201cShe says this is treason against our family, against my mother\u2019s memory,\u201d he says.\n\nForg\u00e1ch was torn originally by these arguments, but ultimately felt he had no choice but to tell the story.\n\nOne of the reasons, he says now, is the current rightwing, repressive Hungarian regime of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, which is reminiscent in some of its policy and tone to what went on under the Soviets.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a time when debate is being closed down again,\u201d he says, \u201cand truthful statements of whatever kind are absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nForg\u00e1ch has been vindicated by the fact that the book has reopened a debate about the role of the police state in Hungary, and found all the right enemies. One, a former minister in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government, suggested that Forg\u00e1ch \u201cwanted to clean his parents, but they are uncleanable\u201d. Another, a prominent supporter of the current regime, offered a line that has populist support. \u201cThe officers of the secret service were just doing their jobs,\u201d she has suggested. \u201cThe real traitors were citizens who aided them, people like the parents of Forg\u00e1ch.\u201d\n\nHe has also been charged with profiting from his family secrets; he recently walked into a caf\u00e9 in Budapest and an old political acquaintance shouted out: \u201cForg\u00e1ch! You have a lot to thank your mother for!\u201d\n\nHe smiles ruefully. \u201cThe fact is I do have a lot to thank my mother for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the love I had for her, and still have for her, that made me strong enough to write this book.\u201d\n\nBefore the end of our conversation, I ask Forg\u00e1ch, on the scale of sympathy and judgment, where he would now place his mother.\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t judge her,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are moments in this history that are shameful, and painful. I am crying for her. She gave my name to the officers, the names of my friends. But I think if you love somebody you see them as a full person. Otherwise, which of us would escape from judgment?\u201d\n\nNo Live Files Remain by Andr\u00e1s Forg\u00e1ch is published by Simon and Schuster at \u00a314.99.

McIntyre has been delivering exactly what people expect of him for well over a decade, and does so again tonight, with a show that deviates not one iota from the established formula. Fair enough: no one who likes what he does will be disappointed. But nor will they be surprised, as the king of primetime dispatches another 85 minutes of perky observations about family life, smartphones and bad traffic.\n\nIncreasingly it feels as if McIntyre\u2019s most remarkable achievement is to keep finding new things to notice in domestic custom and everyday human (or should that be British?) behaviour. When he riffs here on taking a bath, or de-icing the windscreen, you think: surely he\u2019s covered this before? But he retains the knack of making dull things effervesce. OK, the windscreen skit is more observations than jokes (he straw-polls the audience for favoured de-icing methods). But the hot-tub routine is a hit, drawing on McIntyre\u2019s physical comedy skills as he \u201chover-paddles\u201d above his scalding bath, testing the temperature with a delicate part of the male anatomy.\n\n\n\nAn interminable routine about traffic jams feels like being stuck in one\n\nAt such universally recognisable moments, you can see why \u2013 after long expressing no interest in breaking America \u2013 McIntyre recently took to the Broadway stage, en route to Asia, South Africa and beyond. Whether Hollywood beckons for this most parochial of English acts, who knows? At least the globetrotting supplies material tonight, as he jokes about swimming with sharks in Australia, burlesques the Belfast accent, and spins an unlikely story of malfunctioning electrics in a Norwegian hotel room.\n\n\n\nThe public realm rarely impinges; heaven forfend McIntyre express a divisive opinion. He mentions North Korea, only to cue a gag about his Asiatic looks. Elsewhere, with rare exceptions, he steers well clear of the culture wars\u2019 contested territory. Instead \u2013 in an interminable central section \u2013 McIntyre jokes about driving. He starts drolly enough, miming the pelvic thrusts once required to adjust the driver\u2019s seat position (\u201cOften you\u2019d overshag straight on to the steering wheel ...\u201d), but the gears are soon grinding. The gags about how we use hazard warning lights to communicate (do we?) feel effortful. And by the time, 20 minutes later, he\u2019s grumbling about letting other drivers in off slip roads, I felt like screaming for the next exit.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a routine about traffic jams that feels like being stuck in a traffic jam. But it\u2019s a general rule that McIntyre\u2019s cramped focus on banal subjects can induce a certain claustrophobia. Yes, he has the skills to illuminate banality with surprising perspectives, funny walks, brilliant flashes of wit. But it remains prose not poetry. You can leave your imagination at the door. And \u2013 tonight at least \u2013 it\u2019s all so shallow. There\u2019s no sense \u2013 as in the work of, say, sometime observationalist Rhod Gilbert \u2013 that any of this is true or deeply felt. It\u2019s all delivered in a tone of uniform tittering jollity, paring off what little distinction there is between the range of subjects under discussion.\n\n\n\nNone of which will matter to his many fans who will delight at another consignment of endearing observations and well calibrated self-mockery, delivered with real craftsmanship. But to the rest of us, it\u2019s comedy that skips across the surface like McIntyre himself across the stage: slick, slight and making no significant impression.\n\n\u2022 At Cardiff Arena, 11-16 April.

They will give their final concert in June, but this was their farewell to London. A near-capacity audience, including quite a number who may well have been at their first concert all those years ago, gave them a warm sendoff.\n\nThe programme stuck to the recipe that has proved so successful for the group for so long \u2013 an established, well-loved work alongside something heard less often, and something brand new. Since the ensemble was created by five musicians brought together to play Schubert\u2019s Trout Quintet, that was the obvious choice for the classic. Their performance of it had that comforting sense of utter familiarity and gentle wit, even though a bit more assertiveness might have been appropriate in the first and third movements.\n\nThe rarity was Chausson\u2019s Piano Quartet. It\u2019s a hefty chunk of French late Romanticism, which pays its debts to Brahms and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Franck, Faur\u00e9 and Debussy, all lit up by luminous harmony; but it requires exactly the firm structural grip brought to it here. The novelty came from Judith Weir, whose association with the Schubert Ensemble goes back to its earliest days. Her tribute, A Song of Departure, took Schubert\u2019s Abschied, the Rellstab setting from Schwanengesang, as the starting point for tiny meditations for each of the five members of the group in turn. It managed to be both authentically Schubertian and entirely Weirian at the same time.\n\n", "author": ["Andrew Clements"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/25/agnes-colander-review-ustinov-bath-trevor-nunn-harley-granville-barker", "published": "2018-03-25T11:53:13", "title": "Agnes Colander review \u2013 flawed portrait of a woman confronting her desires", "text": "\u2018Only little bits of me are developed, and those aren\u2019t the best,\u201d declares Agnes Colander (Naomi Frederick), who married young and has now deserted her husband. This \u201clost\u201d 1900 play by Harley Granville Barker, who went on to write The Voysey Inheritance and Waste and was a founder of the repertory movement, was written when he was young and it\u2019s not his best. Granville Barker himself declared it \u201cvery poor\u201d and suggested it should be destroyed.\n\nColin Chambers discovered the only known draft in the British Library, gave it to the American playwright Richard Nelson to revise, and the result can be seen in a handsome if sometimes stilted production by Trevor Nunn. It has its moments, but the interest is less in the dramatic \u2013 this is a play in which there is lots of talk and little action until the final scene \u2013 than as a social document of a woman who feels that she has \u201cfailed me\u201d.\n\n\n\nAgnes seeks to set that right, but it\u2019s not easy to chart a course of independence in an Edwardian world where respectable women do not discuss sex, live in sin, or try to make careers for themselves as painters. As the second-half encounter with Sally Scott\u2019s Emmeline Majoribanks makes clear, while an affluent widow may wear red lipstick and kiss other women\u2019s husbands, Agnes is more constrained both financially and socially.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A fitfully engaging curiosity \u2026 from left, Matthew Flynn, Naomi Frederick, Sally Scott and Cindy-Jane Armbruster. Photograph: Simon Annand\n\nSplit between Agnes\u2019s London studio and a seaside cottage in Normandy \u2013 both beautifully and economically conjured by designer Rob Jones \u2013 Granville Barker offers us a woman who, despite the desire to make her own life, is caught between three men. Should Agnes return to the elderly husband keen to have her back? Or should she begin a sexual relationship with her friend, the painter Otho (Matthew Flynn), or take seriously the attentions of the earnest young Alexander (Freddy Carter) who puts her on a pedestal? Alexander is very much in the mould of Eugene Marchbanks in Shaw\u2019s Candida.\n\n\n\nPerhaps we are supposed to see Agnes as a version of Ibsen\u2019s Nora after the door has been slammed and she has gone off to find a better version of herself. Perhaps Granville Barker is pointing to the difficulties that will be encountered, and the fact that for a woman of her class in the Edwardian era Agnes\u2019s choices are limited. In some ways he is braver than Ibsen because this is a play that confronts love and sex and the difference straight on. Matthew Flynn devours a chicken with such gusto that we are left in no doubt about his other appetites. But, whereas Nora\u2019s departure feels like a victory, Agnes\u2019s final choice may be more realistic but feels like a defeat.\n\n\n\nThere is sometimes quite a lot of acting going on here, the kind that offers signposts rather than subtlety, but Frederick is always the most interesting person on stage. She suggests that beneath Agnes\u2019s more conventional exterior lies a woman with an imaginative and emotional hinterland that she can\u2019t quite access. For all its flaws, this is an intriguing, fitfully engaging curiosity. Not least in the way it considers the ease with which men are able to work creatively and how for Agnes it might be that her true work of art is herself.\n\n\u2022 At the Ustinov, Bath, until 14 April.

Centring on a melancholy figure caught between his former home and his current lonely life, it\u2019s an arresting portrait of displaced struggles that moves almost inexorably from observational drama to eerie quasi-thriller. At its heart is a mesmerising (and often wordless) performance by Shahab Hosseini, who proved so magnetic in Asghar Farhadi\u2019s 2017 Oscar-winner The Salesman. Adept at conveying weighty emotional conflicts through minimal physical gestures (his kind but careworn face speaks a thousand words), Hosseini holds the audience\u2019s attention as Tabrizian\u2019s elliptical, diasporic drama unfolds mysteriously around him.\n\nThere\u2019s a distant echo of Robert De Niro in Hosseini\u2019s Gholam, a nocturnal minicab driver whose variously testing passengers fail to crack his taciturn shell. By day he works in a car repair shop and eats at his uncle\u2019s restaurant, where the spectre of estrangement and betrayal hangs heavy in the air. His young cousin Arash (Armin Karima) is a budding rapper who composes idealistic rhymes about being ready to \u201cdie for my people\u201d despite living far from any war zone. But Gholam, who has seen the horrors of conflict first-hand, plays his own cards close to his chest, even when recognised by a cafe customer as a \u201chero\u201d of the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nIncreasingly sinister attempts to involve him in an unspecified mission that would send him back to Tehran (where his mother still lives, pining for her son) fall upon deaf ears; Gholam has no desire to re-enter the battles of the past, and no illusions about contemporary political solutions. Yet the plight of a Trinidadian woman (Corinne Skinner-Carter), whose neighbourhood is being terrorised by young white thugs, spurs him to unexpected action, rekindling a lost spark.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Behrouz Behnejad and Shahab Hosseini in Gholam.\n\nTabrizian\u2019s eloquent and increasingly unsettling movie has its roots in her 2005-6 photographic series Border, a collection of portraits of \u201cexiles from Iran\u201d who have travelled to the UK, and who seem displaced from their immediate surroundings \u2013 a theme continued in this film. Indeed, one of the real-life exiles featured in Border served as the inspiration for the fictional Gholam, a man torn between old loyalties and present commitments, with no clear vision of the future. To his former comrades, Gholam is an enigma \u2013 someone who simply disappeared without trace. \u201cI know that guy,\u201d says a cafe patron. \u201cThought he was dead.\u201d And in a way he is, living a ghostly life, trapped between disparate worlds.\n\nCo-written by Tabrizian and Cyrus Massoudi, Gholam makes powerful use of sparse dialogue, low-key action and an atmospheric soundtrack which eschews incidental music in favour of loud silences and simple ambient noise. A recurrent visual motif finds cinematographer Dewald Aukema\u2019s static camera staring blankly through the windscreen of Gholam\u2019s car, the driver\u2019s face visible only in the letterboxed reflection of the rear-view mirror. While Jafar Panahi used a cab to foster playfully subversive conversation in 2015\u2019s Taxi Tehran, Tabrizian uses Gholam\u2019s car to emphasise his isolation \u2013 silently watching the world through glass.\n\nA strong supporting cast, which includes screen veteran Behrouz Behnejad, is augmented by cameos drawn from Tabrizian\u2019s Border project, blurring the line between drama and documentary. Having previously made short films, Tabrizian embraces the feature format with confidence, conviction and clarity of vision.

Most of them have travelled quite a way to get here, but there is cheer in their apricot flesh and the sweetness feels like luxury against the good-for-you frugality of the season\u2019s roots and cabbages. But their sweetness can cloy.\n\nThe marshmallow note of squashes, and particularly the butternut, needs taming with something savoury. Mushrooms, ginger, bacon (cooked crisp to contrast with the squishy flesh of the squash), salami, duck fat or soy will all do. As will parmesan and aged or salted ricotta. Miso too. Such flavours balance rather than bully, calming the butternut\u2019s one-note sugar hit.\n\nThe new season\u2019s vegetables are here already, broad beans from Italy and tiny artichokes the size of an egg, their dull green leaves flushed with violet (my butternuts came from Italy, too), and our own asparagus isn\u2019t far away now.

Cut the flesh into large chunks, then place in a single layer on a baking sheet or roasting tin. Peel the shallots, halve them, then tuck them among the squash.\n\nMix the olive oil and the paprikas then spoon over the squash, slide the dish into the oven and bake for about an hour or until the squash is patchily browned but thoroughly soft and tender.\n\nWarm the vegetable stock in a large saucepan. Add the squash to the stock, place over a moderate heat (use a few spoonfuls of the stock to deglaze the roasting tin if there are any interesting bits of roasted squash and shallot left), then season with salt and a little pepper and bring to the boil. Partially cover the pan with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes until the squash is falling to pieces. Crush a few pieces of the squash into the liquid with a fork to thicken it slightly.\n\nSlice the mushrooms thinly, then fry them in the olive oil in a shallow pan until golden. Peel the ginger and shred it into very fine matchsticks then add it to the mushrooms and continue cooking for a minute or two. When all is golden and sizzling, remove from the heat.\n\nLadle the soup into deep soup bowls then spoon over the soured cream and the mushroom and ginger.\n\nButternut and bacon tart\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Love me tender: butternut and bacon tart.

Alternatively, reduce to fine crumbs in a food processor. Add the egg yolks, the parmesan and the water, a tablespoon at a time, stopping when you have a firm, even textured dough. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.\n\nPeel the butternut, halve lengthways, discard the fibres and seeds then cut the flesh into short wedges. Place the pieces of squash in a steamer basket and cook over boiling water for 8-10 minutes until soft. Cut the bacon into pieces the size of a postage stamp then fry in the oil in a shallow pan until crisp. Remove from heat.\n\nMake the filling: beat the eggs, cream and milk, season then add the chopped parsley. Place the tart tin on a baking tray and line with the pastry, making certain you have pushed the dough deep into the corners and that there are no tears or cracks. Chill for 20 minutes in the fridge. Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and baking beans, then bake for 15-20 minutes, remove the beans and return the pastry case to the oven for 5-7 minutes or until the pastry is biscuit coloured and dry to the touch.\n\nLower the heat to 180C/gas mark 4. Place the pieces of butternut in the pastry shell then scatter over the crisped bacon. Pour in the custard and dust the surface with the grated parmesan. Bake for 25 minutes until the custard is just set.

However, we also see nuance in the data that provides a path forward for Republicans who run smart campaigns: namely, there is a significant opportunity for Republicans to attract more votes from Hispanic voters.\n\nBased on historical results, it is fair to assume Hispanics will mostly support Democrat candidates next November. In part, this is because many Republicans typically make very little effort in trying to attract Hispanic voters. However, it is also true that Republicans tend to perform better among Hispanics in midterm elections than in presidential elections.\n\nNonetheless, we know that, in order for our party to thrive in the future, we must improve our performance at the ballot box among Hispanic voters. That starts by having conversations with this growing population about issues they care about, while finding common ground between conservatives and the Hispanic voting population.\n\nPersonal choice, competition and freedom are all themes that resonate with Hispanic voters.\n\nIndeed, in a recent study our firms jointly fielded on behalf of a corporate interest, we found that nearly two-thirds of Hispanic voters (65 percent) indicated a willingness to cross party lines for candidates who reach out to them.\n\nThis bipartisan study, performed by WPA Intelligence, Deep Root Analytics and Civis Analytics, collected 3,000 interviews of Hispanic adults nationwide in December and January, and the results are encouraging for Republican candidates looking to mine hidden pockets of support in the upcoming election.\n\nIt is critical to be mindful that American Hispanics are not a monolithic voting bloc.\n\nAs with any other segment of the voting public, there are many nuances and distinctions that are driven by views on policies, age, educational attainment, occupation geography, country of origin, and family history in the U.S.\n\nIndeed, Republican candidates who understand this and aggressively focus developing a relationship with Hispanics across their constituent bases have realized significant gains by way of support at the ballot box. In Texas, a state the national press is desperate to say is \u201ctrending Blue,\u201d both Governor Abbott and Senator Cruz, each received more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in past elections.\n\nWhile many Democrats often appeal to Hispanics on the basis of \u201cidentity politics,\u201d we recommend Republicans engage in \u201cidea politics.\u201d\n\nFour key issues provide a path for Republican gains among Hispanic voters: tax cuts, repeal of the individual insurance mandate, an \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy and school choice.\n\nOur research found a majority of Hispanics shared the view that tax cuts would grow the economy instead of the alternative proposition that tax cuts would harm vital programs and only benefit the rich.\n\nAs more Hispanics ascend the ladder of economic opportunity, their personal experience more closely aligns with a Republican worldview that sees the risk posed by over-taxation and over-regulation. America is home to hundreds of thousands of Hispanic business owners, including many small business owners who see excessive government overreach as a greater problem than underfunded social welfare programs.\n\nNearly half of Hispanics surveyed also oppose the government mandating the purchase of products like health insurance. While surely valuing a safety net for the poorest of Americans, these voters know how expensive it is to pay skyrocketing insurance premiums under ObamaCare. Republicans can make inroads on this issue of personal freedom.\n\nSimilarly, a message emphasizing choice and competition works when it comes to energy production and education. Almost half of Hispanic voters \u2013 47 percent -- support an \u201call of the above energy policy\u201d that incents production from conventional generation sources, in addition to renewable sources. And despite 25 years of education unions demonizing school choice, 43 percent of Hispanic adults \u2013 three in seven \u2013 believe parents should have public and private school options to educate our children.\n\nPersonal choice, competition and freedom are the themes that resonate with Hispanic voters open to these Republican ideas. These voters do not think students in failing public schools should be sentenced to a life of lesser opportunity because of where they happen to live. While supporting a legitimate role for government, many also support a limited role for government, ensuring an economic climate conducive to job creation, and health and energy policies steeped in competition in order to control costs. They embraces the free market ethos of America. And they believe in the American Dream.\n\nBut Republican appeals to Hispanic voters are not made in a vacuum. The well-funded message machine on the left, assisted by the mainstream media, will surely change the debate from ideas to identity politics. They will cast the Trump immigration policies as divisive, and the only issue Hispanic voters care about. We encourage Republican candidates to not succumb to single-issue thinking.\n\nHispanic issues are American issues, and American issues are Hispanic issues. If Republican candidates want to survive the 2018 mid-terms, they need to not only develop a message centered on freedom and choice, but to use modern tools like data analytics to help them use their limited resources to deliver that message with precision to voters who are open to it.\n\nMany firms, in addition to ours, are doing innovative work with such digital tools, allowing campaigns to take their message directly to the right voters, in the right format, with personalized appeals on issues they care about passionately.\n\nIn many districts this election year, the key will be developing messages that appeal to Hispanic voters. Winning in a challenging election cycle requires mining for voters, even among traditional Democratic constituencies. The Republican campaigns that do this are more likely to be victorious.", "author": ["Chris Wilson"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/pnMfZ07pOaQ/reading-tea-leaves-on-bolton-and-other-trump-staff-changes.html", "published": "2018-03-25T14:54:00", "title": "Reading the tea leaves on Bolton and other Trump staff changes", "text": "All White House staff members know going in \u2013 or should know \u2013 that they serve at the pleasure of the president. This is true in the administration of every president, Democrat and Republican. If you\u2019re looking for job security, the White House is not the place for you.\n\nAs a result, some very fine people who served in the Trump administration \u2013 as well as a few who weren\u2019t up to the tasks they\u2019d been assigned \u2013 now find themselves on the outside looking in.\n\nIt\u2019s true that President Trump is impulsive. Folks who have known him from his days in New York say he\u2019s the kind of person who is most influenced by the last person he talked to. He\u2019s more interested in what works than he is grounded in any kind of philosophy of governing. Chaos is part of his management style.\n\nThis is hard for most of Washington to accept, let alone understand. The idea of people coming and going from senior positions with the frequency they\u2019ve gone in and out of the Trump administration is an alien concept to the long-term Washington professionals who make up what Trump and his allies derisively refer to as \u201cthe swamp.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump is nothing if not ambitious. His desire to be considered by history as one of the great presidents is enmeshed in his 2016 slogan: if he makes America great again it is because he himself is a great president.\n\nNonetheless, there\u2019s method in what appears to so many others to be madness. In the corporate world \u2013 the arena in which President Trump is used to operating \u2013 people who don\u2019t perform well or don\u2019t click with those above them on the organizational chart are generally encouraged to move on. We\u2019ve seen it with the president\u2019s original team inside the White House senior staff, in mid-level positions, and in the Cabinet \u2013 with more departures expected.\n\nThe question is not whether this swiftly revolving door bringing people into and out of the White House is discordant: it is. What\u2019s really at issue is whether it\u2019s produced the results President Trump wants. The answer to that question is a qualified yes.\n\nWhat President Trump is doing now \u2013 particularly in his appointment of Larry Kudlow to replace Gary Cohn as head of the National Economic Council and swapping Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster for John Bolton as his national security adviser \u2013 suggests his strategy now is to figure out how to get more new people to join his team.\n\nPresident Trump is nothing if not ambitious. His desire to be considered by history as one of the great presidents is enmeshed in his 2016 slogan: if he makes America great again it is because he himself is a great president. And, depending on how you assess presidential performance, he may be well on his way.\n\nAccording to The Heritage Foundation, the think tank that developed many ideas that became part of the Reagan Agenda, President Trump has already accomplished nearly two-thirds of what he set out to do. That\u2019s a remarkable achievement, probably unmatched by any president since Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nEven President Reagan, who left office with the three biggest items on his list crossed off as completed \u2013 win the Cold War, get the economy growing again, and revive the spirit of America in its institutions and its people \u2013 didn\u2019t get everything he wanted. Then, as now, spending continues to be a problem and the government, then as now, continues to grow.\n\nSome suggest these problems are insoluble. With Congress having just passed a spending bill that leaves the federal government almost unbelievably well-funded, they might be right. Or not, if the president can get the right people in place to take on issues related to the size and scope of government. So far, he\u2019s still looking for them.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with the changes President Trump has made thus far. Kudlow for Cohn and Bolton for McMaster are both trade-ups with strong roots in the Reagan Revolution.\n\nKudlow was part of the team that developed the policies the left derided as Reaganomics, but which created 20 million new jobs and an economic recovery that no president since has been able to achieve.\n\nBolton, even though he is more closely associated with George W. Bush than Reagan, is a believer in a muscular foreign policy that gives enemies no quarter they have not earned.\n\nIn these appointments President Trump may be looking to the past to replicate the kind of successes President Reagan enjoyed and then to build on them.\n\nWhat was true of his campaign is true of Trump\u2019s presidency: there\u2019s more to it, much more, than meets the eye.", "author": ["Peter Roff"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/CW4fAdtsMhQ/palestinian-civil-war-causes-suffering-in-gaza.html", "published": "2018-03-25T09:00:00", "title": "Palestinian civil war causes suffering in Gaza", "text": "The Palestinian civil war descended further towards disaster with the recent attempted assassination of Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah. The struggle between Fatah and Hamas is an important reason why the coastal territory\u2019s nearly 2 million residents live in a situation of permanent instability and uncertainty.\n\nThe assassination attempt, which also targeted Palestinian Authority Minister of Intelligence Majid Faraj, came nearly 11 years after Hamas violently wrested control of the Gaza Strip from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority (PA) in a deadly coup.\n\nHamas governance has brought further misery to the people the terrorist group rules. Its firm refusal to recognize Israel, rejection of Palestinian agreements with Israel, and engagement in terrorism invited the blockade of Gaza by both Israel and Egypt, the two countries with which it shares borders.\n\nWhile no person was killed in the bombing of Hamdallah\u2019s convoy, it likely marked the death knell of the latest Fatah-Hamas reconciliation agreement, announced in October, which was already as doomed as previous efforts. The Palestinian people continue to be the main losers, thanks to the fecklessness of their leaders.\n\nPA President Mahmoud Abbas, the putative moderate in the face-off, has also acted irresponsibly. He rejected an invitation to a White House meeting on Gaza\u2019s humanitarian challenges \u2013 a well-intentioned effort by the Trump administration to address the Gaza situation.\n\nThe White House meeting drew representatives of 20 countries, including some that do not regularly speak to each other, such as Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. What they have in common is their shared concerns about the regional ramifications of Gaza\u2019s chronic issues.\n\nGaza has received generous financial support from the U.S., the European Union, the United Nations and others. But some donor fatigue has set in after years of reckless mismanagement, waste and corruption by Hamas.\n\nUnfortunately, Hamas has made its top priority assembling rockets and missiles to be fired into Israel, digging sophisticated tunnels into the Jewish state and instigating three wars against Israel. Since the beginning of the year, Israel has discovered and destroyed several tunnels, presumably rebuilt after the 2014 conflagration.\n\nIsrael has sought, out of both humanitarian and security concerns, to ensure that Gaza does not descend into a total collapse. Daily trucks with food and other supplies enter Gaza from Israel, and Israel recently appealed to European Union countries to provide $1 billion in urgent assistance.\n\nGaza\u2019s desperation was confirmed in a recent World Bank report, which attributed some of the fault for the economic crisis in Gaza to the power struggle between Fatah and Hamas.\n\nHow to break the Palestinian leadership gridlock is a huge challenge. It will take creative global guidance and initiative by the United States.\n\n\u201cAn essential part of achieving a comprehensive peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, including those in the West Bank and Gaza, will be resolving the situation in Gaza,\u201d said Jason Greenblatt, President Trump\u2019s special envoy to the peace process. He spoke at the White House conference only hours after the attempt to kill Hamdallah.\n\nThe White House meeting should continue the conversations and press for delivery of aid, while avoiding direct contact with Hamas until the terrorist organization cedes authority to the PA \u2013 a key component of the reconciliation agreement that is currently on hold. And in turn, Abbas\u2019s PA would then presumably stop holding back on paying salaries of employees in Gaza and the fuel bills for electricity.\n\nImagine how much more the Palestinian people would be suffering at the hands of their own leaders if, hypothetically, Israel were not situated between the two Palestinian territories \u2013 Gaza and the West Bank \u2013 that are supposed to become a Palestinian state. The Palestinian civil war would likely already be much worse.\n\nEvery effort must be made not just by the U.S, but also by our European and Arab allies, to press Abbas to stop his globetrotting and speechmaking at the European Union Parliament and the U.N. Security Council so he can spend more time at his headquarters in Ramallah in the West Bank and return to direct peace talks with Israel.\n\nThe woefully misguided efforts of Abbas to subvert the traditional and essential American role in the peace process will not improve conditions for the Palestinian people he represents.\n\nBack in 1994, one of the first bilateral agreements Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed was known as \u201cGaza First.\u201d They recognized that establishing Gaza as a successful example of Palestinian self-government would be a step toward building up the institutions, economy and society needed for possible statehood.\n\nSadly, the record of missed opportunities and despair is as clear as the guilt of the Palestinian parties chiefly responsible for Gaza\u2019s colossal failure.\n\nStill, solving the Gaza situation remains one key to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace, as well as stability and security on Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt. This important and challenging task demands bold action.", "author": ["Kenneth Bandler"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/FHJRXnlqx7A/steve-hilton-1-3-trillion-omnibus-bill-shows-why-populist-revolution-has-to-target-congress-next.html", "published": "2018-03-24T21:30:00", "title": "Steve Hilton: The $1.3 trillion omnibus bill shows why the populist revolution has to target Congress next", "text": "We hear all the time these days that President Trump is \u201cundermining democratic norms.\u201d Well, how about this for a democratic norm? The policies people vote for in an election should be the ones that get implemented after the election.\n\nOh wait, that would mean we had an actual, functioning republic, wouldn\u2019t it? But we don\u2019t. We have a Swamp, and this week\u2019s public policy shambles in Washington \u2013 resulting in a fiscally incontinent and democratically illegitimate $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill \u2013 showed that the Swamp is not being drained but steadily refilled.\n\nLet\u2019s take the democratic illegitimacy first.\n\nYou may not agree with \u2013 in fact you may violently disagree with \u2013 President Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cBuild the Wall.\u201d But can there be any voter in America who was unaware of that promise by the time of the 2016 election? Of course not. So it is simply staggering to see the sheer scale of our elected representatives\u2019 arrogance in refusing to do what the American people voted for.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the spending bill fails to fund the construction of a border wall along the lines the president has proposed. Almost unbelievably, it literally prohibits building a concrete wall or other prototypes. Not so much \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d as \u201cBan the Wall.\u201d\n\nAnd look at what Congress did to President Trump\u2019s promise to increase border security by hiring additional border officers.\n\nThe president signed an executive order soon after he took office calling for 10,000 more U.S. Immigration and Customers Enforcement (ICE) officers to protect America\u2019s borders. He then scaled that back in his own budget submission to just an extra 2,000 officers. Guess how many are included in the budget Congress approved? The number of additional officers is capped at a mere 65.\n\nAgain \u2013 you may disagree with the idea of boosting the number of border agents. But surely every American would agree that if people vote for something, they should get it.\n\nThis budget\u2019s blatant overturning of central planks of 2016\u2019s winning Republican presidential platform is a calculated insult to American voters. It\u2019s the Swamp saying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who or what you vote for, we\u2019ll do exactly what we want anyway.\u201d\n\nThis is yet another example of the failure of our political system to deliver on promises that fueled the rise of anti-establishment candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the first place.\n\nDemocrats may think they scored a big political win by blocking so many of the president\u2019s signature promises. But all they are doing is stoking the populist anger and resentment that they claim to despise.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans claim to take seriously our nation\u2019s growing fiscal crisis. But instead of dealing with it, they\u2019ve added to it. There was no apparent effort made to rein in all sorts of wasteful spending\n\nFinally, and perhaps most depressingly for those on the right, there was the astonishing chutzpah of House Speaker Paul Ryan who, when asked by Ben Shapiro this week to set out the philosophical differences between conservatives and liberals, castigated the progressives\u2019 ideology as being one that ends with \u201celites in Washington micromanaging our lives.\u201d\n\nExcuse me? What exactly is this monstrosity of a spending bill, other than yet another example of ... elites in Washington micromanaging our lives?\n\nRyan, of course, knew only too well how appalled people would be by this giant spending bill and so tried to get his defense in early, claiming that the deadline meant it had to be passed despite its flaws. The budgeting process must be reformed for the future, he said.\n\nNo! It\u2019s not the budgeting process that needs to be reformed! It\u2019s the entire government. The truth is that year after year, decade after decade, more and more power has flowed from the hands of people, families, neighborhoods, towns, cities, counties, states ... all in one direction: up to the federal government in Washington.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s the executive branch and its sprawling, unaccountable departments and agencies (the real Deep State); the legislative branch with its feckless, corrupt representatives and policy staff in the pockets of donors and lobbyists; or the judicial branch with its rulings over many decades that have allowed the concentration of political and economic power. One way or another, the federal government in Washington has grown bloated and fat at the people\u2019s expense.\n\nNone of the current leadership in the two main parties will do anything about this: whatever they say, they love the power and control it brings them. This spending bill is proof of that.\n\nAnd all the congressional leaders are responsible for this outrage: House Speaker Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, both Republicans; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, both Democrats. We ought to call the legislation they approved the Ryosi-McSchumer spending bill.\n\nThere is only one long-term solution: the populist revolution with its demand for people power and decentralization must target Congress next. We need to elect Positive Populists who will go to Washington and give their power back to the people.\n\nWe\u2019ll be debating all this on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT on \u201cThe Next Revolution\u201d on the Fox News Channel.

This is not a fashion trend or the latest must-have item, but rather a safety requirement following the recent school shooting in Florida that claimed 17 lives. All this is heartbreaking and, as a parent, a challenge to navigate.\n\nWhat do we say when our kids ask why? What do we say to the littlest ones \u2013 who are excited to paint, learn to read and try their hands at addition and subtraction \u2013 but who are also scared of something they can\u2019t possibly understand?\n\nWhat do we say to the high school student who is eager to round out his or her college application by participating in afterschool activities, but is too scared to stay at school for any length of time beyond the required hours?\n\nMiddle schoolers face the most awkward years of their lives and now \u2013 in addition to trying to figure out who they are and how to navigate those uncomfortable years \u2013 they are also faced with the fear that saying or doing the wrong thing could land them on someone\u2019s literal hit list.\n\nIt is no wonder anxiety in children is at an all-time high. I would venture to guess the numbers will continue to rise.\n\nI have four kids and I lead an organization devoted to strengthening marriages and families, but when children are being shot in their schools, fear can easily take root, even for me.\n\nSo, what can parents do? I believe it starts in the earliest years. Even with our toddlers we can be committed to authenticity. We can allow our own emotions to show and we can model real life to our kids.\n\nAs they watch us navigate the toughest realities of life, our children will gain the confidence to do it too. We can acknowledge their feelings and help them understand and name what they are experiencing.\n\nAs followers of Jesus, my wife and I teach our kids about a loving God who cares about their pain and desires to know and offer full acceptance of them in Christ. We do this by walking out our own faith in their view. As they hear the earnest prayers of our hearts, they understand what it means to live and experience the ups and downs of life.\n\nIf we build a foundation of support and understanding at home when things are going well then, when the tough stuff comes \u2013 as it undoubtedly will \u2013 our children will recognize that not only are their parents in their corner, but the God of the universe is as well, and they will know how to lean on the faith they\u2019ve seen modeled.\n\nFear is an unavoidable part of the human experience, but so too are joy, compassion, frustration, anger, happiness, excitement, sadness and more. Fear is just one way to feel out of a whole host of feelings, but Christians can approach fear with a different sort of confidence.\n\nWhat I hope and pray for my kids is that they will have the ability to recognize what they are experiencing so we can work together to find a way through. Even though there are legitimate things to fear, we must not allow fear to control us.\n\nIf the fear of a potential attack takes away our willingness to live, then evil has already won. The horror is real. The devastation and shocking potential for human depravity are real. But we cannot allow these possibilities to steal our opportunity for a rich and joyful life.\n\nThe younger generation must learn, as each generation before has learned, to continue to live despite the potential for harm.\n\nBecause our faith is such an integral part of our life as a family, I often wonder how a parent possibly walks through the challenges of life without a strong faith tradition. If our only hope comes from the expectation of positive news headlines, we will surely grow faint and give in to the temptation to give up.\n\nI simply cannot imagine facing life with nothing but my own strength.\n\nAt FamilyLife, the organization I head that provides biblically based help for people at every stage of marriage and family life, we are committed to helping parents replace fear and uncertainty with hope, and equipping them to guide their children with confidence, even in the most tumultuous times.\n\nThere are no easy answers to the hard questions facing our society and our children today. But, when I am unsure of what to do, I start by studying Scripture and leaning into the wisdom of the generations.

I think you will find it as amazing as I did.\n\nDr. Kiron Skinner, a remarkable scholar, hosted me at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n\nAccording to the U.S. News & World Report\u2019s \u201cBest Colleges\u201d rankings, Carnegie Mellon has the nation\u2019s top graduate level artificial intelligence (AI) program and one of the top five undergraduate computer engineering programs. On Wednesday, the people at Carnegie Mellon showed me a few of the reasons they are held in such high regard.\n\nBefore I get into what I saw this week, let me better explain what I mean by seeing a glimpse of the future.\n\nEvery aspect of government procurement will have to be replaced (not just reformed \u2013 replaced) given the speed of new capabilities inherent in the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nYears ago, while serving as commanding general of the Training and Doctrine Command for the U.S. Army, Gen. Fred Franks told me he looked for \u201cglimmerings\u201d of the future. He said \u201cglimmerings\u201d were ideas, events or developments that were not yet clear but might evolve into something important.\n\nI was intrigued with glimmerings because of two earlier developments in my life.\n\nFirst, in 1965, as an undergraduate student at Emory University, I began working with Pete Jensen at what would later become the Rich Computer Center at Georgia Tech. Pete was one of the great pioneers of computing and in a few years introduced me to ideas (glimmerings), which evolved over the next half century into the Internet and modern computing. My own activities had been dramatically enriched by Pete\u2019s ideas and teaching.\n\nSecond, I had been privileged to work with Alvin and Heidi Toffler as their thinking evolved from their bestselling book, \u201cFuture Shock,\u201d to their even more important book, \u201cThe Third Wave.\u201d The observations and insights they developed for \u201cThe Third Wave\u201d are still valid over three decades later. They gave me an entirely different perspective on the scale of change our civilization was going through. The Tofflers and their work were very influential in the thinking that led to the Contract with America in 1994.\n\nWith this background, I have always been looking for the breakthroughs that will dramatically change our way of doing things. Starting in 2001, I began looking at nanoscale science and technology, quantum computing and the revolution these two systems would bring about \u2013 a revolution that is still only in its infancy.\n\nAround 2007, I began talking with oil and gas experts about the revolutionary breakthroughs in fracking, and their inevitable impact on our ability to produce oil and gas. In 2008 that led me, in collaboration with my former colleague Vince Haley and Sean Hannity, to launch \u201cDrill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.\u201d\n\nMy wife Callista and I also made a documentary, \u201cWe Have the Power.\u201d The left, led by President Obama, ridiculed the whole idea of using America\u2019s resources to become energy independent.\n\nInfluenced by the growth of fracking, in 2012 I wrote the book, \u201c$2.50 a Gallon.\u201d Again, President Obama singled it out and attacked me as a demagogue who was suggesting the impossible. Of course, he was totally wrong, and the fracking revolution has made America dramatically better off.\n\nOn Wednesday, in Pittsburgh, I saw another powerful glimmering of technologies that will change our world. The ability to develop intelligent systems that can learn and adjust is rapidly evolving. These systems will give us new capabilities and new insights in ways we have never imagined.\n\nIn a few brief hours at Carnegie Mellon, I saw a voice analysis system that could be combined with cellphone technology to enable remote medical analysis of virtually everyone on the planet. It would create an extraordinary new approach to early diagnostics and constant monitoring at an astonishingly low cost.\n\nI watched a robotic assistant reduce the invasiveness of heart surgery so that instead of patients taking 14 days to recover, they could leave the hospital after one day.\n\nAnd the potential for 3-D printing and robotics, combined with reusable rockets, will totally change how we think about space. This is just astonishing.\n\nEvery aspect of government procurement will have to be replaced (not just reformed \u2013 replaced) given the speed of new capabilities inherent in the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nWe will also have to rethink adult education.\n\nArtificial intelligence will displace many traditional service jobs, while also creating new jobs. The challenge will be helping adults make the transition from outdated skills to the new, higher-paying and more interesting skills made possible by artificial intelligence.\n\nOf course, during this development, we must constantly work to improve these systems to make sure they are safe. This constant development in itself will require advancements in both human and machine learning.\n\nWe must learn from and continuously work to prevent tragic accidents like the one this week in Tempe, Arizona where a woman was struck and killed by an autonomous car.\n\nIt is also clear that we have to invest heavily in artificial intelligence if we are going to maintain our competitive and national security advantages in the face of massive Chinese investment in the artificial intelligence field. We already know Chinese companies are working to build a huge fleet of self-driving vehicles. You can bet they will use and apply everything they learn in this endeavor in their military programs.\n\nAs I learn more over the next few months I will report on additional exciting new developments.\n\nThe future is going to be amazing, and we should be optimistic that as a free people we can lead the world into that future \u2013 just as we led the world with new developments in cars, airplanes, computers and the Internet.\n\nThere is much more to come.", "author": ["Newt Gingrich"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/zTzRWIyCKjU/march-for-our-lives-four-congressmen-say-every-child-has-right-to-school-free-from-violence.html", "published": "2018-03-24T17:20:00", "title": "March for Our Lives: Four congressmen say every child has the right to a school free from violence", "text": "The deadly school shooting that claimed 17 lives in Parkland, Florida, last month has highlighted the need for major reforms and improvements to the safety and security at our nation\u2019s schools. The massive March for Our Lives in Washington on Saturday and smaller demonstrations around the country demanded action to reduce gun deaths.\n\nEvery child has the right to walk into a classroom and feel safe and encouraged to learn, not scared of violence. This week in Great Mills, Maryland, we saw the benefits of having school safety measures and resources in place, when a school resource officer fatally shot a 17-year-old gunman who had shot two other students \u2013 including a 16-year-old girl who later tragically died of her wounds.\n\nWe have also seen the terrible consequences when precautions, protocols and coordination with law enforcement are not in place or are not followed and school shootings end with greater numbers of students dead and wounded.\n\nThat\u2019s why Republican Main Street members have taken the lead to prioritize legislation and funding in Congress to keep our schools safe. We started the Republican Main Street Caucus School Safety Working Group to identify ways Congress can help and continue to make this issue a national priority. We have been working closely with leadership in the House to ensure we can follow through on these promises.\n\nLast week the House began its effort to provide the necessary infrastructure and resources for students nationwide by overwhelmingly passing a bill led by one of us, Working Group member and former sheriff Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla. The STOP School Violence Act strengthens several vital layers of security and improves school safety by providing funding to give students, law enforcement, teachers, and school officials the tools and training they need to identify signs of violence or suicide and prevent events before they happen.\n\nThe STOP School Violence Act also provides schools with resources for technology and equipment to aid in the prevention of violent events. This includes anonymous reporting systems, the development of mobile security apps, and developing local hotlines to report warning signs. The funding can also be used for physical equipment to keep students safe, like metal detectors or locks.\n\nA key provision authored by another one of us, Working Group member and former first responder Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., helps more schools install panic buttons to directly signal law enforcement during a crisis. Nationwide, our banks, office buildings, and even most retail locations, have panic buttons \u2013 our schools should have the same ability to contact law enforcement when faced with an emergency. Lastly, the STOP School Violence Act also provides funding to support coordination between our schools and local law enforcement.\n\nThese efforts are needed NOW. That\u2019s why another one of us, Main Street Chair Rodney Davis, R-Ill., along with many members of Main Street, called on leadership to fund school safety grants immediately by including them in this year\u2019s must-pass funding bill.\n\nMain Street members were pleased to see our voice make a difference this week, when the must-pass 2018 funding bill not only included the STOP School Violence Act to authorize future school safety programs, but also designated funds for critical school safety grants so we can help schools improve their security systems and protocols immediately.\n\nThe legislation passed this week also includes critical funding for other important programs within the Department of Justice, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services that address mental health, student safety and well-being, and fund critical law enforcement programs. Members of Main Street, under the leadership of another one of us \u2013 Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., head of the School Safety Working Group \u2013 will continue to find ways we can stop violence in our schools.\n\nOne bill we have already identified is sponsored by Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., called the School Training, Equipment, and Protection (STEP) Act. Before coming to Congress, Rep. Knight was a Los Angeles Police Department officer for 18 years.\n\nThe STEP Act was crafted following extensive discussions with law enforcement professionals about improving school safety. This bill would designate $50 million of an existing Department of Education grant program to be used for more physical security measures, like barricade technology, to enable faculty to quickly strengthen doors and windows in the event of an active threat situation.\n\nThe safety of our students, teachers and school personnel should be paramount. While there are many facets to this problem and more solutions needed to put an end to this devastating violence, equipping our schools with adequate safety measures is a critical first step. We will continue to work with our partners in Congress, as well as with school officials and law enforcement, to ensure the next generation of students can learn in schools free from violence.\n\nRepublican U.S. Reps.

There is an understandable emotional desire to \u201cdo something\u201d in response \u2013 but without evaluating what the \u201csomething\u201d will actually accomplish. This is the driving force behind the March for Our Lives taking place Saturday in Washington.\n\nThe motivations of many people taking part in the Washington event and other demonstrations around the country are sincere. But before we \u201cdo something,\u201d we need to stop and think: what is the most sensible thing we should do? What will actually save lives and make us safer?\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that the debate isn\u2019t between those who want to end violence and those who support gun rights. Both sides want to end violence. The debate is simply over how best to keep Americans safe.\n\nSupporting gun control is now the \u201cin thing.\u201d Stars such as Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus tweet their support. Time and Teen Vogue magazines run cover stories glorifying people working to put stricter controls on guns and ban some weapons. The New England Patriots used their team plane to fly students and families from Parkland, Florida, to Washington for Saturday\u2019s gun control rally.\n\nYou would be unlikely to know it from the media coverage of the Washington demonstration, but only 47 percent of Americans between 13 and 17 believe that more gun control could reduce mass public shootings.\n\nBritain\u2019s Guardian newspaper asked students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for their ideas on how to end violence. The ideas sound good at first glance and are certainly well-meaning. But in reality, the policies being proposed will either have no effect or even cause harm.\n\nHere are four of those ideas, and a look at their actual impact:\n\n1. Ban semi-automatic weapons that fire high-velocity rounds.\n\nGun control advocates say semi-automatic rifles are designed to kill people, not for hunting, target practice or self-protection. They say only members of our military need these guns.\n\nBut looks can be deceiving. An AR-15 rifle shoots the same bullets as a small game-hunting rifle. Both guns fire one bullet at a time, and with the same velocity. The guns merely look different on the outside. AR-15s may resemble military weapons but they aren\u2019t the same weapons used by soldiers.\n\nSemi-automatic rifles don\u2019t just take lives, they also deter criminal attacks and save lives. In 95 percent of defensive gun uses, no shots are fired. But if you do have to open fire, having a semi-automatic weapon means that you won\u2019t have to take the time to manually reload the gun. This additional time for the victim may make the difference between life and death.\n\nBanning all semi-automatic guns would endanger lives. So gun control advocates find it easier just to call for bans on the more scary-looking guns.\n\n2. Require national registration of guns.\n\nGun control advocates have long claimed that gun registration will help solve crimes. Their reasoning is straightforward: A registered gun left at a crime scene can be used to identify the criminal.\n\nUnfortunately, it rarely works out this way. Criminals almost never leave behind guns that are registered to them. In the few cases where guns are left at the scene, it is because the criminals were killed or injured. And these guns are virtually never registered to the person who committed the crime. Many are stolen.\n\nDuring a 2013 deposition, the Washington, D.C., police chief said that she could not \u201crecall any specific instance where registration records were used to determine who committed a crime.\u201d\n\nWhen I testified before the Hawaii State Senate in 2000, the Honolulu chief of police also stated that he couldn\u2019t find any crimes that had been solved due to registration and licensing.\n\nThe chief also said that his officers spent about 50,000 hours each year on registering and licensing guns. This time is being taken away from traditional, time-tested law enforcement activities.\n\nCanada and other parts of the U.S. haven't had any better luck. TV shows depict gun registration as an effective crime-fighting tool, but this isn\u2019t how things work in real life.\n\n3. Institute universal background checks and close gun show and secondhand sales loopholes.\n\nThese are actually different words for the same thing. Background checks on private transfers of guns is the first policy gun control advocates call for after each mass public shooting. But such background checks would not have prevented a single mass public shooting in this century.\n\nIn addition, over the years from 2000 to 2015, states that had universal background checks had twice the rate of mass public shootings as those that didn\u2019t have that law.\n\n4. Raise the firearm purchase age to 21.\n\nLet's not forget about the law-abiding young citizens who arm themselves for self-defense. What about the 20-year-old woman who is being stalked by a potential rapist or killer? Research shows that having a gun is by far the most effective way for young women to defend themselves.\n\nOf the 64 U.S. mass public shootings since 1998, 10 attacks were carried out by people under age 21 \u2013 five by people who were already too young to legally purchase their guns and five where increasing the age limit could make a difference. Even in the five cases where raising the age limit might have conceivably had an impact, it is likely that the shooters could have illegally obtained a weapon, just as many other attackers do.\n\nPrior to 1994, while some states had an age limit, there was no federal age requirement for buying a rifle. The only peer-reviewed study on this change was conducted by Thomas Marvell in the Journal of Law and Economics.\n\nMarvell concluded: \u201cWhere the 1994 laws seem to have an impact, the suggestion is almost always that crime increases; thus, there is no evidence that these bans had their intended effect.\u201d In fact, Marvell found that the law was associated with a 6 percent increase in firearm homicides.\n\nHere\u2019s a better idea\n\nSo if the above ideas all have big problems, what can be done to more effectively protect children in school?\n\nHaving more armed law enforcement officers and security guards in schools would be useful \u2013 but only if governments came up with additional money so that no other school programs are cut.\n\nLetting well-trained teachers and other school staff members carry concealed handguns if they wish is a much less expensive alternative. There are currently 18 states that have at least some schools where staff and teachers carry.\n\nThere have been no problems or increases in insurance premiums at the schools with armed staff members. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen in Utah, (school insurance) rates have not gone up because of guns being allowed,\u201d says Curt Oda, former president of the Utah Association of Independent Insurance Agents. Nor has a survey of other states shown any increase in insurance costs.\n\nArmed school staff would be a final line of defense against school shooters. Importantly, they would also be a deterrent. They wouldn\u2019t stop every school shooting, but they would most certainly save lives.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line: We all want to save lives, but being well-meaning isn\u2019t enough. The media\u2019s one-sided coverage of the gun control debate gives the false impression that only one side cares about saving lives and that virtually everyone agrees that the solution to gun violence is the strictest gun controls possible.\n\nSome have even called for banning all guns and eliminating people\u2019s ability to defend their families and themselves.

Earth Hour protestors nonetheless believe the world will be a better place if governments drive fossil fuels out of the marketplace \u2013 or simply force energy companies to keep coal, natural gas and oil \u201cin the ground.\u201d\n\nSuch thinking is wrongheaded for many reasons.\n\nAbundant, affordable, and reliable energy is a blessing, not a curse. Commercial energy, the vast majority of which still comes from fossil fuels, literally gives superhuman power to ordinary people.\n\nWealth and technologies supported by fossil fuels are what enable billions of people to live longer and healthier lives, in cleaner environments, and with greater access to information than even the most powerful elites of previous generations.\n\nThese blessings are still by no means universal. More than 1 billion people in developing countries still have no access to electricity and billions more have too little to eradicate poverty. We know very well by now that cheap, abundant energy is a key to bringing those people into our healthier and more comfortable world.\n\nRecent decades have seen substantial gains in global indicators of well-being: life expectancy, per capita income, child mortality rates, hunger rates, poverty rates, malaria incidence, literacy, and access to safe drinking water. All owe a great deal to fossil energy.\n\nNor is it true that fossil-fueled civilization is making the climate less \u201clivable.\u201d Since the 1920s, the vast majority of industrial-era carbon dioxide emissions entered the atmosphere and the world warmed by 0.08 degrees centigrade. At the same time, global deaths and death rates related to extreme weather declined by 93 percent and 98 percent, respectively.\n\nScary-sounding climate change forecasts come from models that predict two-to-three times as much global warming as has actually occurred since the late 1970s. Climate scientist Patrick Michaels reports, on the other hand, that there is only one model that accurately tracks the real warming trends.\n\nWhen this model is run with a realistic emission scenario (where natural gas continues to replace coal), the predicted 21st century warming is about 1.5 degrees centigrade. That means the world is already on track to meet the Paris climate treaty\u2019s maximum goal, but without new taxes and regulations, and without turning off anyone\u2019s lights.\n\nThe climate policies popular with the Earth Hour crowd are either a costly exercise in futility or a cure worse than the disease.\n\nPick any climate policy on the books today, and you will find an abysmal benefit-cost ratio. For example, the Obama administration\u2019s so-called Clean Power Plan, if implemented, could cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet it would avert less than 0.02 degrees centigrade of global warming 80 years from now, according to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s own climate model.\n\nMore importantly, developing countries already account for more than 60 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving the United Nations-sponsored Paris climate treaty\u2019s mid-century goal of cutting global emissions by 50 percent or more would require developing countries to make substantial reductions in their consumption of fossil fuels, leading to slower growth and fewer opportunities for struggling people.\n\nBesides, since when has collective darkness been the image of a virtuous society?\n\nLook at a nighttime satellite photo of the Korean Peninsula. South Korea, now one of the world\u2019s strongest economies, is lit up like a Christmas tree. Communist North Korea is plunged in darkness.\n\nIn North Korea, every hour is Earth Hour. Not because the people strive for \u201csustainability,\u201d but because the regime is a benighted tyranny.\n\nEarth Hour originated in 2007. The Competitive Enterprise Institute held its first Human Achievement Hour in 2009. Rather than ascribe mankind\u2019s progress to energy folly, we prefer to pay tribute to the wonders of human inventiveness, enterprise, and collaboration that provide our well-being and enable us to overcome our challenges.\n\nSo, come one and come all!

And the only way to facilitate small failures is to create the sort of environment where employees feel free to take creative risks.\n\nMarch 25, 2018 6 min read\n\nA Note From The Editor Think your company has what it takes to make our Top Company Cultures list? Apply now. Apply now \u00bb\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWhen PricewaterhouseCoopers recently asked CEOs what their companies most lacked, a surprising 77 percent cited something they probably have in spades: creativity.\n\nWhy can't company leaders seem to tap their teams' creativity? Accustomed to working with clear-cut Gantt charts and team hierarchies, executives often struggle to embrace employees\u2019 original ideas. By definition, such ideas haven't been tried before, so leaders worry they won\u2019t succeed. But by clinging to concepts that have worked in the past, leaders teach workers that their fresh ideas aren\u2019t wanted.\n\nPerhaps the issue lies partially in the corporate conception of creativity. Most companies separate their \"creative\" workers from their \"non-creative\" counterparts, which effectively walls off company decision makers from those who craft its product. Yet 72 percent of workers across all domains say that creativity is key to their professional success, according to a 2017 Steelcase study.\n\nSeparating decision makers and creatives might work when business is good, but it inevitably costs companies when the landscape shifts. When incumbents such as Blockbuster are faced with new technologies and business models such as streaming video, they struggle to recreate themselves quickly enough survive.\n\n\n\nRelated: To Disrupt or Be Disrupted: What's Your Choice?\n\nWhether leaders like it or not, the only way to combat catastrophic failures is with smaller, more manageable ones. And the only way to facilitate small failures is to create the sort of environment where employees feel free to take creative risks.\n\nWhy do some work environments promote creative freedom while others squash it? The key difference is psychological safety, a sense of security that employees must feel in order to offer up risky ideas.\n\nPsychological safety can't be dictated, though. It must come from cultural processes, protocols, and tactics that allow ingenuity to thrive:\n\n1. Emphasize collaboration over delegation.\n\nTeamwork promotes imagination because it tells individuals who are trying to solve tough problems that the whole team has their back. Companies that adhere to Balanced Team principles instill a sense of camaraderie in their teams because they bring together employees from across disciplines to solve problems faster and better than they could alone.\n\nWhat does a balanced team look like? On our teams, an engineer, a designer and a strategist sit together, solve problems together and fail together. They cross-pollinate to develop unique, functional designs that no one member could create on his or her own. While members own their specific functions, they share responsibility for the broader project.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Business Leaders Unintentionally Kill Collaboration and Creativity\n\n2. Define principles before beginning work.\n\nBecause our primary line of work is the creation of new products, creative ideation is part of every project we take on. But that doesn't mean we just throw ideas at a wall until our clients spot something they like. Instead, we begin by defining what the project, product or organization stands for. While the product's features or look might change, the values that underpin it should stay the same.\n\nFor example, we recently worked with a Mexican company that wanted to cut the churn rate of its salespeople, who felt demotivated, lonely and unsupported by company leaders. While we didn't have an answer in mind from the start, we did have a series of principles. We wanted our solution to take risks, give salespeople actionable steps for success and show them a vision for the future. We sought to build something that salespeople would love on first sight and want to continue using well into the future.\n\nDetermining your own project or company principles is a matter of asking questions upfront: What's the most impactful customer problem you could solve? What audience could your solution help? What does that audience care about? Those answers are the bedrock principles your product should stick to.\n\nRelated: How Establishing Core Values Drives Success\n\n3. Structure ideation with converge-diverge cycles.\n\nPerformance anxiety and fear of judgment are creativity killers. Patterning problem-solving sessions with convergent and divergent phases reduces individual worry and enables people to hone their ideas before confidently and succinctly presenting them to others.\n\nEd Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, highlights the importance of divergence with what he calls \"ugly baby\" syndrome. Just as real babies need time to mature, young ideas must be grown into concepts worth considering. According to Catmull, the pressure to \"feed the beast\" often causes companies to run with immature ideas.\n\nTeam members put their previously \"ugly babies\" on the table during the converge stage. Done well, they anonymous and unbiasedly determine which ones align best with the formerly described project principles. Apps such as Dotvoter, which we built for this very purpose, help teams decide which ones to move forward with by gathering everyone's feedback.\n\n4. Experiment relentlessly.\n\nNo matter how beautiful your team's baby is, it's unlikely to be the right one. Get team members comfortable with a constant flow of iterative, experiment-driven ideas by giving them the freedom to fail. Only with that freedom can employees relax and take risks, and only with regular risk-taking can breakthroughs occur.\n\nWhat if your team isn't yet comfortable with failure? Celebrate it when it happens. Ritualize learning from mistakes, missteps and misunderstandings. At the end of each week, write down what your team learned in the past seven days. Then, share your revelations. Doing so creates healthy distance between failure and judgment, reinforcing the idea that trying new things is more important than being correct.\n\nCreativity isn't as elusive as it appears to most executives. It bubbles beneath the surface of every team, bottled up by the fear that new ideas might fail. Releasing it is a matter of realizing that everyone can contribute to the team and that everyone's contributions are valuable even when they don't pan out. Ideas that fail are simply the seeds of those that succeed.", "author": ["Aliya Marder"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/baM2fPKb_tc/310762", "published": "2018-03-25T15:00:00", "title": "This Marketing Strategy Is a Game Changer for Resource-Strapped Startups", "text": "/\n\nTech-powered ABM is the future of marketing. Is your startup prepared for the transition?\n\nMarch 25, 2018 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nTake a look around any city sidewalk, classroom, restaurant or waiting room, and you\u2019ll see how prevalent technology has become in our society. In fact, according to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center, just more than a quarter of consumers say they're \"constantly online.\" But technology could never eclipse real human conversations and interactions, could it?\n\nAccording to Daryl Plummer, managing VP at Gartner, that reality is just a few years away. Plummer believes that by 2020, artificial intelligence tech (such as chatbots) will dominate both our social and business cultures, heading up everything from customer service interactions to lead discovery conversations. And because bots will be trained to deliver targeted messages, have personality and incorporate hyperlocal nuances into conversations, people could find great joy in engaging with them. Before we know it, we could all be conversing more with bots than with our own spouses.\n\nWe can thank today\u2019s information-fatigued consumers for innovative solutions such as this -- and, in part, for the growing popularity of account-based marketing. Rather than wasting time on mass marketing that fails to grab or keep targets' attention, ABM calls for marketers to tailor messages to specific personas or audiences -- ultimately personalizing the brand experience for users and generating more viable leads for the company.\n\nAnd when paired with certain technology, ABM can be a real game changer for businesses, especially resource-strapped startups and time-starved entrepreneurs looking to tip the scales in their favor.\n\nRelated: Don't Let the Hype Around Account Based Marketing Confuse You\n\nMaking ABM work for your startup.\n\nIt's the scaled-back, prospect-focused approach of ABM that's key to effectively engaging your targets and maximizing your team\u2019s efficiency. Each success you have with a targeted account will offer you new insights, skills and tools that will help you expand your marketing efforts as your startup grows.\n\nHowever, the true secret to ABM success is leveraging the right technologies to set your business apart from the others. The best emerging technologies will help you not only target and streamline your efforts, but also track and strengthen your engagement rates, saving you valuable time and money in the long run.\n\nSome technologies are already known to pair well with ABM. For instance, digital footprints can aid in identifying your audience\u2019s unique obstacles, and predictive intelligence solutions can help you anticipate target accounts' needs so you can perfectly time marketing messages. Furthermore, addressability and programmatic buying can enable you to target messaging to those with certain characteristics, such as job title.\n\nBut it's important to investigate less-common technologies and automation systems, too, until you\u2019ve customized a tech package that fits your company\u2019s unique audience, focus, needs and budget.\n\nRelated: 18 Marketing Trends to Watch in 2018\n\nWith your tech choices squared away, your next step is to incorporate them into your business plan. Here are some tips for making the conversion to ABM:\n\n1. Don't be a one-trick pony.\n\nSince 2013, Amazon has been the king of curating product recommendations. You can thank its ultrapersonalized home pages, in part, for teaching targets to ignore email blasts and banner ads that don\u2019t speak directly to them. That\u2019s why ABM emphasizes seizing their attention through personalized messages and customized brand experiences.\n\nThere are really no limits to how creative you can get personalizing your brand message or user experience. But you\u2019ll typically find that the more effort you put into customizing your outreach, the more engagement you\u2019ll get in return -- a top benefit of ABM, according to 83 percent of marketers surveyed by Demandbase.\n\nYou might start out by building personalized landing pages on your company\u2019s website for specific clients and target audiences. Customize these pages with images, text and special offers that fit the audience\u2019s unique preferences, interests and needs. Then, monitor whether these pages draw users back to your site and which features they interact with the most, and adjust your efforts accordingly.\n\n2. Take a course in social intelligence.\n\nWhat really sets ABM -- and potentially your brand -- apart is how you can make each account feel seen, heard, understood and appreciated. Doing so is vital to keeping your contacts satisfied. In fact, 84 percent of marketers told ITSMA that ABM has the highest return on investment of any marketing strategy or program, showing that ABM\u2019s customer-driven approach is key for marketers in retaining and growing business relationships.\n\nHow do you learn all the nitty-gritty details about your contacts so you can craft messages that make a real impact? And how do you keep up with all the changes and challenges they experience over time? A great place to start is by subscribing to a public information service, such as Google Alerts, that allows you to customize search parameters, track company activity and receive alerts whenever changes occur.\n\nTo unveil more minute distinctions, interests and challenges, monitor your target account's online social activity on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter (try the list-building feature). Each new tidbit of information will help you anticipate your contacts' evolving needs, reshape your marketing messages and boost your startup\u2019s value in their eyes.\n\n3. Look beyond sales.\n\nWe all know that networking can be helpful in business. But when you\u2019re working on a smaller scale, recognizing and capitalizing on business connections are frequently a pivotal part of building enduring relationships. It\u2019s often that \u201cwe run with the same crowd, so let\u2019s be friends\u201d connection that pushes target accounts to choose your startup over your competitors.\n\nRelated: How to Reconfigure Your Sales Operations for Account-Based Selling\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that networking for your startup isn\u2019t all up to sales, though. The rest of your team can make valuable connections that propel your business forward, too. In fact, a SiriusDecisions study found that when its clients cross-aligned their product, marketing and sales teams, they saw a 25 percent increase in revenue growth and a 56 percent increase in profitability.\n\nThe ideal way to uncover every valuable business connection your team may have is through the TeamLink feature on the LinkedIn Sales Navigator. With that information, you can then work your connections, get a dialogue going with potential customers and start building rapport that will hopefully lead to a sale.\n\nTechnology isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s infiltrating our social and business lives more and more every day. But that doesn\u2019t mean you need to adopt every form of new technology just to get your brand noticed.

Though several factors contributed to my successful turnaround, one in particular has led to more confidence, inspiration and awareness than any other: adventure travel.\n\nI've met plenty of frequent business travelers who want nothing more than to stay home once they get there. They certainly don't want to leave their creature comforts for something as seemingly trivial and meaningless as scaling mountains, walking quietly in nature or surfing Australia for several days. I get it. But I promise that adventure travel can do wonders for our business lives. That's especially true if we consider travel an educational experience more than anything else.\n\nRelated: Traveling the World Is an Adventure That Makes You a Better Entrepreneur\n\nSolely for the fun or challenge of it, I\u2019ve visited nearly half of America\u2019s national parks, stepped on five of the seven continents, explored dozens of foreign countries and met hundreds of people who are smarter than me. Doing so taught me several lessons that I've put to good use after safely returning home.\n\n1. Much-needed inspiration.\n\nWhen we visit new or otherwise foreign environments and cultures, we increase our chances of seeing the world from a different point of view. We're better able to examine our own problems and challenges from new perspectives. While this sometimes can happen on foreign business trips, it\u2019s not as frequent. Work-related travel usually fails to trigger subconscious problem-solving.

I was terrified recently, as I prepared for a 300-foot bungee jump over a Costa Rican rainforest. The thrill of overcoming that and similar experiences has made be better able to withstand the seemingly frivolous wrinkles that business throws our way.\n\n3. Reading people.\n\nI\u2019m convinced that clear communication can minimize more than half of all headaches in business (and possibly in life). Adventure and foreign travel often expose us to different languages, dialects and communication styles, giving us a broader understanding of how humans successfully interact with one another. It also leads to greater cultural awareness for smarter global marketing. Either way, if we want to learn new ways of reaching and influencing people, we must expose ourselves to the new and unfamiliar communication situations that adventure travel affords.\n\n4. Lead instead of manage.\n\nNo doubt about it: Everyday business management keeps the lights on. But if we really want to grow business, we have to lead with newer and bigger ideas. These usually are harder to see from within the trenches than they are from afar. When we travel, we force dependent work associates back home to carry on without us, our micromanagement, and/or our direct input. This not only makes them more independent workers, it also ultimately frees us to focus more on strategic growth. We don't spend all our time simply maintaining the status quo. As crazy as it sounds, our absence from the workplace helps others, too.\n\nRelated: Confidence Is the Willingness to Try\n\n5. Exceptional confidence.\n\nWe garner the respect of peers when we do unexpected or exceptional things. I\u2019m amazed by the number of times I\u2019ve made a favorable impression or even closed deals after sharing a recent adventure or experience that had nothing to do with work.

After ticking past the $1 billion mark in 2016, the machine learning market is expected to hit $39.98 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Research and Markets.\n\nWhere will all that growth come from? Everywhere! Machine learning was born in 1959, coined by computer scientist Arthur Samuel -- but only recently has the larger business community come to understand its value. In the next few years, it will be adopted by everyone from Fortune 500 firms to mom-and-pop shops.\n\nOf course, the first challenge of machine learning is identifying a use case. Not sure where to start? To make the most of this explosive technology, consider how today's top companies, ranging in industry from retail to hardware to media, are using it:\n\n1. Target: Learn from the present to invest in the future.\n\nRetail giant Target discovered that machine learning can be used to predict not only purchase behavior, but also pregnancy. In fact, Target's model is so precise that it can reliably guess which trimester a pregnant woman is in based on what she's bought. After a father discovered through Target's persistent promotions that his 16-year-old daughter was pregnant, Target actually had to dial its initiative back by mixing in less specific ads.\n\nMost companies' promotions are driven by the seasons or holidays. Snow shovels go on sale in July, sunscreen in June. But consumers go through seasons in their own lives, too. The worst time to sell someone a car, for example, is right after she just bought one. It might be the best time, however, to market car insurance to that person. Machine learning can pick up on those rhythms, helping companies recommend their products to customers when the timing is just right.\n\nMy company has used machine learning to spur loyalty purchases. We discovered that if a customer is going through a life event (such as graduation or marriage), he is more likely to change his behavior than at other times in his life. An education company that knows 20 percent of its users leave every May, for example, might use machine learning to refer likely grads to a corporate partner or sponsor.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons Machine Learning Is the Future of Marketing\n\n2. Twitter: Create the perfect preview.\n\nWhen someone posts a photo to Twitter, she wants people to see it. But if the thumbnail is 90 percent floor or wall, nobody is going to click on it. Twitter seems to have solved this problem by using neural networks. In a scalable, cost-effective way, the social media firm is using machine learning to crop users' photos into compelling, low-resolution preview images. The result is fewer thumbnails of doorknobs and more of the funny signs just above them.\n\nGive Twitter's thumbnail optimization a try for your next marketing campaign. Upload brand-aligned, user-generated photos, and let Twitter determine which elements of each image maximize engagement. Then, use the top-performing photo crops for your next Twitter campaign. Who doesn't love free market research?\n\nWe use machine learning to tweak images for conversational engagements. The challenge is making sure that rich images load quickly enough to keep up with a live conversation. A user who sends a question or search request expects a reply in the form of an image or GIF immediately. Using machine learning, we can deliver appropriate responses at scale in seconds.\n\n3. Apple: Embrace ensemble experiences.\n\nAnyone with more than one Apple product knows how well the devices play with one another. Now, the tech giant is using machine learning to create even more seamless customer experiences. Apple recently filed a patent that, in non-technical terms, implies that it's prioritizing cross-device personalization. In the near future, for example, a user's Apple Watch might suggest an iTunes playlist to match his heartbeat goal in another app.\n\nAt Cannes Lions 2017, we did something similar (though perhaps less patentable). We hooked our natural language processing system to Foursquare, Google Maps and local knowledge bases to help users navigate the tourist destination and conference. The result was a conversational experience that synthesized data from multiple sources to deliver quick answers.\n\nAny company that works with smart devices, such as an Internet of Things startup, can do this. Connecting multiple models with the same set of training data improves the quality of insights delivered and, thus, the customer's experience. Devices hooked together as ensemble models cooperate like a baseball pitcher and catcher: Because they're working from the same data set, they're able to jointly decide how to approach a task from opposite sides.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways to Get User Data Without Ruining the User Experience\n\n4. Alibaba: Customize customer journeys.\n\nA whopping 500 million people shop with Chinese retail giant Alibaba, more than the entire U.S. population. Each of those customers goes through a separate and distinct journey, from searching to buying. How does Alibaba track and tailor each of those 500 million journeys? With machine learning, of course.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways You Can Use AI to Enhance Every Step of the Customer Journey\n\nAlibaba's AI should make every e-tailer jealous. Its virtual storefronts are customized for each shopper. Search results turn up ideal products. Ali Xiaomi, a conversational bot, handles most spoken and written customer service inquiries. Every element of Alibaba's business feels like it was built for the shopper engaging with it, and every action the shopper takes teaches the machine more about what the shopper wants.\n\n5. Spotify: Deliver personalized media.\n\nAfter acquiring two machine learning startups in 2017, Spotify, which I used to work with, is quietly testing out new features for its fan-favorite music recommendation service.\n\nLast December, a Mashable writer noticed \"like\" and \"don't like\" buttons in her Discover Weekly feed. While Spotify has been tight-lipped about its intentions in acquiring video recommendation startup MightyTV in March 2017 and music personalization startup Niland just two months later, it likely did so to refine its AI stack and outsmart other music services.\n\nSpotify's bet on Discover Weekly speaks to the premium music consumers place on personalization, made possible through its innovative use of machine learning. Even Spotify is surprised by Discover Weekly's success, which wasn't part of the music streaming company's offerings when it launched in 2007. Copycat services like Apple's New Music Mix quickly cropped up after Discover Weekly's 2015 debut, but they've struggled to surprise listeners with recommendations like Spotify's service does.\n\nOf course, machines can't learn everything about a business or its customers. But companies like Apple, Spotify and Alibaba are pushing that boundary back further and further. Now, with machine learning making disruptive innovation easier than ever before, it's up to entrepreneurs to show the big kids how it's done.", "author": ["Vince Lynch"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/aLeocfFuxo4/310855", "published": "2018-03-24T12:00:00", "title": "The Tax Reform Checklist: Is Your Business Ready?

Apply now. Apply now \u00bb\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWhen I started my career in data 15 years ago, I could never have envisioned a sexy rebranding of my work with the coining of the term \"data scientist,\" let alone the immense popularity it's achieved in recent years. Widely considered one of the worlds hottest and most sought after positions, data scientists are re-writing what it means to be cool in the modern tech era. There has never been a better time for my fellow nerds. Jobs are overflowing with demand far exceeding supply. The industry has become so hot it's not uncommon for board members of startups to demand hiring of data scientists early in the product life cycle. It is in that capacity that I'm frequently brought in to meet with executives and more often than not, inform them that they do not need a data scientist.\n\nRelated: Who Owns the Data Your Business Uses? Not Knowing Could Hurt the Sale of Your Company.\n\nHow can a data evangelist such as myself argue this sudden interest in all things data science is on the verge of backfiring? Before I begin, let me start by saying that there are indeed many great uses for hiring a data scientist! I'm not going to argue that data science is not needed or is not useful, because when used correctly it's an incredibly powerful business weapon (yeah, I went there with \"weapon\"). I'm simply going to argue it's an overused term with little formal accreditation that refers to a large swath of data-related activities, not a tidy suite of skills that can be learned in a 12-month course. So, when it comes time to hire, organizations should put real thought and consideration into when and what kind of data scientist your organization needs.\n\nWhen new prospective clients come to me, at least 50 percent of the time it's under the guise of \"My CEO/board member/etc. told me I need to hire a data scientist.\" To which I generally ask the following four questions:\n\n1. How much data do you have?\n\nI say four questions, but many organizations never make it past the first. If you are a startup and you have not launched yet, you do not need a full-time data scientist. Full Stop. In fact, even if you are well-established but with a small customer/product/membership base, again you do not need a data scientist. Why, you ask? Because not surprisingly, data scientists need data. Not just any data will do. Many techniques require a minimum of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points to build.\n\nRelated: 5 Things to Keep in Mind When Using Data for Artificial Intelligence\n\nCurrently, there is a huge focus on deep learning. Job descriptions for data scientists are flooded with terms like neural networks, machine vision and natural language processing (NLP). The issue? These types of techniques rely on having massive amounts of training data. Consider the widely popular Google Translate, a type of neural network built on top of a lexicon of over 150 million words. The volume of data needed for successful deployment of these types of models exceeds what many companies own.\n\nThere are many techniques that use less data than deep learning, however, they still require reasonably large samples, not to mention a working knowledge of when to use which methodology. There is still valuable work to be done at this stage to create an environment where data science can thrive in the future, it just doesn't require a full-time, expensive resource to achieve.\n\n2. Do you have established key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular business intelligence reporting?\n\nWithout basic understanding of what drives the organization, it's going to be very difficult to make use of advanced techniques. For example, a data scientist can use machine learning to make predictions such as which users will churn or become highly active, however, if the business does not have a definition for churn or highly active, that becomes a requirement prior to building the predictive models. Furthermore, it's difficult to validate models if you don't have sufficient metrics with which to evaluate them. Other techniques such as A/B testing require advanced selection of an overall evaluation criteria (OEC), which is typically a business-driven KPI.\n\nRelated: 6 Critical Questions to Help Businesses Cut Through the AI Hype\n\n3. What do you imagine this data scientist will do once hired?\n\nPerhaps the most subjective and interesting of the questions I ask, \"What do you want this data scientist to do?\" The most common answer I get is. \"We don't know, that's why we need to hire one.\" In that case, I gently tell the organization that they are setting up their data scientist to fail. There is no need to be an expert in data science to hire one, however you should have a good idea of what is and isn't possible so that you don't set unrealistic expectations.\n\nData science isn't magic and it's not even a traditional science. It's just as much an art as it is a science, which means the variability in skills and ability is substantial. You may even have existing team members able to grow into many data science applications. An easy entry into data science for an existing analyst is to begin forecasting the KPIs they already report on. Here they have the opportunity to learn on data they are familiar with, which is not just good for employee morale; investing in your staff now means less need to recruit in a highly competitive market in the future.\n\nRelated: What Hiring Managers Don't Understand About Hiring for Data Science\n\n4. What support networks are available to your data scientist(s)?\n\nIf you don't have the right support network for your data scientists, don't bother investing in hiring them. In recent years, there has been a huge surge in data science programs, however the graduates are for the most part simply not ready to tackle business problems without careful hand holding. The vast majority of programs have students solving pre-established problems on clean data. In the real world, you want your data scientist to help determine what problems are being solved, and clean data never exists.\n\nHiring a junior data scientist without a senior resource for guidance can not only lead to frustration on the part of the junior, it can often lead to bad analysis. Junior team members tend to struggle translating business problems into technical problems and the wrong translation could result in months of work on a product that misses the target.\n\nThis problem is not completely mitigated by hiring more senior, partly because certifying your senior hires are actually good and competent is extremely difficult. If you luck out and hire a talented and self-motivated data scientist, she will still need a lot of support at the executive level to succeed. Imagine a situation where models are created but never used because there is no buy-in from team leads. Or where A/B tests are conducted but the results ignored. Worse yet, the data tracking needed to analyze a problem isn't being collected at all.\n\nRelated: 4 Things a Data Scientist Can Do for Entrepreneurs\n\nFrequently, a necessary first step is a robust data collection program, which is likely resourced by an engineer or database administrator, not a data scientist. At many organizations, the senior data scientist(s) spends exorbitant amounts of her time simply fighting for the data requirements and deployment of her team's work. That's a surefire way to lose that talented, self-motivated, senior data scientist.\n\nThe landscape for hiring and retaining good data science talent is competitive and expensive, but being smart and conscientious on when, who and how to hire can mitigate the pain and cost. Don't fall into the trap of job postings that are laundry lists of skills. Don't expect magic pixie dust from your data scientist. Do take inventory of your true requirements and if possible, consult with a trusted professional prior to hiring.

Leaders say, \u201cThe money\u2019s got to come from somewhere,\u201d but companies that don\u2019t qualify for traditional funding are often at a loss as to where \u201csomewhere\u201d might be.\n\nRelated: How to Decide Whether You Need Debt or Equity Financing for Your Business\n\nAnd that's a problem: The Federal Reserve Bank's 2017 Small Business Credit Survey found that 61 percent of employer firms polled had experienced financial problems in the prior year, with nearly half needing additional credit or funds to expand their operations.\n\nOf those, only 45 percent applied for financing; 60 percent of those received less than they requested, and 24 percent received no financing at all.\n\nIn response, many business owners are seeking financing from less mainstream sources.That's why nontraditional financing options have grown in popularity among businesses facing difficult decisions and a need for capital.\n\nWhether they were unable to secure credit because of bad (or nonexistent) credit history, sluggish cash flow or a lack of collateral, these growth-oriented businesses often find they\u2019re not considered a good fit for traditional loans or lines of credit. There are, however, unexpected outlets available to them. I wish they'd been available to me when I started out 20 years ago.\n\nOnline lending\n\nOnline lending became more visible after the 2008 financial crash, when many small businesses absorbed a bigger hit than larger companies did. Online lenders use technology to offer faster turnaround times, increased accessibility and \u201cmore accurate credit scoring algorithms,\u201d according to one Harvard Business School study. Combined, these factors make credit access possible for small businesses that don\u2019t qualify with traditional banks and lenders.\n\nRelated: Looking Further Ahead: Your Business May Do Better With A Non-Traditional Funding Route\n\nWhat's more, the HBS study explained, online lenders not only give struggling businesses capital but also increase competition in the space, and fuel job growth, both of which benefit the U.S. economy and the average consumer.\n\nI was recently at a conference where I was talking with several others about getting access to capital easily. When I first started my accounting practice two decades ago, I couldn\u2019t get a loan to save my life. It almost cost me my practice.\n\nI discovered that I'm not alone. Many others at the conference chimed in on their business and how they faced similar situations.\n\nOnline lending: a case study\n\nPatrick Donohoe, the CEO and president of Paradigm Life, knows these problems first-hand. In 2007, Donohoe launched his business alongside businesses set up by his partners; when the economy crashed a year later, the business collapsed and nearly took Donohoe\u2019s operation with it.\n\nStill, he managed to keep his operation open and even expand it. By 2013, the company had become well established, clearing just shy of $15 million in sales. \u201cDuring the expansion, we used a lot of my personal life insurance cash value as the basis of our strategy,\" Donohoe told me. \"One use is leveraging a guaranteed line of credit against the capital, and I used that to fund operations, employees and marketing.\n\n\"Eventually, we needed excess capital, and when we went to get credit, it was pretty impossible.\u201d\n\nThat's when Donohoe approached a bank he\u2019d worked with previously. But because of a $5,000 credit card that had been charged off with the lender, he met with resistance.\n\nDonohoe also believed he had some leverage there, because the write-off was covered by the bank\u2019s insurance, giving the bank a tax benefit. Yet he still was asked to jump through hoops.\n\nHe offered to tack on interest or put money into a CD and collateralize it, but neither option was accepted. Donohoe next turned to alternative credit sources. But their exorbitant interest rates were crippling.\n\nSo, as a third recourse, Donohoe found Kabbage, an online lender. \u201cOf all the alternatives, it was the one that made sense,\u201d he said. He said he obtained the maximum $250,000 loan by entering his information online and specifying that the funds were for event sponsorships, a marketing campaign and operating capital.\n\nIn 2015, his company's sales rose sharply, to $30 million.\n\nPeer-to-peer lending\n\nPeer-to-peer (P2)) lending, a hybrid of crowdfunding, empowers people with capital to extend their resources to businesses in need. With P2P, an intermediary is used to verify each business\u2019s credit and provide that information to prospective lenders. The intermediary then fields bids and packages the loan at the lowest rate offered by the prospective lenders.\n\nPeer-to-peer is especially helpful for businesses that need small amounts of capital not available from traditional lenders. And it's helpful in another way: The Small Business Administration has noted that P2P lending makes it difficult for lenders \"to discriminate, intentionally or otherwise, on the basis of personal characteristics.\u201d\n\nPeer-to-Peer: a case study\n\nNat Harward uses peer-to-peer as an investment tool for his strategy consulting firm; his first year netted him a return of more than 14 percent, he told Partners 4 Prosperity. \u201cI love efficiency and coming up with better ways to do things,\u201d Harward explained, \u201cSo when I saw that Lending Club uses the internet to take financial middlemen out of the personal loan market, I got excited.\"\n\nThe consultant added that this type of low-risk loan return rate (a little above 6 percent), combined with the high-risk loan rate at 25 percent, made peer-to-peer much more attractive than socking money away in savings.\n\nOne of the benefits, he said, is that lenders can spread their funds across several different recipients, hedging their bets on making a return and helping more businesses in the process. Of course they still have personal standards to uphold: \u201cOne of the Lending Club users I mentored says she looks exclusively for people who write in complete sentences,\u201d Harward said, only half joking.\n\n\"Nontraditional\" becomes mainstream.\n\nBeyond online and peer-to-peer lending, business owners can explore microloans, straightforward crowdfunding and a myriad of other financing options. That\u2019s a good thing: As Donohoe, for instance, pointed out: \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have a medium of exchange, but technology is going to take out the middle men: banks, Wall Street investment firms, insurance companies, the Federal Reserve, central banking ...\"\n\nRelated: Bad Credit? Even an Entrepreneur in Your Shoes Can Score a Loan. Here Are 3 Options.\n\n\"The value of money isn\u2019t important -- what it\u2019s being used for is most important,\" Donohoe continued. \"Our ultimate control is not in the measurement of value, but how much value we produce.\u201d\n\nOverall, nontraditional financing options enable businesses to spur growth and even avoid failure because they lack capital. If both lenders and borrowers are willing to explore new ways of getting money into the hands of those who can do something good with it, both may well see the return they\u2019re hoping for.", "author": ["Peter Daisyme"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/SaSfy0FWod8/310948", "published": "2018-03-23T18:03:00", "title": "Elon Musk Just Deleted His Facebook Account", "text": "/\n\nThe #deletefacebook movement just got a very powerful backer.\n\nMarch 23, 2018 1 min read\n\nTechcrunch reports that Elon Musk has deleted his Facebook account, as well as the official accounts of Tesla and SpaceX.

Now, shoppers in Seattle don't need cashiers.\n\nCertainly, for entrepreneurs, Amazon Go and its new vision of shopping offers exciting opportunities for the future. But, when cashiers become as unnecessary as gas station attendants, where will that labor go? And what will this shift say about the evolution of tech?\n\nA matter of priorities\n\nAustrian economist Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992) defined capital as \"those non-permanent resources which [cannot be consumed directly] to contribute to the permanent maintenance of the income at a particular level.\"\n\nHis definition is a mouthful, but von Hayek was on to something. True, cars don't automatically fill up their tanks when they pull into gas stations; people still have to interact with fuel pumps. But pump technology has become so intuitive that the value of a gas station attendant is lower than the value of that same labor in another industry.\n\nWhat's more, those attendants want to work elsewhere where they can make more money.\n\nThe same situation will soon be true for retail cashiers. While these employees once memorized prices and did math in their heads, today's cashiers drag barcodes over a scanner and place products in bags. Anyone and anything can do that -- many stores already offer self-checkout lanes. So, what Amazon Go's automated process does is call into question the value of cashiers altogether.\n\nWhen a customer encounters an issue at the pump today, that person goes inside the gas station to talk with a worker behind the counter. Stores might soon follow a similar model, employing one or two cashiers to troubleshoot problems but eliminating the need for eight open lanes. This qualifies as a cost-cutting measure that ultimately lowers prices for consumers, but that's not the end of it. The real value of these advancements is not the money saved -- it's the increases in other types of production. The salary of a gas station attendant creates more value when that money is used in different ways.\n\nAdvances like Amazon Go and attendant-free gas stations help both sides of the buying equation. Society as a whole enjoys increased output from workers who are in more productive positions, and those workers earn better wages in more relevant roles. Everyone wins.\n\nLessons entrepreneurs can learn from Amazon Go\n\nTo stay ahead of the curve, entrepreneurs should take lessons from the implementation of Amazon Go and prepare for a world of new opportunities.\n\n1. Embrace technology as a value. Entrepreneurs often use technology to cut costs, but that reasoning in and of itself is flawed. Technology should not serve as a way to spend less; it should offer an avenue to provide more value for customers.\n\nAccording to Chief Executive, the mid-market companies with the highest growth spend more than double the industry average on research and development. That growth doesn't come solely from cost savings -- it stems from increased productivity and new offerings. Any advancement that increases internal efficiency should also provide an external benefit to consumers, such as faster service, better products or lower prices.\n\nRelated: Top 2017 Technology Trends That Will Continue in 2018\n\n2. Stay at the forefront, but don't overextend. Push the boundaries of your comfort zone, but maintain a balance between old and new tech. You don't want to fall behind competitors in terms of technology adoption, but you also don't want to jump on new tech simply for the sake of an upgrade.\n\nBefore implementing any new tech, consider the needs of your customers: How will this affect the customer experience, the quality of product or speed of service? The worst technological investments confuse and repel customers, while the best ones fit seamlessly into their existing expectations.\n\nFor a prime example of what not to do, remember the doomed juicer startup Juicero. This company raised $120 million to create a product no one wanted: a $700 juicer that was slightly less effective than squeezing produce by hand. The tech failed to make customers' lives better, and the company shut down soon after launch.\n\n3. Be prepared, even when you're not investing. Technology will never stop improving. Regardless of whether your company adopts the newest tools, you still need to be aware of how the presence of those tools could affect your marketplace.\n\nStay on top of any technological developments relevant to your industry. Even if you naturally avoid early adoption, you'll at least want to know what's going on and position your company to respond if consumer expectations quickly shift.\n\nHad it not been for Waymo, Google's self-driving car subsidiary, automotive companies might have delayed their own autonomous car initiatives. Once Waymo initiated its driverless car pickup program, though, General Motors and Ford both hustled to announce their own plans for ride-sharing services with their vehicles.\n\nOnce consumers learn to love a new feature, companies that can meet that need will thrive. Those that wait too long to get started will scramble to catch up.\n\n4. Keep tabs on advances in other industries. Some technology has obvious uses, like a customer-relationship management system for a marketing firm. Other technology does not have such clear applications. By thinking outside the box and considering the possibilities of cutting-edge technology from other industries, entrepreneurs can gain unique advantages.\n\nLook for imaginative uses for tech that would increase the value of what your company offers. Could something that works in a different industry help you streamline your own business, expand your offering or reach a new category of customers? Find uses that aren't obvious or being considered by your competitors.\n\nAnother strategy: Create an internal team to evaluate potential uses for new software. Microsoft Garage allows employees to explore new technology and play with unconventional ideas. The fear of failure doesn't exist here; what does is the potential for employees to provide the company with unique technology applications.\n\nRelated: How Technology Is Rapidly Changing the Way Things Get Done Across Industries\n\nIn the end, cashiers won't disappear overnight. New technology requires up-front investments, which most companies are not ready to make. Nor are some consumers comfortable shopping at a store like Amazon Go -- in the same way some drivers didn't want to pump their own gas after attendants began to disappear.\n\nThe future is coming, though. Cashiers will not stick around forever, and new technology will continue to change consumer expectations. By staying on top of trends and investing in the right technology, entrepreneurs can keep pace in evolving industries and create more value for their customers -- as well as jobs for those reduncant cashiers.", "author": ["Per Bylund"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/iycdBol4LgM/309345", "published": "2018-03-23T17:30:00", "title": "The Definitive Guide to Instagram Analytics: So Much More Than Just a Pretty Picture", "text": "/\n\nUse the photo-sharing platform to track your customers and viewers. Then compile the Instagram analytics your business needs. Here's how.\n\nMarch 23, 2018 18 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nLesya Liu is a social media strategist and a photographer. She specializes in combining art and marketing to create compelling storytelling, both visually and textually.\n\nInstagram, the photo- and video-sharing platform, is undoubtedly the hottest social media outlet on the market right now. In fact, it's doubled its user base in just two short years, to 800 million, 500 million of whom are daily users.\n\nReports consistently show that Instagram has the most engaged community on the internet: The platform's posts receive more engagement than any other social network out there -- 84 times more than Twitter, 54 times more than Pinterest and 10 times more than its older sibling, Facebook.\n\nRelated: 14 Eye-Opening Instagram Statistics\n\nAnd all that engagement isn't limited to organic (meaning non-sponsored) posts. Three-quarters of Instagram users take actions such as making a valuable website click after looking at a sponsored post.\n\nSo, marketing on Instagram should seem like a no-brainer to any business owner, right? Yet, most business owners remain hesitant to jump on the Instagram bandwagon.\n\nEven though the majority of businesses are already present on the platform, it's evident from their efforts that Instagram is more of an afterthought than a viable marketing strategy. Low-quality images and content and an overall failure to create a cohesive story line are some of today's most widespread offenses.\n\nCertainly, this is not to put all of the blame on business owners. They're busy people who want to maximize the results they get for their efforts; they want a clear purpose and ROI. So, while marketing gurus scream from the rooftops about the importance of being on Instagram, entrepreneurs are left wondering, What\u2019s in it for me. How do I track traffic? How do I track sales? How can a collection of pretty images translate into a real revenue for a company?\n\nAnd then there's the biggest question of all: How do I interpret the analytics I get to ensure Instagram is an effective part of my marketing funnel?\n\nRelated: 10 Tips for More Instagram Followers\n\nWhat Instagram is -- and isn't.\n\nInstagram offers you, as a business owner, the opportunity to post beautiful photos of your products and of influencers -- famous and not so famous -- using or wearing your products. It lets you include comments from customers (hopefully) urging others to buy those products.The platform also enables companies to make direct sales. What Instagram is not, however, is a selling machine in and of itself.\n\nIn fact, few businesses make money directly off of their presence on the Instagram platform. Unless you\u2019re getting paid for promotions and shout-outs, chances are you won't necessarily enjoy a clear-cut ROI from your efforts, either.\n\nHowever, Instagram can be a very effective part of your sales funnel, if used correctly. Like any other social network, Instagram is an awareness channel, a relationship-building channel.\n\nSo, if you're wondering how awareness and relationship-building can advance your company: First, take advantage of the highly engaged Instagram community. Think of the likes and comments counts not as a vanity metric, but an opportunity to leverage, to your business's benefit, the engagement these comments represent.\n\nThen, make sure that your Instagram presence is aligned with your overall branding. That way, once people land on your Instagram profile, they can be confident that they'll again see what they've seen from you everywhere else.\n\nRelated: Feel the Customer Love With These 9 Instagram Stories Tips Straight From the Source\n\nOnce you've got those two major goals covered, follow the specific advice points below.\n\nNathan Chan, the editor-in-chief, however, says of the magazine that it's \"not growing quite fast enough.\" During an interview I did with him on The Social Media Current, Chan told me, \"We started crushing on Instagram purely from just getting very, very good and finding out what\u2019s working, and just consistently providing an amazing content.\"\n\nOf that content, Chan mentioned \"having amazing entrepreneurs on the front covers of our magazines, building that social proof, also having great design [and] using social media -- like Instagram.\n\n\"I think when you do great work,\" Chan continued, \"people are going to be naturally attracted to you.

Start by paying attention to the behavior on your profile. This is the first step to better Instagram marketing, and can answer such questions as:\n\n2. Recognize what types of posts get you the most traction. Determine:\n\nIn an interview for my blog, Jessica Hirsch of @cheatdayeats suggested staying on top of trends and paying attention to industry leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Instagram changing and adding features, so it's important for both personal and business accounts to evolve and grow with it,\" Hirsch told me. \"I do my best to test them out, and before I know it, it becomes part of my new routine. And I think Instagram sort of rewards accounts that adapt well to the changes.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important to move forward with that mindset and understanding to continue to grow on Instagram,\u201d Hirsch added.\n\nRelated: 13 Expert Tips to Help You Build Your Instagram Following\n\n3. Pay attention to the growth of your audience. Prioritize quality over quantity here. Play by the rules and don't risk your Instagram presence by buying followers on Instagram or involving bots.\n\nMake sure that the people following your brand are the right audience fit. Does your Instagram following overlap with your business-target audience? If your ideal audience is middle-aged men, then \"likes\" and \"follows\" from young females won\u2019t translate into sales in real life. A quick look through your follower list should give you a pretty good idea whether or a not a scenario like this is the case.\n\nIf you do sign up for (or convert your existing profile to) an Instagram business profile, you\u2019ll be able to get most of the analytical data you need without leaving the app. Instagram (contrary to popular belief) wants you to succeed, because if you win, it wins.\n\nThat's why the platform is eager to provide you the insight you need to make better content and business decisions. So, explore your audience demographics, such as age, gender and locations; see when your audience is the most active on the platform.\n\nWhat you can achieve\n\nGo for reach and engagement. If you consistently deliver high-quality content to the right target market via Instagram, you'll achieve two things:\n\nStrengthen the connection with an existing audience, because its members will come back for more content;\n\nEnjoy high engagement levels that will help you leverage the Instagram algorithm, thus creating even more exposure for your content.\n\nNot only will you deepen existing relationships, you'll cast a much wider net with a little help from the platform itself. How? Through leveraging the notorious Instagram algorithm to your benefit! (notorious because people don't like the non-chronological order of its newsfeed).\n\nAgain, Instagram is not after you. It's in the platform's best interest to show engaging, relevant content to its users, so that they stay longer on the platform. That's why the algorithm\u2019s only job is to scour through the platform and find awesome content, which will be shown to more and more people.\n\nRelated: How to Make Your Instagram Account Impressive\n\nWhat started as a three-month-long European sabbatical with her boyfriend (now husband) Jacob Taylor turned into a blog about their amazing travels. \"There was no strategy when we first started our Instagram,\" Selena Taylor told me in an interview. \"The plan was to share photos from our adventure with friends and family, but since we both love photography, it quickly turned into a passion project for the two of us. It wasn\u2019t until we used hashtags for the first time, and our photo was reposted within minutes by a larger account (@dametraveler), that we started paying attention to the potential Instagram had to reach others who were traveling or wanted to travel.\n\nSelena and Jacob found ways to improve their photos and style while simultaneously interacting with others who were on the road; and, \"Things just grew from there,\" Selena said. \"When we started our Instagram, no one was using the word \u2018Influencer\u2019!\"\n\nBut then things heated up: The couple was first approached by sponsors when their account had around 10,000 followers.\n\nThese days, the duo satisfy their wanderlust while making money through strategic partnerships with big brands. Continued Taylor: \"It all depends on the project, but typically our trips are sponsored in exchange for promotion, or we\u2019re hired by a hotel or tourism board for paid photo and video projects.\n\n\"It\u2019s really important to us that we feel passionate about the place and the content we can produce,\" she told me. \"We\u2019re also always considering our audience -- will they respond to the content and the destination? Our favorite compliment is when people tell us they were inspired to go somewhere that they never would have thought to travel to.\"\n\nImage credit: @finduslost\n\n\n\nHowever, the couple wouldn't have been able to earn income through sponsored blog posts and Instagram posts if they hadn't been very clear on their audience and the aesthetics of their own brand, Taylor said. She described \"a lot of pressure\" to constantly produce more, \"but we\u2019ll always prioritize quality over quantity.\"\n\nWhat's happened since has been the couple's ongoing effort to improve their photos, share guides from the cities and countries they've visited, guest-blog and create videos. \"We fell in love with the creative aspect of what we started together,\" Taylor said.\n\nTo get in on this, pay attention to Instagram's \"Explore\" section, where Instagram curates images relevant to the viewer's interests and the handles he or she is following. This is also where all of the best content is displayed, though you might have noticed that not all posts have thousands of likes. Instagram's updated algorithm now customizes your Explore section to your interests and finds handles of all sizes to show to you.\n\nSomething similar could work for your business: Even if you don\u2019t have an impressive following, but your engagement rate is great in proportion to your following, your content will appear in the \"Explore\" section for relevant interests, among some of the top content creators. (And that\u2019s all you need, really.)\n\nIn short, get to know Instagram's algorithm by leveraging the information that the network provides. Post content that provokes engagement from the right people at the right time, i.e., when they\u2019re on the network.\n\nAs Foundr's editor, Chan, told me: \u201cWe use Iconosquare to know when to post and the most engaged and liked images on our feed. We look out for follower growth. If our account is still growing daily by at least 700 new followers, we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Evaluate Your Instagram Profile Performance\n\nTrack your website traffic from Instagram (Wait: You can track that?)\n\nWhat\u2019s even more important to track is the traffic flow going from Instagram to your own channel. While Instagram is an awesome platform, you don't own it; thus, your business presence and following there is at the mercy of the next algorithm change.\n\nSo, be strategic and try to direct as much of this Instagram traffic as you can to the channels you do own and have control over. Send visitors to your website.\n\nThis will take some effort on your part: If you simply insert your website URL into your Instagram bio, you're missing out on a lot of insightful data.\n\nHere are several moves I recommend to gain the insight you need from Instagram analytics.\n\n1. Build a special landing page.\n\nThis is a page created specifically for people to \u201cland on,\u201d meaning the first page they see on your site.\n\nHome pages tend to create an aerial view of the company, with tons of links going in multiple directions. Keep in mind that these people have already had a first touchpoint with your brand on Instagram, and that they clicked on the link to learn more.\n\nPlus, remember that Instagram traffic is mostly mobile, so ensure a pleasant mobile experience on your mobile page by not cramming a ton of stuff onto it.\n\nMake it as clear as possible what you want your visitors to do.\n\nYou can do this through a brief email sign-up form, to continue the conversation with them and build a longer-lasting relationship, which in turn may open up opportunities for direct sales.\n\nYour landing page also needs to have a unique URL not found in any other way, except for a link in your Instagram bio. This is how you'll know that all of the traffic coming to this page is, in fact, coming directly from Instagram. And, that will tell you exactly how many people clicked on that link.\n\nRelated: Instagram Analytics: Which Metrics Really Matter?\n\n2. Include a trackable link.\n\nUse URL shorteners such as bit.ly or ow.ly, or better yet, Google URL Builder (which lets you create uniform and universal UTM links). If you needed any further proof of the importance of this step, know that Foundr uses UTM parameters as much as possible. (\"UTM,\" by the way, refers to URL parameters which marketers use to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.)\n\nWhat does this achieve? When you go into the Acquisition tab in your Google Analytics, you\u2019ll see traffic acquisition from all sources, including what percentage of it is social and what percentage comes from Instagram.\n\nOnce users switch between applications (from Instagram to an internet browser in this case), the technology will strip away the data that comes with it.\n\nIt will count Instagram traffic as \u201cdirect,\u201d meaning it had no referral source, when in fact the visitor was referred from Instagram. See now how you could have been unfair to Instagram as a marketing channel this whole time because your analytics did not give this platform a proper credit?\n\nRelated: How to Create a Killer Instagram Ad in Under 10 Minutes\n\nSo, what exactly were those visitors doing at your site?\n\nThrough the combination of a special trackable link and an exclusive landing page, you'll see exactly what Instagrammers are doing on your website. Not only will you know how many people came from Instagram, but you'll be able to see how long they stayed on any given page.\n\nYou'll also see whether they took any next steps, and which links engaged them most. From there, you can track visitors' engagement and behavior by how much time they spent on a given page, whether they clicked anywhere else on your website and what the bounce rate was (the percentage of people that left the site from the same page they entered, without engaging with the content on any other page).\n\nThe information you gain will be a huge hint about how engaging customers' first experience with your website has been. You can also easily analyze people's interest in learning more about your offering by collecting email for a newsletter or a webinar signup. (If they sign up, you've done something right!)\n\nAnd, now, that sweet word for every entrepreneur ... sales.\n\nIf you've got something to sell and your operation is relatively low-ticket, offer visitors a discount code right away. You can then divide the number of instances where a coupon is used by the total number of people coming from Instagram, to gain a simple and straightforward conversion rate. Once again, that's:\n\nInstances where a coupon is used (divided by) the total number of people coming from Instagram = conversion rate\n\nYou can then use all of this insight to work backwards and polish your sales funnel. If fewer people from Instagram are visiting your website than you would have liked, you'll need to craft a more engaging Instagram profile bio for your business and a more enticing offer for them to click on.\n\nWhat's important is, if they do come to your landing page but don't spend enough time there, or go anywhere else on your site, you'll know you have to rework and optimize your landing page. Conversely, if people do spend a lot of time on your site, engaging with it and reading different pages without converting into paying customers, you'll know you'll need to polish your sales message.\n\nThat way, you can focus on addressing those visitors' hesitation, or simplify your sales funnel and make things more straight-forward.\n\nRelated: 14 Free Tools Every Solopreneur Needs\n\nThat constant loop of feedback\n\nInterestingly, website behavior can also hint at what your followers on Instagram want to see more of when it comes to the content you produce. Taylor, of @finduslost, shared this process with me, writing that: \u201cWhen it comes to Instagram engagement, we\u2019re always paying attention to what is resonating with our followers. I check our Google Analytics daily to analyze our blog traffic and the channels our readers are coming from.\n\n\"To me,\" Taylor continued, \"the most valuable information to pay attention to is how long the average user is spending on our site, what posts they are clicking on and where they are going next. I use this data to inform my content decisions, and I also keep it top of mind when making adjustments to my website design.\u201d\n\nChecking your Instagram analytics every month.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed all these steps and put a simple process into place for the behavior analysis I just outlined, you'll see the traffic you get from Instagram, the quality of this traffic (how engaged these people are) and, finally, the means for calculating the conversion rate at which this traffic converts into paying customers.\n\nDo this calculation at least monthly to gain a clear picture of your Instagram performance. With this process in place, you'll gain an understanding of the areas that need optimization to improve your metrics -- whether that means higher traffic volumes, more engagement on your website or an increase in sales. Once you know these metrics and how much money your business made directly from visitors who came from Instagram, you can easily justify using this platform as as an effective business tool.\n\nIn sum, Instagram may trick many business owners into the perception that it's a simple tool, that it's cutesy or even juvenile, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, as a business owner, you should recognize how this platform can provide you with an immense exposure to the right people.\n\nYou just have to find them and strike up a conversation that will enable you to take them through your sales funnel.\n\nThen, once you begin to track results, you'll find that marketing on this platform will become almost effortless. With the rich insights you'll gain from your Instagram analytics, you'll begin to see Instagram marketing as a constant feedback loop, where you gain more understanding of your audience members and their content needs, which in turn will bring more traffic to your website and (hopefully) a bunch of new conversions of your visitors into actual paying customers.", "author": ["Lesya Liu"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/tqt5tuXCx00/310930", "published": "2018-03-23T17:00:00", "title": "This Introverted Entrepreneur With an Oprah-Approved Brand Shares How to Rise Above Fear to Embrace Every Opportunity", "text": "/\n\nCarol's Daughter founder Lisa Price says getting out of your comfort zone is what makes you a strong leader.\n\nMarch 23, 2018 10 min read\n\nA Note From The Editor Think your company has what it takes to make our Top Company Cultures list?

She wanted to create natural skin-care and hair-care products that would be used and loved by everyone, no matter their skin type or hair texture.\n\nWith $100 and encouragement from her mom, Carol, Price started experimenting with formulas in her Brooklyn kitchen. It wasn\u2019t long before her products were selling out at local markets and festivals.\n\nShe opened her first storefront in Brooklyn in 1999 and with the launch of CarolsDaughter.com the following year, she built a devoted following in the early days of ecommerce. In 2002, Price found a fan in Oprah Winfrey and made an appearance on her show, gaining a whole new group of fans across the country.\n\nPrice\u2019s dedication to making inclusive products with new and interesting ingredients has attracted big name investors including Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith and Jay-Z and partnerships with celebrities including Mary J. Blige. She has also been a fixture on HSN since 2008, a leap that was no small feat for the self-described introvert.\n\nIn 2014, Price sold her company to L'Or\u00e9al and today, Carol\u2019s Daughter products can be purchased at retailers including Dillard\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, Sephora, Target and ULTA.\n\nPrice shared her insights about what it takes to stay in business for more than two decades, planting seeds for future successes and how to move past fear and find your voice.\n\nTell me about a time you needed to create an opportunity for yourself or others?\n\nThe business has been around for 25 years this coming May. So we've had to do many new things to stay relevant. One of those was being on HSN. I'm basically a shy person and an introvert. If you had said to me 10 to 20 years ago that I would be selling products on television, I would have told you that you were crazy. The first time that I had to do it, I was totally terrified. I said a little little prayer asking my mom to help me out. But it's a great thing. It's the perfect example of when you step outside of your comfort zone and you do something that makes you more comfortable. In the end it turned out to be great.\n\nWhat was at stake for you? How did you overcome the fear?\n\nI was nervous about messing up. I was nervous because it was live and you can't start over again. I was nervous that people wouldn't relate to me. The people that I saw doing this have been doing it for a really long time. I thought, how do you practice? But usually when I'm in situations like that I have to think about why I'm there. Most of the time I'm there because I'm supposed to be there. I didn't get there because I forced my way in or pushed my way in. I could see the stars align, if you will. And the door opened and even though I was afraid, all that I actually had to do was walk through the door. In the grand scheme of things that's not terribly difficult to do. It would be much more difficult to bang on the door, convince someone to open the door, pave the way, build the door. I just had to walk.\n\nRelated: You Need to Meet Your Challenges With Pathological Optimism at Every Turn\n\nWhat personal traits or strategies do you depend on to create opportunity for yourself and for others?\n\nWhen you're in a difficult moment, you can get lost in that moment and that moment can feel like forever. It can feel like there's no way out. I always have to remind myself this too shall pass because I've been through this more than once.\n\nI sometimes hear my mother's voice in my head because my mother was diagnosed at the age of 22 with an illness called polymyositis. It's a neurovascular disease, but the way that it manifested in my mom was she had difficulty with her legs. They would cramp up, they weren't very strong. If she sat down and crossed her legs, she actually lifted one leg over the other. She couldn't pick it up off the floor and just cross it. But if you didn't know her and you didn't know that that was part of her reality, you didn't know. Because she didn't focus on it. She didn't complain about it. She didn't talk about it and she lived her life to the best of her ability with it. She was like this constant example.\n\nYou can have something wrong with you. But you can still function, you can still live, you can still be strong, you can still be powerful. It's not that you're ignoring that there is something wrong with you, you're just not letting it be the primary focus. So when I'm in difficult situations I remember that I came from her and I might not feel it right there in that moment but I'm stronger than I think I am.\n\nWhen you experience a setback, what do you do to keep going? How do you get unstuck?\n\nI allow myself time to mourn or grieve. Sometimes you don't have that luxury. I know it sounds weird but you kind of have to postpone that mourning and grieving. When appropriate I allow myself the release of crying. I used to think that crying meant that you were weak and that there was something wrong with it. But energy manifests in different ways. Some people cry or laugh or yell, but you can't keep them bottled up. You have to release it, you have to let it go. When appropriate I let it go so that it doesn't hurt me by keeping it inside.\n\nOnce I've done those two things then I'm able to look at the situation. What could I have done differently if anything? Did I do anything to contribute to what occurred and what is a lesson that I need to learn from this? Most of the time it just is what it is and it's the cycle of life. It has ups and downs. The goal is to learn as much you can but not let it consume you and not let it defeat you the next time.\n\nRelated: Why You Have the Wrong Idea About Who Is a Great Mentor\n\nPeople who want to advocate for themselves don\u2019t know always know how. What are actionable steps they can take to make themselves heard? What steps do you take?\n\nI've been in situations where I needed to negotiate but I didn't know how to negotiate. I was afraid of negotiating and I was afraid that negotiating [would make] the deal go away. So I didn't negotiate. The next time I needed to negotiate, I was able to talk to a lawyer, talk to a banker who is a friend of mine, and say OK, I don't want to accept this as it is. I feel like there is room to negotiate. What's the best way for me to do it because I really don't want to piss anyone off? I really don't want to come across as being a difficult person.\n\nThe advice that was given to me at that time was really pretty brilliant. They said, it's a good deal but if you feel that you need those two extra points, they're not egregious. You're within your right to ask for them. I would present it in such a way that they understand that this is what makes you happier, able to function on the task at hand better, and not that it's a deal breaker.\n\nIt was a good perspective for me because then I said OK I'm not being cheated. That fear you have of, are they low-balling me because I'm a woman or because I'm African American. To hear that it was fair took that emotion right off the table. It's gone, it's not in my way. I was able to go into that negotiation very calmly, feeling confident and feeling fair and I actually got what I asked for and now because of that positive experience, if I have to negotiate I understand how to go about it and how to navigate it.\n\nRelated: You Must Ask Yourself This Question Before You Pitch Your Idea\n\nHas there been a counterintuitive or surprising way you've opened doors for yourself?\n\nI've opened doors for myself by being somewhere and not knowing that six months or a year down the road that it was going to lead to this other thing. In the moment being there was difficult and being there didn't make a whole bunch of sense. But there was something in my gut that said you've got to do this. Then you realize later the chain of events that led you to that point. You trace it back to that moment two years ago. When you went to that dumb party when it was raining and you had a cold and shouldn't have been out. But because you were there, you met that person, you had a great conversation. You connected and then a year and a half later she remembered you and whispered your name to the person who needed to hear it and you ended up on The Oprah Winfrey Show. That is honest to God a true story.\n\nWas there a blind spot that you had about leadership and opportunity you worked to change within yourself?\n\nWhen we started to have a chief financial officer, an operating person and a packaging person -- people that had five to 15 years in the beauty business, I said to myself, I need to be collaborative because these people know a lot more than I do. I don't want to be the leader in the room who really doesn't know what she's talking about. What I discovered after years of doing that was I had lost my voice in my own brand.\n\nI learned that I needed to be OK with sitting at the head of the table and be OK with leading even though I didn't have all the answers. I had to be OK with being uncomfortable but that I knew the answers to the most important questions. Everything else I could learn.

Is your startup prepared for the transition?\n\nMarch 25, 2018 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nTake a look around any city sidewalk, classroom, restaurant or waiting room, and you\u2019ll see how prevalent technology has become in our society. In fact, according to a 2018 survey by Pew Research Center, just more than a quarter of consumers say they're \"constantly online.\" But technology could never eclipse real human conversations and interactions, could it?\n\nAccording to Daryl Plummer, managing VP at Gartner, that reality is just a few years away. Plummer believes that by 2020, artificial intelligence tech (such as chatbots) will dominate both our social and business cultures, heading up everything from customer service interactions to lead discovery conversations. And because bots will be trained to deliver targeted messages, have personality and incorporate hyperlocal nuances into conversations, people could find great joy in engaging with them. Before we know it, we could all be conversing more with bots than with our own spouses.\n\nWe can thank today\u2019s information-fatigued consumers for innovative solutions such as this -- and, in part, for the growing popularity of account-based marketing. Rather than wasting time on mass marketing that fails to grab or keep targets' attention, ABM calls for marketers to tailor messages to specific personas or audiences -- ultimately personalizing the brand experience for users and generating more viable leads for the company.\n\nAnd when paired with certain technology, ABM can be a real game changer for businesses, especially resource-strapped startups and time-starved entrepreneurs looking to tip the scales in their favor.\n\nRelated: Don't Let the Hype Around Account Based Marketing Confuse You\n\nMaking ABM work for your startup.\n\nIt's the scaled-back, prospect-focused approach of ABM that's key to effectively engaging your targets and maximizing your team\u2019s efficiency. Each success you have with a targeted account will offer you new insights, skills and tools that will help you expand your marketing efforts as your startup grows.\n\nHowever, the true secret to ABM success is leveraging the right technologies to set your business apart from the others. The best emerging technologies will help you not only target and streamline your efforts, but also track and strengthen your engagement rates, saving you valuable time and money in the long run.\n\nSome technologies are already known to pair well with ABM. For instance, digital footprints can aid in identifying your audience\u2019s unique obstacles, and predictive intelligence solutions can help you anticipate target accounts' needs so you can perfectly time marketing messages. Furthermore, addressability and programmatic buying can enable you to target messaging to those with certain characteristics, such as job title.\n\nBut it's important to investigate less-common technologies and automation systems, too, until you\u2019ve customized a tech package that fits your company\u2019s unique audience, focus, needs and budget.\n\nRelated: 18 Marketing Trends to Watch in 2018\n\nWith your tech choices squared away, your next step is to incorporate them into your business plan. Here are some tips for making the conversion to ABM:\n\n1. Don't be a one-trick pony.\n\nSince 2013, Amazon has been the king of curating product recommendations. You can thank its ultrapersonalized home pages, in part, for teaching targets to ignore email blasts and banner ads that don\u2019t speak directly to them. That\u2019s why ABM emphasizes seizing their attention through personalized messages and customized brand experiences.\n\nThere are really no limits to how creative you can get personalizing your brand message or user experience. But you\u2019ll typically find that the more effort you put into customizing your outreach, the more engagement you\u2019ll get in return -- a top benefit of ABM, according to 83 percent of marketers surveyed by Demandbase.\n\nYou might start out by building personalized landing pages on your company\u2019s website for specific clients and target audiences. Customize these pages with images, text and special offers that fit the audience\u2019s unique preferences, interests and needs. Then, monitor whether these pages draw users back to your site and which features they interact with the most, and adjust your efforts accordingly.\n\n2. Take a course in social intelligence.\n\nWhat really sets ABM -- and potentially your brand -- apart is how you can make each account feel seen, heard, understood and appreciated. Doing so is vital to keeping your contacts satisfied. In fact, 84 percent of marketers told ITSMA that ABM has the highest return on investment of any marketing strategy or program, showing that ABM\u2019s customer-driven approach is key for marketers in retaining and growing business relationships.\n\nHow do you learn all the nitty-gritty details about your contacts so you can craft messages that make a real impact? And how do you keep up with all the changes and challenges they experience over time? A great place to start is by subscribing to a public information service, such as Google Alerts, that allows you to customize search parameters, track company activity and receive alerts whenever changes occur.\n\nTo unveil more minute distinctions, interests and challenges, monitor your target account's online social activity on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter (try the list-building feature). Each new tidbit of information will help you anticipate your contacts' evolving needs, reshape your marketing messages and boost your startup\u2019s value in their eyes.\n\n3. Look beyond sales.\n\nWe all know that networking can be helpful in business. But when you\u2019re working on a smaller scale, recognizing and capitalizing on business connections are frequently a pivotal part of building enduring relationships. It\u2019s often that \u201cwe run with the same crowd, so let\u2019s be friends\u201d connection that pushes target accounts to choose your startup over your competitors.\n\nRelated: How to Reconfigure Your Sales Operations for Account-Based Selling\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that networking for your startup isn\u2019t all up to sales, though. The rest of your team can make valuable connections that propel your business forward, too. In fact, a SiriusDecisions study found that when its clients cross-aligned their product, marketing and sales teams, they saw a 25 percent increase in revenue growth and a 56 percent increase in profitability.\n\nThe ideal way to uncover every valuable business connection your team may have is through the TeamLink feature on the LinkedIn Sales Navigator. With that information, you can then work your connections, get a dialogue going with potential customers and start building rapport that will hopefully lead to a sale.\n\nTechnology isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s infiltrating our social and business lives more and more every day. But that doesn\u2019t mean you need to adopt every form of new technology just to get your brand noticed. Instead, focus your efforts on account-based marketing solutions and technology.

She specializes in combining art and marketing to create compelling storytelling, both visually and textually.\n\nInstagram, the photo- and video-sharing platform, is undoubtedly the hottest social media outlet on the market right now. In fact, it's doubled its user base in just two short years, to 800 million, 500 million of whom are daily users.\n\nReports consistently show that Instagram has the most engaged community on the internet: The platform's posts receive more engagement than any other social network out there -- 84 times more than Twitter, 54 times more than Pinterest and 10 times more than its older sibling, Facebook.\n\nRelated: 14 Eye-Opening Instagram Statistics\n\nAnd all that engagement isn't limited to organic (meaning non-sponsored) posts. Three-quarters of Instagram users take actions such as making a valuable website click after looking at a sponsored post.\n\nSo, marketing on Instagram should seem like a no-brainer to any business owner, right? Yet, most business owners remain hesitant to jump on the Instagram bandwagon.\n\nEven though the majority of businesses are already present on the platform, it's evident from their efforts that Instagram is more of an afterthought than a viable marketing strategy. Low-quality images and content and an overall failure to create a cohesive story line are some of today's most widespread offenses.\n\nCertainly, this is not to put all of the blame on business owners. They're busy people who want to maximize the results they get for their efforts; they want a clear purpose and ROI. So, while marketing gurus scream from the rooftops about the importance of being on Instagram, entrepreneurs are left wondering, What\u2019s in it for me. How do I track traffic? How do I track sales? How can a collection of pretty images translate into a real revenue for a company?\n\nAnd then there's the biggest question of all: How do I interpret the analytics I get to ensure Instagram is an effective part of my marketing funnel?\n\nRelated: 10 Tips for More Instagram Followers\n\nWhat Instagram is -- and isn't.\n\nInstagram offers you, as a business owner, the opportunity to post beautiful photos of your products and of influencers -- famous and not so famous -- using or wearing your products. It lets you include comments from customers (hopefully) urging others to buy those products.The platform also enables companies to make direct sales. What Instagram is not, however, is a selling machine in and of itself.\n\nIn fact, few businesses make money directly off of their presence on the Instagram platform. Unless you\u2019re getting paid for promotions and shout-outs, chances are you won't necessarily enjoy a clear-cut ROI from your efforts, either.\n\nHowever, Instagram can be a very effective part of your sales funnel, if used correctly. Like any other social network, Instagram is an awareness channel, a relationship-building channel.\n\nSo, if you're wondering how awareness and relationship-building can advance your company: First, take advantage of the highly engaged Instagram community. Think of the likes and comments counts not as a vanity metric, but an opportunity to leverage, to your business's benefit, the engagement these comments represent.\n\nThen, make sure that your Instagram presence is aligned with your overall branding. That way, once people land on your Instagram profile, they can be confident that they'll again see what they've seen from you everywhere else.\n\nRelated: Feel the Customer Love With These 9 Instagram Stories Tips Straight From the Source\n\nOnce you've got those two major goals covered, follow the specific advice points below.\n\nNathan Chan, the editor-in-chief, however, says of the magazine that it's \"not growing quite fast enough.\" During an interview I did with him on The Social Media Current, Chan told me, \"We started crushing on Instagram purely from just getting very, very good and finding out what\u2019s working, and just consistently providing an amazing content.\"\n\nOf that content, Chan mentioned \"having amazing entrepreneurs on the front covers of our magazines, building that social proof, also having great design [and] using social media -- like Instagram.\n\n\"I think when you do great work,\" Chan continued, \"people are going to be naturally attracted to you.

Start by paying attention to the behavior on your profile. This is the first step to better Instagram marketing, and can answer such questions as:\n\n2. Recognize what types of posts get you the most traction. Determine:\n\nIn an interview for my blog, Jessica Hirsch of @cheatdayeats suggested staying on top of trends and paying attention to industry leaders. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Instagram changing and adding features, so it's important for both personal and business accounts to evolve and grow with it,\" Hirsch told me. \"I do my best to test them out, and before I know it, it becomes part of my new routine. And I think Instagram sort of rewards accounts that adapt well to the changes.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s important to move forward with that mindset and understanding to continue to grow on Instagram,\u201d Hirsch added.\n\nRelated: 13 Expert Tips to Help You Build Your Instagram Following\n\n3. Pay attention to the growth of your audience. Prioritize quality over quantity here. Play by the rules and don't risk your Instagram presence by buying followers on Instagram or involving bots.\n\nMake sure that the people following your brand are the right audience fit. Does your Instagram following overlap with your business-target audience? If your ideal audience is middle-aged men, then \"likes\" and \"follows\" from young females won\u2019t translate into sales in real life. A quick look through your follower list should give you a pretty good idea whether or a not a scenario like this is the case.\n\nIf you do sign up for (or convert your existing profile to) an Instagram business profile, you\u2019ll be able to get most of the analytical data you need without leaving the app. Instagram (contrary to popular belief) wants you to succeed, because if you win, it wins.\n\nThat's why the platform is eager to provide you the insight you need to make better content and business decisions. So, explore your audience demographics, such as age, gender and locations; see when your audience is the most active on the platform.\n\nWhat you can achieve\n\nGo for reach and engagement. If you consistently deliver high-quality content to the right target market via Instagram, you'll achieve two things:\n\nStrengthen the connection with an existing audience, because its members will come back for more content;\n\nEnjoy high engagement levels that will help you leverage the Instagram algorithm, thus creating even more exposure for your content.\n\nNot only will you deepen existing relationships, you'll cast a much wider net with a little help from the platform itself. How? Through leveraging the notorious Instagram algorithm to your benefit! (notorious because people don't like the non-chronological order of its newsfeed).\n\nAgain, Instagram is not after you. It's in the platform's best interest to show engaging, relevant content to its users, so that they stay longer on the platform. That's why the algorithm\u2019s only job is to scour through the platform and find awesome content, which will be shown to more and more people.\n\nRelated: How to Make Your Instagram Account Impressive\n\nWhat started as a three-month-long European sabbatical with her boyfriend (now husband) Jacob Taylor turned into a blog about their amazing travels. \"There was no strategy when we first started our Instagram,\" Selena Taylor told me in an interview. \"The plan was to share photos from our adventure with friends and family, but since we both love photography, it quickly turned into a passion project for the two of us. It wasn\u2019t until we used hashtags for the first time, and our photo was reposted within minutes by a larger account (@dametraveler), that we started paying attention to the potential Instagram had to reach others who were traveling or wanted to travel.\n\nSelena and Jacob found ways to improve their photos and style while simultaneously interacting with others who were on the road; and, \"Things just grew from there,\" Selena said. \"When we started our Instagram, no one was using the word \u2018Influencer\u2019!\"\n\nBut then things heated up: The couple was first approached by sponsors when their account had around 10,000 followers.\n\nThese days, the duo satisfy their wanderlust while making money through strategic partnerships with big brands. Continued Taylor: \"It all depends on the project, but typically our trips are sponsored in exchange for promotion, or we\u2019re hired by a hotel or tourism board for paid photo and video projects.\n\n\"It\u2019s really important to us that we feel passionate about the place and the content we can produce,\" she told me. \"We\u2019re also always considering our audience -- will they respond to the content and the destination? Our favorite compliment is when people tell us they were inspired to go somewhere that they never would have thought to travel to.\"\n\nImage credit: @finduslost\n\n\n\nHowever, the couple wouldn't have been able to earn income through sponsored blog posts and Instagram posts if they hadn't been very clear on their audience and the aesthetics of their own brand, Taylor said. She described \"a lot of pressure\" to constantly produce more, \"but we\u2019ll always prioritize quality over quantity.\"\n\nWhat's happened since has been the couple's ongoing effort to improve their photos, share guides from the cities and countries they've visited, guest-blog and create videos. \"We fell in love with the creative aspect of what we started together,\" Taylor said.\n\nTo get in on this, pay attention to Instagram's \"Explore\" section, where Instagram curates images relevant to the viewer's interests and the handles he or she is following. This is also where all of the best content is displayed, though you might have noticed that not all posts have thousands of likes. Instagram's updated algorithm now customizes your Explore section to your interests and finds handles of all sizes to show to you.\n\nSomething similar could work for your business: Even if you don\u2019t have an impressive following, but your engagement rate is great in proportion to your following, your content will appear in the \"Explore\" section for relevant interests, among some of the top content creators. (And that\u2019s all you need, really.)\n\nIn short, get to know Instagram's algorithm by leveraging the information that the network provides. Post content that provokes engagement from the right people at the right time, i.e., when they\u2019re on the network.\n\nAs Foundr's editor, Chan, told me: \u201cWe use Iconosquare to know when to post and the most engaged and liked images on our feed. We look out for follower growth. If our account is still growing daily by at least 700 new followers, we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Evaluate Your Instagram Profile Performance\n\nTrack your website traffic from Instagram (Wait: You can track that?)\n\nWhat\u2019s even more important to track is the traffic flow going from Instagram to your own channel. While Instagram is an awesome platform, you don't own it; thus, your business presence and following there is at the mercy of the next algorithm change.\n\nSo, be strategic and try to direct as much of this Instagram traffic as you can to the channels you do own and have control over. Send visitors to your website.\n\nThis will take some effort on your part: If you simply insert your website URL into your Instagram bio, you're missing out on a lot of insightful data.\n\nHere are several moves I recommend to gain the insight you need from Instagram analytics.\n\n1. Build a special landing page.\n\nThis is a page created specifically for people to \u201cland on,\u201d meaning the first page they see on your site.\n\nHome pages tend to create an aerial view of the company, with tons of links going in multiple directions. Keep in mind that these people have already had a first touchpoint with your brand on Instagram, and that they clicked on the link to learn more.\n\nPlus, remember that Instagram traffic is mostly mobile, so ensure a pleasant mobile experience on your mobile page by not cramming a ton of stuff onto it.\n\nMake it as clear as possible what you want your visitors to do.\n\nYou can do this through a brief email sign-up form, to continue the conversation with them and build a longer-lasting relationship, which in turn may open up opportunities for direct sales.\n\nYour landing page also needs to have a unique URL not found in any other way, except for a link in your Instagram bio. This is how you'll know that all of the traffic coming to this page is, in fact, coming directly from Instagram. And, that will tell you exactly how many people clicked on that link.\n\nRelated: Instagram Analytics: Which Metrics Really Matter?\n\n2. Include a trackable link.\n\nUse URL shorteners such as bit.ly or ow.ly, or better yet, Google URL Builder (which lets you create uniform and universal UTM links). If you needed any further proof of the importance of this step, know that Foundr uses UTM parameters as much as possible. (\"UTM,\" by the way, refers to URL parameters which marketers use to track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.)\n\nWhat does this achieve? When you go into the Acquisition tab in your Google Analytics, you\u2019ll see traffic acquisition from all sources, including what percentage of it is social and what percentage comes from Instagram.\n\nOnce users switch between applications (from Instagram to an internet browser in this case), the technology will strip away the data that comes with it.\n\nIt will count Instagram traffic as \u201cdirect,\u201d meaning it had no referral source, when in fact the visitor was referred from Instagram. See now how you could have been unfair to Instagram as a marketing channel this whole time because your analytics did not give this platform a proper credit?\n\nRelated: How to Create a Killer Instagram Ad in Under 10 Minutes\n\nSo, what exactly were those visitors doing at your site?\n\nThrough the combination of a special trackable link and an exclusive landing page, you'll see exactly what Instagrammers are doing on your website. Not only will you know how many people came from Instagram, but you'll be able to see how long they stayed on any given page.\n\nYou'll also see whether they took any next steps, and which links engaged them most. From there, you can track visitors' engagement and behavior by how much time they spent on a given page, whether they clicked anywhere else on your website and what the bounce rate was (the percentage of people that left the site from the same page they entered, without engaging with the content on any other page).\n\nThe information you gain will be a huge hint about how engaging customers' first experience with your website has been. You can also easily analyze people's interest in learning more about your offering by collecting email for a newsletter or a webinar signup. (If they sign up, you've done something right!)\n\nAnd, now, that sweet word for every entrepreneur ... sales.\n\nIf you've got something to sell and your operation is relatively low-ticket, offer visitors a discount code right away. You can then divide the number of instances where a coupon is used by the total number of people coming from Instagram, to gain a simple and straightforward conversion rate. Once again, that's:\n\nInstances where a coupon is used (divided by) the total number of people coming from Instagram = conversion rate\n\nYou can then use all of this insight to work backwards and polish your sales funnel. If fewer people from Instagram are visiting your website than you would have liked, you'll need to craft a more engaging Instagram profile bio for your business and a more enticing offer for them to click on.\n\nWhat's important is, if they do come to your landing page but don't spend enough time there, or go anywhere else on your site, you'll know you have to rework and optimize your landing page. Conversely, if people do spend a lot of time on your site, engaging with it and reading different pages without converting into paying customers, you'll know you'll need to polish your sales message.\n\nThat way, you can focus on addressing those visitors' hesitation, or simplify your sales funnel and make things more straight-forward.\n\nRelated: 14 Free Tools Every Solopreneur Needs\n\nThat constant loop of feedback\n\nInterestingly, website behavior can also hint at what your followers on Instagram want to see more of when it comes to the content you produce. Taylor, of @finduslost, shared this process with me, writing that: \u201cWhen it comes to Instagram engagement, we\u2019re always paying attention to what is resonating with our followers. I check our Google Analytics daily to analyze our blog traffic and the channels our readers are coming from.\n\n\"To me,\" Taylor continued, \"the most valuable information to pay attention to is how long the average user is spending on our site, what posts they are clicking on and where they are going next. I use this data to inform my content decisions, and I also keep it top of mind when making adjustments to my website design.\u201d\n\nChecking your Instagram analytics every month.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed all these steps and put a simple process into place for the behavior analysis I just outlined, you'll see the traffic you get from Instagram, the quality of this traffic (how engaged these people are) and, finally, the means for calculating the conversion rate at which this traffic converts into paying customers.\n\nDo this calculation at least monthly to gain a clear picture of your Instagram performance. With this process in place, you'll gain an understanding of the areas that need optimization to improve your metrics -- whether that means higher traffic volumes, more engagement on your website or an increase in sales. Once you know these metrics and how much money your business made directly from visitors who came from Instagram, you can easily justify using this platform as as an effective business tool.\n\nIn sum, Instagram may trick many business owners into the perception that it's a simple tool, that it's cutesy or even juvenile, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, as a business owner, you should recognize how this platform can provide you with an immense exposure to the right people.\n\nYou just have to find them and strike up a conversation that will enable you to take them through your sales funnel.\n\nThen, once you begin to track results, you'll find that marketing on this platform will become almost effortless. With the rich insights you'll gain from your Instagram analytics, you'll begin to see Instagram marketing as a constant feedback loop, where you gain more understanding of your audience members and their content needs, which in turn will bring more traffic to your website and (hopefully) a bunch of new conversions of your visitors into actual paying customers.", "author": ["Lesya Liu"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/uquhxTSnU3o/310427", "published": "2018-03-23T16:00:00", "title": "6 Innovative Ways to Increase Brand Awareness", "text": "/\n\nWendy's sassy Twitter feed is a great example of how to stand out in a sea of noise.\n\nMarch 23, 2018 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nHaving a solid, trusted brand is important for your company to thrive.

The relationship is mutually rewarding, Mastrandrea said.\n\nRelated: Your Personal Branding Strategy in 10 Steps (Infographic)\n\nCompanies can also offer to sponsor influencers at an event (if they do that sort of thing) and even use them as spokespersons for their brand and product(s). A lot of CrossFit-related companies do this, including Rogue Fitness, which sponsors certain athletes with clothing. The athlete then becomes a walking billboard for the company.\n\n2. Use branded packaging.\n\nHave you ever received an order that came in branded packaging? Rather than see it as just another shipment, perhaps you felt that that that special branding made the package seem like a gift.\n\nPacklane is a company that allows companies to design custom packaging, using their own logo and branding to enhance the customer experience. The team has created unique boxes for L'Oreal, HP, Shopify and RedBull, to name a few.\n\nThe team knows that the product experience doesn't commence at first use, but rather at the unboxing stage. How companies present their brand, and the story they tell through their design and graphics, can create an emotional connection with the customer that may last even longer than the product itself.\n\nBranded packaging offers an additional touchpoint to the value your brand gives to each customer\u2019s experience, and helps distinguish you from marketplace competitors. Overlooking your product\u2019s packaging is a missed branding opportunity in today\u2019s ultra-competitive market landscape.\n\n3. Do your SEO research.\n\nHave you heard that the majority of consumers don\u2019t look past the first page of search results, and the majority of people in that group don\u2019t look past the first few results on the page?\n\nThink about how powerful that SEO is for companies pitching to prospects. If competitors are all citing the same information, though, it loses some of its power because of all those companies trying to get new clients.\n\nResearching SEO strategies related to your niche, products or services can help you increase brand awareness. This research will set you apart as an expert and leader in your industry. Jaaxy.com is a great tool that helps you conduct the right type of research because it provides specific keyword research.\n\n4. Double-down on social.\n\nInstagram is a social media platform with power. It\u2019s said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Instagram lets you promote that story via the image(s) you post and the text you narrate. It\u2019s a great tool for friends and family to keep up with one other, and it's just as good for brands reaching out to their consumers.\n\nAzazie sells bridesmaids' and bridal wedding gowns. To do that, it's become hyper-focused on growing its social communities, especially on Instagram.\n\nThe reason is that on that platform, the company can ask new brides to share images of their special day -- and their experiences with Azazie's dresses. Not surprisingly, Azazie's Instagram page is full of beautiful photos that inspire other brides-to-be to imagine themselves in one of its gowns.\n\nBest of all, Azazie harnesses the power of social proof by leveraging testimonials (and personal images) from the customers it's helped make gorgeous brides and bridal party members.\n\nThen there's Facebook: Like Instagram, Facebook has the power to increase brand awareness and create a community. Gallant Dill is a self-made entrepreneur who's built a community through his Facebook group. Dill's business is a mentoring program which teaches entrepreneurs how to build and scale their companies.\n\nFacebook helps him speak directly to this community and share the results of his different mentoring programs and products. Just 26 years old, he has multiple multi-million dollar businesses, a feat which testifies to his intelligence but also to the power of social communities.\n\n5. Step up your game on Twitter.\n\nTwitter is yet another big social media platform for brand awareness because it helps you publish news and interact with customers already talking about your business.\n\nWendy\u2019s, for instance, has built a reputation on Twitter and increased its brand awareness by responding to media mentions of its brand, as well as competitors\u2019 posts with quippy, sassy and hilarious remarks. One of the best examples occurred when a user called out the company, asking where the closest McDonald's was.\n\nWendy's responded with a trash can image.\n\nThen there are Wendy's tweets (here are some examples shared by BoredPanda). Whether you like Wendy\u2019s or not, it\u2019s hard not to appreciate its roasts -- and keep the brand top of mind.\n\n6. Take advantage of Google\u2019s AdSense auto ads.\n\nFinally, paid ads are a great way to get your name and website in front of your target audience, but narrowing down your audience and getting your pitch just right can be tricky.\n\nGoogle recently announced its new AdSense Auto ads, which show publishers the best place to create and optimize their ads.\n\nThrough machine learning technology, Auto Ads can be automatically placed on sites that are best for your brand. There, they effectively reach your target audience, giving you a greater return on investment.\n\nRelated: Why Converting to Instagram Business Is Not a Winning Brand Strategy\n\nThese six strategies are great ways to increase your brand awareness and help your company thrive.

What Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Missteps by Gap, Dove and H&M.", "text": "/\n\nGetting diversity right in advertising starts with hiring a diverse team.\n\nMarch 23, 2018 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAnother day, another (lost) dollar.\n\nAs the heads of households, Latina and black women have a combined consumer spending power that will reach over $3 billion in just three years, according to Nielsen. Brands are salivating at the sizable opportunity, but in recent years they have all but alienated these consumers. A few examples:\n\nIn 2016, Gap apologized for an ad in which a young black girl posed next to an older white girl, who propped her arm on the younger girl's head. The ad drew criticism from black consumers.\n\nRelated: The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace\n\nIn 2017, Dove apologized for a GIF advertising Dove body wash. It looped an image of a black woman removing a dark brown t-shirt to reveal a white woman.\n\nEarlier this year, H&M was forced to apologize for using a black child to model a sweatshirt that read \"coolest monkey in the jungle.\" The image of the child in the hoodie appeared on the British version of the Swedish retailer's online store, but the brand experienced global backlash from consumers and vandalized store locations.\n\nThe point of whether each event deserved the level of backlash it received is irrelevant. Instead, let's discuss the team behind the brand. These became negative incidents because the brands weren't managed by someone who frequently experiences racism or prejudice. And when targeting minority consumers, having this perspective is paramount. For example, a diverse brand manager would have understood black mothers are sensitive to the portrayal of their sons in the media.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Overcome Cultural Barriers at Work\n\nHire a diverse marketing team.\n\nPopular brands such as Dove are comprised of products manufactured by a company. In this instance, Unilever is the company which manufactures Dove. Each brand has a manager who owns the branding process, but they don't work in silos. There are junior marketers, senior executives and customers who also serve as brand stakeholders.\n\nBrand managers analyze and interpret consumer data, uncover market insights and create branding strategies. Once branding strategies are created, a brand manager develops, implements and executes marketing activities. She is responsible for increasing market share by understanding what the consumer needs before the consumer even realizes they need it.\n\nThere's a clear dichotomy between the large global brands -- typically led by mostly (if not all) white brand managers -- and the minority consumer. (If this sounds unbelievable, take a look at the AdAge A-List for 2018.) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 548,000 Americans employed in advertising and communications in 2016, just 4.1 percent are black and 12.3 percent are Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe lack of diversity in the marketing and advertising industry isn't the only problem. Generational shifts in consumer backgrounds exacerbates the divide between brand managers and minority consumers. Case in point: the generation with the largest consumer spending power to date (millennials) is also a generation more diverse than its predecessors.\n\nRelated: Does Your Team Roll Their Eyes When You Talk About Diversity?\n\nHire a diverse marketing team ... and empower them.\n\nSince Latina and black consumers are paramount to sales growth, many businesses are turning to diverse freelancers and multicultural agencies for immediate support. Twenty-nine-year-old Stephanie Caudle, the founder of minority freelance platform Black Girl Group, connects black female freelance creatives to companies seeking to create content specifically for black audiences. She told me the following:\n\n\"These examples (of Dove, Gap and H&M) should illustrate specifically why minority women should have a seat at the table -- to bring true diversity to the forefront and have those tough conversations about why a brand's creative direction might be decisive, racist or discriminative. Unfortunately, when black women on creative teams do choose to speak up they are often viewed as being angry and defensive.\"\n\nFlexjobs.com, the leading online service for professionals seeking freelance jobs, reports more than a third of millennials are already employed as independent workers, and these professionals (also classified as contingent workers) are more likely to be black or Latino.\n\nThe latest Women in the Workplace report from McKinsey & Company and research from LeanIn.Org also echo Caudle's statement. Compared to Latina and white women, black women are least likely to be given \"stretch\" assignments, one which would challenge them and give them opportunities to advance. In the realm of marketing and branding, \"stretch\" assignments would most certainly include leading a creative team of junior marketers.\n\nRelated: Here's Why Diverse Companies Are Better at Innovating Than Homogenous Companies\n\nHire a diverse marketing team ... and respect their candor.\n\nIn the McKinsey report, other women of color said their managers called their candor \"uncomfortable\" for people in the office. Yet, in the marketing and advertising industry candor should be praised. Being frank when marketing campaigns could alienate the brand's consumer segment could avoid negative brand perception, loss in market share or decline in stock price.\n\nOne Chicago marketing firm has not been afraid to be candid with its clients in 47 years, and billion-dollar global companies have reaped the benefits. With annual revenue north of $22 million, Burrell Communications is one of the largest multicultural marketing firms in the world. Founded in 1971, it has built long-term relationships with clients such as Toyota, McDonald's and Coca-Cola, and in turn has helped those brands forge genuine relationships with minority consumers.\n\nIn the decades since its inception, Burrell Communications has seen an increase in the amount of apologies issued from small-business owners, entrepreneurs and the like. In an email interview with current co-CEO of Burrell Communications, Fay Ferguson, she posed the following:\n\n\"As we continue to see brands stumble from both a strategic and executional standpoint, it begs the question, why aren't more companies using African-American agencies? These agencies understand cultural and human sensitivities far better than their general market counterparts. There isn't a lack of talent, there appears to be a lack of willingness to engage ethnic or multicultural agencies despite their proven success records. This is disturbing.\"\n\nMake sure your marketing team takes time to interpret data, connect with your consumers and uncover insights. (For example, if consumer data suggests black mothers aspire to be great cooks, the insight shouldn't lead to an ad that features them dancing while preparing dinner.) If you're not willing to hold all stakeholders -- from junior marketers to senior executives -- accountable for perceptive, relatable content, your consumers will feel alienated. And alienating consumers doesn't increase share of wallet -- it gets you no wallet.\n\nRelated Video: Why Businesses Must Do Better to Integrate This Growing Demographic", "author": ["Christine Michel Carter"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/XeQ91GH0XJ8/309520", "published": "2018-03-22T19:00:00", "title": "How to Write Emails People Will Actually Open", "text": "/\n\nTry these 4 tips to become a welcome sight in your prospect's inbox.\n\nMarch 22, 2018 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMost of the erroneous talk about email's demise comes from those whose email campaigns have failed or those who simply don't like receiving emails to begin with. For companies that focus on their customer experience and consumers who like to stay informed, though, emails are still a vital resource.\n\nRelated: 7 Statistics That Prove Email Marketing Isn't Dead\n\nHow else would brands reach their audience with targeted messaging that can be accessed nearly anywhere? Texting is nowhere near as popular, and for a lot of consumers, every text costs. By contrast, emails are free to receive.\n\nOn top of their convenience, emails cost next to nothing compared to other forms of marketing such as radio and TV. If they fail, it will barely affect your bottom line. But, when successful, an email campaign can yield astronomical returns, in some cases reaching up to 4,300 percent ROI.\n\nThat said, we all hate emails that we don't want to read. The trick, then, is to create emails and campaign strategies that actually engage the consumers you're trying to reach. Learn who they are and what appeals to them, and you can more successfully initiate communication with a few well-crafted emails.\n\nHow to avoid the trash bin\n\nIf consumers don't immediately recognize your email, or if their experience has taught them that your emails aren't useful, then yours are likely to be among those getting tossed.\n\nRelated: 15 Useful Tech Tools for Your Business\n\nThe key to a well-received email is to stand out -- not just in the message, but in the entire marketing strategy that revolves around it. These four tips can help you make that happen:\n\n1. Email people, not groups.\n\nEveryone prefers being talked to rather than talked at. That's why mass-produced emails are almost always trashed. Meanwhile, tailored ones account for up to 58 percent of total revenue for some businesses.\n\nT.J. Macke, VP of client services at Sapper Consulting, explains why the tailored approach is the most important step in business-to-business communications: \"You can't write one email and expect it to have the same impact on all 57 employees at a company you'd like to work with. Know who your audience is, and speak directly to that person.\"\n\n2. Keep it fresh (and useful).\n\nYour personalized emails got the attention they deserve -- now what? One read email doesn't make a campaign successful, but it grabs a consumer's attention. Keep it by using that line of communication to deliver fresh, engaging and useful content.\n\nInstead of just sending an ad, prompt the reader to sign up for your newsletter or join a mailing list for unique offers on premium products. A study by Salesforce revealed that when people sign up for a newsletter, over 95 percent of them actually enjoy receiving the emails because they find them useful.\n\nRelated: How Often Should You Send Marketing Emails?\n\n3. Keep the conversation going.\n\nOutside of newsletters, you can also send special offers to people who opt-in for emails. Because they're expecting you to communicate with them, consumers will be more responsive to these offers. In fact, emails are a significant reason why coupons and special offers still work.\n\nThey're also a great vehicle to take the conversation out of the inbox and onto other platforms. Interactive emails can make it easy for readers to join a webinar, visit a brand's social media pages and even go straight to the checkout on your website, all with the click of a button.\n\nRelated: 5 Email Marketing Tweaks to Double Your Business Revenue\n\n4. Update your address book constantly.\n\nJobs change, lives change and, sometimes, email addresses change. Other times, people may make a mistake inputting their email address or purposely provide a false one. No matter how creative and personalized your email campaign is, it will only work with real, up-to-date addresses.\n\nTo avoid wasting time -- or worse, losing out on a lead -- constantly scrub and verify your email list to weed out false addresses, errors and discrepancies. Emails may be cheap to send, but there's no point sending them where there is no chance of garnering a response or any interaction. An inaccurate list can also complicate your ability to integrate your email campaign into a more comprehensive marketing strategy.\n\nThere's no secret formula for creating an email campaign that's relevant to consumers today. However, it's obvious that emails aren't going anywhere for a long time, and it's worth finding ways to make the most of the medium to build a more direct and personalized marketing strategy.", "author": ["Chirag Kulkarni"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/WtsuKIDyo5U/310119", "published": "2018-03-22T17:30:00", "title": "7 Simple Ways to Build Your Community on Telegram", "text": "/\n\nIf you're using Telegram, there are simple ways to build your following and maximize the utility of the app for your purposes.\n\nMarch 22, 2018 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nTelegram is a recently developed messenger app that in its first 24 hours garnered close to seven million new users, possibly because they like the fact that it combines the features of WhatsApp with those of Snapchat.\n\nRelated: WhatsApp's Epic Fail Was a Rival App's Exponential Gain\n\nThe app allows users to contact other individuals who either have public (and searchable) Telegram usernames or are existing contacts within your phone. Telegram, which comes with an open application-programming interface (API) and protocol, allows users to know when recipients have received and read their messages.\n\nWhile Telegram's capabilities draw parallels to WhatsApp, there's an ephemeral quality to Telegram messages that distinguishes them from WhatsApp's messages. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram sends messages, including photos, with a self-destruct timer that's a lot like Snapchat's.\n\nAlthough those same photos can still be screen-shot before they disappear, the app itself has an enhanced security system, using servers worldwide, which positively affects both security and speed. A secret chat feature uses end-to-end encryption and a time-tested algorithm. And Telegram boasts a combination of high-speed delivery and increased reliability.\n\nRelated: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business\n\nThe app is also cloud-based, allowing users to access their messages from multiple devices; there are no data limits, no fees, no subscription requirement and no ads. The app, further, lifts many of the messaging and file exchange constraints of other applications, allowing users to share and distribute a wide range of information and files without having to toggle back and forth between multiple applications.\n\nIf you're using Telegram, then, here are some simple things you can do to build your following and maximize the utility of the app for your purposes -- plus one thing not to do.\n\nRepost interesting content from your industry or community.\n\nIf you find a document, article, meme or something else you think will interest your followers, be sure to share it. Drawing people into your network by initiating conversations that might interest your community or be of value within your industry is a good way to grow your following.\n\nBe sure to pass along valuable resources, links and concepts, as well. The network you develop can be enhanced by your creating a sense of connectivity around ideas, issues and innovations.\n\nBuild your own tools on Telegram\u2019s API.\n\nTelegram welcomes everyone to use its open source code. Creating your Telegram application provides the six steps that help all developers utilize Telegram\u2019s API and source code in order to create, free of charge, Telegram-like messages on their platforms.\n\nTelegram offers developers more than just the Bot API; users can create their own messaging apps, which offer \u201cexperimental, highly specialized, or locally flavored features.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t advertise 24/7.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Telegram for business, remember that you should be doing more than constantly advertising your business or endorsing your financial interests. People are attracted to situations and sites that promote deeper connections -- not just promotions.\n\nConnectivity, in fact, is key to generating a sense of belonging. Show an interest in your followers and the things that matter to them, and find ways to promote ongoing conversations about things that matter.\n\nRun small contests, sweepstakes or games.\n\nPosing a question or running a small contest draws followers to your site. Giveaways are one idea; incentivizing social sharing is another.\n\nPossible strategies here might involve a \u201clike to win\u201d contest, or the launch of \u201ca selfie\u201d competition. Alternatively, you could design a voting contest that would encourage your followers to engage with one another and with you. Spell out the rules and parameters of your contests, and let your followers take it from there.\n\nLink to your other social media outlets.\n\nTo gain momentum, help your followers find you by linking to your other accounts, including Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and even your LinkedIn. Tying together all your social media accounts will save you time and effort and allow you to easily get messages out across multiple sites.\n\nKeep in mind that while linking to multiple accounts can be a valuable move, you won\u2019t want to overdo it. Each social media site may require a specific voice or tone, so paying proper attention to detail is important.\n\nReturn favors.\n\nIf a follower responds or reposts something, try to return the favor. Paying attention to the interests of your followers goes a long way toward making them feel valuable enough to invite others to your social media.\n\nMarket your social presence.\n\nSimple ways to give your social media presence a boost might include sending out an email blast, starting an interesting business or personal blog or creating compelling audio or video content. Simply inviting your current friends, family and followers to your other sites is another way to increase engagement.\n\nYou may also want to join ongoing online conversations that involve people with a common interest or industry.

With the increase in popularity of using video to communicate a message, many have taken the approach of creating socially aware video content with the hope that what they create will be the next great viral video. With an ever-changing landscape, however, what worked a year ago won't necessarily work now.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Creating Quality Video Content Even If You're Clueless How to Begin\n\n\"Large volume spam campaigns are falling away from productivity,\" Michael Litt, co-founder and CEO of Vidyard, told me when asked about the latest trends, noting that marketing automation is becoming a victim of its own success.\n\nInstead, brands must seek authentic ways to piggyback off trending news while still staying true to their values and authentic brand voice. Burger King started off 2018 with an education video that linked the net neutrality debate to its signature Whopper. What was even more impressive was that it topped Ad Age's viral charts even during the Super Bowl advertisement period.\n\nSo, how can your brand harness the power of video to create social awareness on a viral level in 2018?\n\nMaintaining authenticity\n\nWhen in the planning stages of creating a socially aware video, brands should consider first and foremost how the topic relates to the company's mission and voice. It's not enough to simply jump in on a social issue because it's trending in the news.\n\nRelated: The Ad Messages and Methods That Work Best on YouTube\n\n\"The brand needs to look to its core purpose to find authentic ways to provide real value to its audience,\" Jane Medeiros, vice president of content and creative services at Newscred, which offers a platform for enterprise content marketing, told me by email.\n\n\"Value can mean different things -- it can be educational, beautiful, hilarious or simply useful, but it can't just be a funny tagline anymore.\"\n\nUltimately, Medeiros says people share content that has conviction. If you can make your audience think differently about something they know, or help them discover something they never thought of, that's the recipe for success.\n\nJumping into the political conversation\n\nIt's rare that all the experts agree on something -- but every expert I approached believed brands shouldn't let up when it comes to tackling political issues.\n\n\"It's uncontroversial to say that 2017 was a controversial year,\" said Medeiros. \"In the year of fake news, brands that have been able to align their own core purpose with a moment in current events have been most successful.\"\n\nRelated: 10 Secrets to Going Viral on Social Media\n\nIn February, Airbnb released the #weaccept campaign, announcing a company goal of providing short-term housing during the next five years for 100,000 refugees, disaster survivors and relief workers. The announcement came during the midst of the controversial travel ban issued by the President that halted the United States refugee program and suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees.\n\nThough the announcement was related to a controversial topic, what was announced tied directly to Airbnb's company beliefs that \"no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love, or who you worship, you deserve to belong.\"\n\n\"In the year of fake news, brands that have been able to align their own core purpose with a moment in current events have been most successful,\" said Medeiros.\n\nLitt agrees, saying, \"I believe that the general population appreciates thought-provoking, honest and personalized content that resonates with their personal affiliations, goals and projections of the world they want to live in.\n\n\"It's important to keep in mind that North America contains a more openly politically and socially polarized population than ever before.\"\n\nRelated: The Most Thought-Provoking Ads of 2017\n\nHope Horner, founder and CEO of Lemonlight Media, a video marketing company that produces and distributes branded content, told me by email that she encourages brands to continue embracing the role of politics and social issues in their video content moving into 2018.\n\n\"A year into [President Donald Trump's] campaign, companies are taking a more blatant approach to some of his policies and opinions. People are less afraid of 'ruffling feathers' and more committed to taking a stance.\n\n\"While his reign has divided a nation, it's empowered and strengthened the individual parties. Brands are coming together to unify and share their collective opinions,\" said Horner.\n\n\"I believe this approach will continue to be effective and people that share these brand's beliefs will be further empowered and inspired by their message, and will ultimately share it with their network.\"\n\nTackling social issues\n\nWhen creating socially aware videos, the topic, tone and content are what enable the video to go viral. Cute animals and home video clips may have been enough to elevate the video to viral status in the past, but now socially aware videos need be more brand focused, transparent and authentic, according to Erin Berman, founder and brand storyteller at Blackbeard Studios, a digital creative agency.\n\nRelated: How to Include Politics in Your Marketing Without Turning Anyone Off\n\n\"I think companies are seeing a shift with consumers in that consumers want content that inspires, connects them to the community or teaches them something,\" she told me.\n\nGeneral Electric has a goal to increase the number of women in STEM roles by 2020 and to have 50:50 gender representation in it's entry-level programs. As a way to inspire its audience and display its commitment to these goals, the company created a video in honor of Millie Dresselhaus, the \"queen of carbon science\" and first female Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe video asked the simple question of \"What if Millie Dresselhaus was treated like a celebrity?\" and created dialogue about science and gender roles in the industry.\n\nBeing transparent and authentic doesn't mean your company has to shy away from content that could be considered controversial. When deciding whether or not to handle a controversial topic, brands should be true to their core values and mission so they do not alienate their audience.\n\n\"One tactic we've explored is posing the topic as a question to your audience and remaining somewhat neutral (with your response),\" said Horner. \"This creates a dialogue around the topic but doesn't pigeonhole you into a corner.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Engage Your Customers in Social Good -- And Why It Matters\n\nHeineken's \"Worlds Apart\" video, for example, didn't express a controversial opinion.

To determine the success, review the videos for the following metrics: consumption (actual views), conversion goals such as sales or donations, social sharing and lead generation.\n\nIf creating socially aware videos is something your brand is interested in, be sure to think through and consider all aspects of the video.\n\n\"There is truly something for everyone, and when done in a really powerful and compelling way to captivate an audience, any content has the potential to go viral,\" said Berman.\n\nRelated Video: Consumers Will See Right Through You If Your Social Impact Message Isn't Authentic", "author": ["Kristi Dosh"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/kzai-uqZW8g/310054", "published": "2018-03-22T12:30:00", "title": "How to Make Sure Your Company's Emails Stay Out of the Spam Folder", "text": "/\n\nNavigate the byzantine world of email deliverability and ensure you get the most out of your emails.\n\nMarch 22, 2018 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nEmail is a core channel for almost anyone selling anything online, largely because it offers businesses multiple opportunities to communicate with the person on the other end to build rapport, trust, engagement and hopefully, a sale. All the benefits of communicating with your audience via email go out the window, however, if a damaged deliverability stops your campaigns from ending up in the inbox.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Email Marketing Can Help Boost Ranking In a Hurry\n\nThis is an issue that I and my team at WellPath know all too well. We are a company with an email list of over a million people and a digital marketing strategy that largely revolves around email as one of our core competencies. Thus it was detrimental when, in late 2016, we managed to screw up our deliverability so badly that we were seeing only between 20 and 30 percent of our emails ending up in our subscribers' inboxes.\n\nThis was the sort of existential threat that could shut us down, and fast. It prompted our undertaking a deep dive into the byzantine world of email deliverability. And while we were fortunate enough to come out on the other side even better off than we were before, the process of getting over that massive roadblock was grueling, and could have been made immensely easier had we known then what we know now.\n\nThe question of deliverability is unfortunately one that many marketers don't consider until it's too late, but failing to address deliverability until you need to can spell disaster for your business and sabotage your momentum. To help you stay on the right track, here are a few of the key considerations I've come to find essential in keeping your deliverability -- and your email marketing strategy -- healthy.\n\nUndestand how deliverability works.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that ending up in the inbox versus spam is a virtuous or vicious cycle. The more your emails end up in inboxes and are engaged with, the more the large inbox providers will ensure your emails continue reaching others' inboxes. This in turn usually leads to higher engagement, which means continued improvements to deliverability, and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, the opposite is true as well: Once you start ending up in spam folders it can be increasingly difficult to reverse course.\n\nRelated: How Email Marketing Can Help Build Your Brand\n\nUnderstand the goals.\n\nIf you were about to undertake a journey, you would not do so without a map and a clear sense of a destination. When it comes to your email, figuring out what that destination is requires a firm grasp of the benchmarks for email deliverability and the knowledge that your goals for maintaining strong deliverability need to be performing above these industry benchmarks. According to ReturnPath's 2017 Deliverability Benchmark Report, Global Inbox Placement only measures about 80 percent (with almost 20 percent either in spam or missing) while according to MailChimp's Email Marketing Benchmarks average open rates are between 15 percent to 20 percent with click rates between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent.\n\nKnow the difference between shared and dedicated IP addresses.\n\nMany of the most popular email service providers (ESPs) like Mailchimp will place new clients on shared, well-established IP addresses and rotate clients through those addresses. Meanwhile, there are some ESPs that provide clients with a dedicated IP address that is all their own. If you are an exceptional sender, you have the ability to own and protect your IP reputation so you can outperform the average.\n\nRelated: 6 Keys to Email Marketing Success\n\nAs a business owner, one way to decide between a dedicated and a shared IP address is to ask yourself whether you're at a point where you can afford to dedicate a significant amount of resources to mastering deliverability. If so, consider a dedicated IP address with the understanding that it is going to require a lot of time and energy to manage.\n\nIf not -- and for most early stage businesses, this is most likely the case -- then opt for a shared IP, which does much of the heavy lifting for you. It won't be totally risk-free (ESPs take extreme caution to make sure no business hurts their shared IP addresses, so you'll still have to employ best practices) but your job will be made somewhat easier. Further, the inbox providers who determine your deliverability measure your business also based on your domain reputation, which is tied to your sending domain, and that persists regardless of your ESP.\n\nChart your course.\n\nIt has become de rigueur within the entrepreneurial community to measure the effectiveness of business initiatives with data. Despite that, email deliverability has largely remained a black box. We see our open and click rates, but have little understanding as to why they are what they are. This is in part because the four large inbox providers -- Gmail, Outlook, AOL and Yahoo -- purposefully avoid disclosing too much about deliverability to prevent bad actors from gaming the system. While that leads to a lot of educated guesswork on optimizing deliverability, there are several tools you can utilize to gain more insight into your deliverability performance. Come up with a game plan for utilizing such tools and tracking your deliverability goals. Here are a few of the steps you should take:\n\nSetting up Google Postmaster and monitoring performance\n\nWhat little insight Google does provide regarding why emails end up in spam or other buckets in your inbox can be found in Google Postmaster, a tool provided by Google that provides a deliverability rating (red, yellow or green). Given that Gmail is by far the largest of the big four inbox providers, having this set up from the outset is critical in understanding where you stand.\n\nRelated: Hitting the Marketing Email Sweet Spot With Millennials (Infographic)\n\nMonitoring IP and domain health through online tools\n\nThere are a host of third party tools that enable you to measure your reputation across the major inbox providers. My favorite among these is Delivery Index, a free tool provided by eDataSource, which provides a deliverability breakdown across the four major inbox providers. Other tools worth looking into are Reputation Authority and Talos, which provide data to understand the health of your sending domain and IP address.\n\nMonitoring your presence on blacklists\n\nMultiple blacklists exist which can have a significantly adverse impact your reputation. Some of these lists are ones that you need to proactively request to be removed from (like SORBS), whereas others (like Truncate) will remove you provided that you have no future infractions. Be aware of which is which and actively monitor all of them. MX Toolbox is a great tool that allows you to see which blacklists you are on and provides information about how to remove any infringing IP addresses.", "author": ["Colin Darretta"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/T1uFYRLVRjk/309343", "published": "2018-03-21T17:45:00", "title": "6 More Ways You Can Use YouTube to Reach Your Intended Audience", "text": "/\n\nYouTube can help spread the word about your business.

Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | iBooks | IndieBound\n\nTake a look at the following six ideas for using YouTube as part of your overall online business and marketing strategy.\n\nRelated: 5 Social Media Rules Every Entrepreneur Should Know\n\n1. Showcase customer testimonials\n\nIf you've been in business for a while and have earned the respect of many loyal customers or clients, using a YouTube video to showcase some of these people or companies providing real testimonials for your products/service can be a highly effective and low-cost promotional and sales tool.\n\n2. Present a call to action\n\nBecause YouTube allows you to speak directly to your audience, you can use your videos to encourage viewers to take a specific action after watching your video. A video's call to action is a request for people to take an immediate action -- such as visit your website, \"like\" the video, subscribe to your YouTube channel, call a toll-free phone number, send someone an email, share the video's link with their friends, make a donation or make a purchase.\n\nFor a business selling a product, one potential call to action is to embed a link within your video to a website that offers a money-saving coupon or special offer for what you're selling. This might be 20 percent off the purchase price (for a limited time), free shipping, a buy-one-get-one-free offer or some other incentive to encourage someone to make an immediate purchase. Make it clear within the video that it's an exclusive offer for people watching the video and make the \"special offer\" available immediately at the end of the video.\n\n3. Create mindless entertainment, but use product placement\n\nMany people turn to YouTube for entertainment because the service is chock-full of funny, whimsical and outrageous videos. You or your company can jump on this bandwagon and produce videos that offer mindless entertainment but, at the same time, include subtle product placements or marketing messages about your company or its products within the videos. For this type of video, creativity is essential, as what you post needs to be unique, engaging, funny and entertaining. Again, taking a soft-sell approach is key.\n\nRelated: 10 Proven Ways to Make Millions on Social Media\n\n4. Promote or share highlights from an event\n\nBy default, any type of event in the real world that you or your organization participates in is held at some geographic location and will draw crowds from the surrounding area. However, by sharing videos shot at recently held events, you have the opportunity to share it with the world. Showcasing edited-down (shortened) footage or highlights from a previous event can also generate interest in and help boost attendance for future events.\n\n5. Broadcast (stream) a live event via YouTube\n\nIn addition to filming an event, editing and shortening the video, and then publishing it on YouTube via your company's branded YouTube channel, it's possible to broadcast live via YouTube Live or on other social media platforms like Facebook, YouNow, Twitch.TV, or Instagram Live. When you broadcast live, your video feed steams directly to your audience in real time. In other words, there's no editing, no retakes and no margin for error. As events happen, your audience sees it live.\n\nBusinesses can use live steaming to broadcast a special event, product launch or press conference.\n\nRelated: 12 Social Media Mistakes That Entrepreneurs Make\n\n6. Pay to have your product(s) featured in videos produced by popular YouTubers\n\nInstead of producing your own video content, promoting that content, and using the time, manpower and financial resources required to promote your videos and build an audience, one option that's becoming increasingly popular is to pay an established YouTuber with a large following to incorporate product placements (for your products/services) into their video content. What you'll discover is that the subscribers to popular YouTubers are extremely loyal. So, when one of these YouTubers endorses a product, their subscribers are often very willing to try it out.\n\nMost YouTubers appeal to a specific demographic. So, if you're about to launch a new line of lipstick or nail polish, for example, paying an established YouTuber, who is a beauty guru with a large following, for a product placement is a quick and easy way to promote your product and have it seen by many targeted viewers.", "author": ["Jason R.

Bly\u2019s book The Digital Marketing Handbook. Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | iBooks | IndieBound\n\nYou may think the web is better suited to merchants who sell physical products like books, CDs, home decor, furniture, clothing, toys and the like. But, a well-designed website and accompanying multichannel marketing campaign can also sell professional services such as copywriting, coaching, book cover design, plumbing, interior design and dozens of others key services consumers are searching for.\n\nWhat if you're a plumber or contractor, or you want to offer job search coaching, resume writing or tutoring to people only in your local area? Is a website, which can reach people globally, the best idea for you? The short answer is: absolutely. People use the web to find local businesses more than they use the Yellow Pages. According to search engine marketing company Hang Ten SEO:\n\n46 percent of all searches on Google are local.\n\n18 percent of local searches lead to a sale.\n\n50 percent of consumers who performed local searches on their smartphones visited a store within one day.\n\n34 percent of consumers who performed local searches on their computer or tablet visited a store within one day.\n\n50 percent of mobile searches are looking for a business name, address, phone number or service information.\n\nThe bottom line is, it pays to have an effective website for your service business even when you serve clientele limited to your region, state or town.\n\nRelated: 10 Marketing Influencers That Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From\n\nWhether you're selling local or nationwide services, you need a website that will find and qualify prospects for you and weed out everyone else. It doesn't matter if your site is getting thousands of hits a month if none of those hits turn into likely prospects for your services. With that kind of visitors, you're getting traffic for nothing. So, let's examine the ingredients that go into an effective service-selling website.\n\nYou need a sales funnel so that when potential clients come to your site, you can take them through the service-selling process: You can generate an inquiry, qualify the prospect, fulfill the lead, follow up, give a cost estimate or proposal and close the sale.\n\nIn the service-selling funnel, you offer some free information to people who respond to your marketing. For instance, you send them an email that drives them to your website to download a free information kit on your services, a free special report or both.\n\nRelated: Marketing Your Business on Craigslist\n\nFor the people on the email list you rented who did not respond, you can keep marketing to them; each time, more will reply.\n\nFor those prospects who do respond, you fulfill their request and deliver the information they asked for. These leads are then put into a follow-up email sequence that can include emails, phone calls and other contacts. Liz Lorge of Leadpages writes, \"You need a plan that includes a follow-up sequence so your leads don't get cold. Integrate an email marketing automation tool with your landing page tool. With email automation, you can set rules that trigger entire multi-email campaigns when someone submits a landing page.\"\n\nRelated: Use These 5 Steps to Create a Marketing Plan\n\nSome prospects ask for an estimate, approve your proposal and hire you. Others don't buy your services. Put the non-buyers into an email sequence or other follow-up marketing system and contact them periodically. About five to 10 percent or more of those who did not buy your original proposal will be converted to clients over the course of this follow-up campaign.\n\nHow much should you follow up with non-responders? One approach is to continue to follow up until they tell you to stop. If you publish a monthly e-newsletter and add all your prospects to the subscriber list, they will automatically hear from you at least once a month, creating a top-of-mind awareness that turns more of these leads into clients.", "author": ["Robert W.

Used with permission from Center Street, a division of Hachette Book Group, Inc.\n\nIt's happening right in front of you every day. On network TV, broadcast radio, internet radio, podcasts, blogs and livestreams, guest experts are getting local and national exposure for their business and brands that they could never have afforded to reach with ads.\n\nRelated: 6 Rules for Acing Your First TV Appearance\n\nThe smart ones -- the rainmakers -- are amplifying every single appearance by magnitudes across a vast web of influencers to reach thousands or millions more on social media.\n\nWhat if you could get this kind of movie star visibility for your brand? How would you like to get your business or organization in front of millions of prospects?\n\nWith as little as a three-minute segment, an expert can persuade someone to vote for a candidate, shop at a local mall, move a government agency to change its policy, subscribe to a website, register for an event or show up for a march. What's more, it can flood your business with new clients. The first time I came back to my office after making an appearance as a guest expert, piles of messages form new prospects were waiting for me, and because I'd talked passionately about my brand message on the show, they were already well-qualified leads.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Turn a TV Appearance Into Evergreen PR for Your Brand\n\nYou may not realize that a lot of the experts you see in the media are just like you. Most are not paid contributors. They don't work for the network or a particular show in any capacity. They aren't so famous that the executive producer from MSNBC has them on speed dial and calls them for every show.\n\nIn today's 24/7 media, producers have to book so many guests, they have long since run through their own personal list of experts. They rely on referrals or pitches from publicists, bookers and the experts themselves to match the best expert with the news of the hour.\n\nThe beauty is, TV viewers have already opted in. You're not forcing an ad into their line of sight. They're expecting to like what you have to say. Out of all the stations they could watch, they're watching this one. With so much competition, that's more of a vote of confidence than it's ever been before. And here you are, talking to the host they listen to regularly, about issues that are closely connected to your brand.\n\nRelated: CEOs Who Appear on TV Can Get a Huge Pay Raise\n\nCan you imagine trying to get that same TV host to endorse your business or display ad? Not likely to ever happen. But, if you appear as an expert on a show, for those three to five minutes on the air, the host is asking your opinion and listening to your advice. It immediately imbues you with validation, authority and cache, as if by magic. Many entrepreneurs read books about social media marketing and analytics, they hire crews of people to manage their SEO, ROI, KPI -- or whatever metrics are most popular at the time for getting their brand in front of their target market. They spend a fortune on advertising and promotion and giveaways. It's all part of building a platform and brand in a competitive environment. But, despite all of this hard work to be seen by the right audience, they're missing the golden ring.\n\nA single appearance on the right TV show would allow them to speak directly to their audience. Not only that, but media appearances give them what would be rare or nearly impossible with ordinary promotions: an implicit endorsement by the famous host that the viewer already likes enough to watch every day or week.\n\nAs soon as a story breaks, producers immediately start looking for someone credible, engaging and available on short notice. The experts we see on the air were available and prepared to confidently jump into the conversation to add value in a way that helps move the story forward.\n\nAfter El Ni\u00f1o results in major flooding in Los Angeles, a flood risk assessment expert may come on the air to talk about the risks and best responses. When shots are fired on a vehicle in Chicago, a paramedic or a former police officer may come on to provide viewers with insight into what happens in this kind of shooting. In a crisis, producers are unable to talk to the people directly involved, so they invite related experts who can provide more general information. With stiff competition among network, cable and digital outlets, a new expert is born every day.\n\nRelated: 4 Tips to Being Your Brand's Champion on TV and YouTube\n\nBy far, most of the experts emerging today are not under contract. They are savvy businesspeople and influencers who have learned how to leverage media appearances to reach tens of thousands, or even millions, of new customers, to increase their authority and cache in their field, and to magnify their message in vitally important ways. Everyone from firefighters to sushi chefs who are experts in their fields can enter the mainstream conversation taking place on myriad media channels to voice their opinions and talk about their expertise. Although they are not paid by networks for the opportunity, they are reaping huge benefits. It could be you.\n\nMedia appearances can give you the opportunity to make your expertise available to raise the profile of your business, and to get your message out. If you inform, educate and empower people in the process, producers will be quick to invite you back. Those invitations can lead to a dramatic uptick in business or opportunities for a nonprofit.\n\nBy raising your stature and profile, you can drive more donations, enlist more involvement and maintain a much higher visibility for the causes that ignite your passion. Whether you have an expertise in a profession, like law, science or medicine, or a special interest, like consumer reports, movie reviews and cooking, there has never been a greater need for experts who are willing to step up.

However, with advancing technology and decreasing face-to-face encounters, companies are having to find new ways to get customers excited.\n\nExcitement is an emotion that fosters engagement. Positive experiences lead to increasing connections. Sports fans, for example, are so engaged they frequently describe their beloved team as part of their personality. This is the ultimate brand engagement.\n\nBy 2020, customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator. And yet, only 58 percent of executives have a formal engagement program. Companies must adopt a customer engagement strategy or get left behind. Here are 10 innovative ways business leaders can excite their customers in the ultra-connected digital age.\n\n1. Share behind-the-scenes content.\n\nTaking customers behind the scenes humanizes companies. This can be as simple as sharing employee stories on social media, or it can be a complex, immersive experience.\n\nDisney offers \u201cBehind the Scenes\u201d tours to guests to engage customers in the \u201cmagic\u201d of Disney. These tours present an unseen side of the company, demonstrating how Disney is changing the world through agriculture research or by valuing minority causes.

Launch a user conference.\n\nHarley-Davidson understands the value of bringing users together. They have long held \u201cbrandfests,\u201d which offer a place for customers to meet and create memorable experiences that build loyalty. These experiences generate emotional connections with the brand and with other users, which leads to better brand attitudes. Brandfests have been shown to increase sales by 20 percent.\n\nThe events should be an escape from normal life. They should \u201cjive\u201d with customers\u2019 lifestyles and present event goers with opportunities for personal growth.\n\nRelated: The 7 Secrets to Ensure Your User Conference Is a Smashing Success\n\n3. Survey customers to better understand them.\n\nMarketers must understand customers in order to excite them. Surveys can be useful if companies use proper analytics to interpret data and implement necessary changes. Get creative with surveys. Many customers will shy away from filling out a lengthy survey, but will be happy to answer a single question.\n\nPut a quick poll on social media or after an order, ask a couple of questions when following up with customers, or casually poll customers during checkout at a retail location. Use this data to make better decisions and help employees to better understand the target audience.\n\nRelated: 5 Steps to Creating Effective Customer Surveys\n\n4. Use personalization.\n\nEighty percent of people say that brands are not tailored to their needs. In a world where some brands like Netflix and Amazon are doubling down on personalization, smaller brands must also commit to this growing consumer trend.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Alexa \u201cgets to know the customer.\u201d The more \u201cshe\u201d learns, the easier it is for consumers to buy products. Analysts predict that in the near future, 30 percent of all searches will be made with voice searches. This disruptive change means that excitement and engagement will matter even more in the future, since ordering online through voice assistants will be about instant brand recall.\n\nRelated: The 3 Big Problems with Personalization in Online Sales and Marketing\n\n5. Package products in unique ways.\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the American Psychological Association, first impressions form in 39 milliseconds. Once an opinion is established, it tends to be held firmly, even when the person is presented with contradictory information. That\u2019s why the world\u2019s best brands focus on developing remarkable \u201cunboxing\u201d experiences.\n\nApple, for example, has a secret packaging room dedicated to creating an emotional experience when customers open the box. The experience feels so valuable that many of us save Apple boxes, though we toss out packaging for other products.\n\nBusiness leaders interested in creating a remarkable unboxing experience can use specialty services to create beautifully printed packaging. Brands including HP, Shopify and Google use outside providers to create extraordinary customer experiences from the instant the customer receives their package.\n\nRelated: 5 Creative Packaging Ideas to Delight Your Customers\n\n6. Create a purposeful brand.\n\nGeneration X and millennials want to believe companies care about the same causes they do. One study found that while 73 percent of customers want to support companies for doing something meaningful, only 5 percent think that companies actually do so.\n\nIKEA is one example of a brand that focuses on sustainability. They buy 50 percent of their wood from sustainable forests, use solar panels and control water usage in their stores. Similarly, Seventh Generation changed the cleaning products market by developing sustainable cleaning products that cater to consumer values.\n\nRelated: How These Brands Captured Millennials' Hearts in Just 9 Months\n\n7. Build a contest.\n\nContests on social media increase online audiences by as much as 34 percent and boost email sign-ups by a similar amount, according to data cited by Hubspot. While contests do not necessarily build brand loyalty in the long term, they can be an exciting way to start a relationship.\n\nRelated: 3 Steps to Generating Buzz with a YouTube Contest\n\n8. Develop a product for an underserved niche.\n\nWhen a company targets a small group of people, it is easier to build trust and loyalty. Niche products typically have very high profit margins.\n\nTesla has operated with this strategy since its inception. They are only now starting to enter the mass market with their less expensive model. Their exclusivity has created positive feelings toward the brand for many people. Tesla is the aspirational car for today\u2019s younger generations who care both about the environment and about technological innovation.\n\nRelated: 5 Quirky Businesses That Found the Perfect Niche\n\n9. Focus on creating added value.\n\nThe heart of brand loyalty is always value. Value is not about giving away free things or being the cheapest product. Instead, it is about giving customers what they want. Take Amazon Prime as one example. Consumers are willing to subscribe to Prime because of the added value they get in return.\n\nNot only are items shipped to their home faster, but they receive access to cloud storage, movies, music and world-class customer support. As a result, Amazon has been able to grow their Prime membership dramatically over the past few years.\n\n10. Try something new.\n\nAccording to a study cited by NBC, pumpkin spice in the fall has been shown to evoke positive memories of childhood. Perhaps this is one reason why Starbucks found incredible success when they launched their pumpkin spice latte in 2003. In fact, the company could barely keep up with demand in the early days.\n\nIn some instances, luck is a meaningful component of well-timed initiatives, but so is a willingness to try new things. Starbucks took a calculated risk in introducing the pumpkin spice latte, and it paid off spectacularly. Similarly, business leaders must ensure that their organizations are daring enough to try new things.\n\nThere are a variety of ways for business leaders to develop excitement and engagement in consumers. However, the common component in all 10 of the tactics mentioned in this article is putting the customer first.

Dueling pianos, those are great music venues. Dueling monologues (prolonged dueling talks by one person at a time) -- well, not so exciting.\n\nFrankly, I don't think most people (if any) are really interested if you ask them. The problem is that there are a lot of people winging it when it comes to networking. They attend an event and go straight into \"sales mode.\" They do this with someone who is also winging it which leads to the dueling monologue syndrome. This whole scenario would be pretty funny -- if it weren't actually true!!!\n\nUnfortunately, it is true. So, the question is \"How do we avoid the 'Dueling Monologue' Syndrome?\" The answer is this:\n\nDon't show off, show interest.\n\nWhat is the goal for your networking? If it is to build your business, then it's all about building a relationship with people. Keep your eye on the ball. Don't try to dazzle them with your brilliance (you can do that later). Stand out from the crowd and impress them with your genuine interest (for the record -- your interest in them -- not your interest in selling to them).\n\nI understand that this feels counter-intuitive. It is a bit of a paradox, but the truth is that the best way to start building a relationship is to show interest.\n\nRelated: 16 Tips for Becoming a Master Networker\n\nA good networker is like a good talk show host. A good host asks the guest questions and gives them time to elaborate and talk. A good networker is similar. Ask questions and let people talk. Then follow the thread of the conversation to a point where you can ask more questions. Here are some examples of questions to start with. Don't do one question after another -- do one or two of these questions and follow the thread of the conversation to ask more. Your questions should be open-ended, probing questions. These are questions that allow the respondent to open up and discuss what you've asked. Here are some examples:\n\nWhat do you like best about what you do? (If they give a short answer, ask them why or ask them to give some examples.)\n\nWhat got you started in your industry? (As they talk about this throw in additional clarification questions.)\n\nWhat's your target market? (Drill down on this. Ask more questions to be clear about who their best clients are.)\n\nGive me an example of a great client for you. (Again, drill down. See if you can get them to be specific.)\n\nWhat are some of the challenges you have in your business? (This gives you a great chance to find a way to help them, without selling to them, please!)\n\nWhere else do you network? (This is great information to know where else they go -- which gives you a chance to see them again. Ask them what they like about those networks.)\n\nRemember that this should be more like an interview, not an interrogation. Make it conversational and follow the thread of the discussion you find interesting -- or better yet, what they find interesting.\n\nDuring that process, if you hear them describe a need or a problem of some kind, and you have someone in your personal network whom you trust, make sure to let them know that you'd be happy to refer someone you know and respect who they could talk to about it. Nothing expedites a relationship faster than helping someone you've met by referring another person (or even a book or website) to help them with a challenge.\n\nRelated: 5 Creative Interview Questions to Ask Job Applicants, Approved by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Reid Hoffman\n\nDon't be like most of the people out there who think they know how to network, but who are really just doing face-to-face cold-calling.

REUTERS/ Leah Millis\n\nCatherine Jones lives on $930 a month in Social Security benefits, so every dollar counts for the retired Detroit nurse. Her income is low enough to qualify for a special Medicare program that covers Part B premium copayments and deductibles, but last April, something went wrong. For some reason, Medicare started charging her $134 each month for Part B.\n\n\u201cI called the Social Security office and told them someone was taking my money,\u201d said Jones, 67.\n\nProblems like this occur frequently, the result of paperwork snafus between interlinked Medicare, Social Security and state government systems. Jones - a widow who is in remission from a serious bout with cancer - found herself stuck in a complex bureaucratic web, and the Part B deduction continued for 10 months. Ultimately, she found her way to the Detroit Area Agency on Aging, which was able to straighten out the paperwork; Jones will be receiving a refund from Social Security of $1,340.\n\nThe agency is funded through the national network of State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP), a vital federally funded program that provides free assistance to seniors around the country as they attempt to navigate their way through Medicare\u2019s complexities. Funding for the program has been under attack - the Trump administration and House Republicans proposed to eliminate all SHIP funding for fiscal 2018, and funding levels have been cut repeatedly in recent years.\n\nBut SHIP funding is on track to survive as part of the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill under debate in Congress this week. The legislation was approved on Thursday by the U.S. House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate. It contains $49.1 million for SHIP \u2013 a $2 million increase over the fiscal 2017 level, but still below fiscal 2016, when $52.1 million was appropriated.\n\nJones\u2019 story is just one example of how SHIP helps people deal with Medicare\u2019s myriad complexities. Seniors often need help during the annual open enrollment period selecting prescription drug plans, supplemental insurance and determining if they qualify for special subsidies available to low-income enrollees.\n\nWould the state of Michigan pick up the $1.3 million in federal funding the state receives if the grants end? \u201cIt\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d said Jo Murphy, executive director of the Michigan SHIP program, citing the state\u2019s budget struggles.\n\nLast year, SHIP counselors helped more than 3 million U.S. seniors with everything from prescription drug plan selection to claims problems and special assistance programs for low-income seniors, according to the National Council on Aging (NCOA), which is battling to keep the program funded. More than one-third received help during the annual fall open-enrollment period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7.\n\nLOCAL EXPERTISE\n\nThe SHIP program is especially crucial for lower-income seniors like Jones. More than half of seniors on Medicare receive annual income of $26,200 or less, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Saving money on Medicare costs can mean the difference between medication, food or keeping the heat turned on.\n\nSays Jennifer Goldberg, directing attorney on aging for Justice in Aging, a nonprofit advocacy organization: \u201cThe SHIPs help a broad range of the senior population, but it\u2019s especially important for low-income seniors when it comes to Part D and special programs that help subsidize their expenses - that can be very confusing for people.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, for example, 42 percent of enrollees assisted by the SHIP are focused on enrollment in Extra Help, a program that often covers up to 75 percent of prescription drug costs. (reut.rs/2FY9KEC) But the program\u2019s counselors spend plenty of time helping people navigate other aspects of Medicare. This year in Michigan, enrollees must choose among 24 standard prescription drug plans and 127 Medicare Advantage plans, plus another 34 plans that cover specialized needs. And 65 medigap plans.\n\nCritics of SHIPs often argue they duplicate services available on Medicare\u2019s 800 toll-free line, or from Social Security. \u201cThey tend to think that the Medicare toll-free line and website will give beneficiaries all the information they need on plan choices,\u201d said Marci Phillips, NCOA\u2019s director of public policy and advocacy.\n\nBut those resources cannot match SHIP counselors\u2019 expertise about local health providers, or their all-important contacts with regional Social Security and Medicare staff, Goldberg said. \u201cWalking through the online Medicare plan finder tool with someone is very difficult to do by phone - it\u2019s much better to sit with a person, talk about their prescriptions and doctors and then make a recommendation.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most impressive is that all SHIP counseling is provided by well-trained volunteers. That means the federal funding is highly leveraged; NCOA reports that the program generates nearly 2 million hours of free assistance annually. In Michigan, a network of 650 volunteers is helping approximately 400,000 enrollees each year, Murphy estimates.\n\nBut they also help enrollees sort through complex claims problems and billing errors like the one faced by Jones in Detroit. She was referred to the Michigan SHIP after nearly a year making phone calls and visiting Social Security offices. The SHIP counselor knew how to sort it out by filing a special complaint tracking form to Medicare that began the process of correcting the error - the kind of thing no enrollee could reasonably be expected to do.\n\nShe says the extra $134 a month from Social Security will help, along with the expected refund. Jones worked part-time after retiring from nursing before her health worsened. Nowadays, she earns some extra income making wreaths and flower arrangements to make ends meet. \u201cAfter my insurance bills and Medicare, I didn\u2019t have any money left,\u201d she said.", "author": ["Reuters Editorial"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/n387HI-lxbs/ackman-exits-nike-stake-with-100-million-in-profit-source-idUSKBN1GY2OQ", "published": "2018-03-23T00:05:11", "title": "Ackman exits Nike stake with $100 million in profit: source", "text": "(Reuters) - Investor William Ackman has stepped out of his Nike (NKE.N) sneakers, at least in a financial sense.\n\nWilliam 'Bill' Ackman, CEO and Portfolio Manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks during the Sohn Investment Conference in New York City, U.S., May 8, 2017.

They concluded it could fly in bursts over relatively short distances like pheasants, peacocks and roadrunners.\n\nBirds evolved in the Jurassic Period from small feathered dinosaurs, and represent the only dinosaur group to have survived the mass extinction event 66 million years ago.\n\nCrow-sized Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago in a tropical archipelago that is now Bavaria, combined primitive dinosaur characteristics with traits seen in modern birds.\n\nIts fossils were first discovered in 1861 and it was long considered the earliest-known bird, though there is now a spirited scientific debate about defining the first birds.\n\n\u201cMany researchers have assumed that Archaeopteryx exhibited a very primitive way of flying that would have been equivalent to that of gliding from tree to tree, like extant flying squirrels do,\u201d said paleontologist Sophie Sanchez of Uppsala University in Sweden. \u201cIt, therefore, is a big surprise to actually recognize adaptations consistent with active flight.\u201d\n\nThe Munich specimen of the transitional dino-bird Archaeopteryx is shown in this picture taken in 2014 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France and released on March 13, 2018.

Its flight capabilities may have enabled Archaeopteryx to escape predators or fly among islands.\n\nThe researchers focused on a cross-section of the wing bones and their density of blood vessels. They found similarities to birds capable of short-distance flight, not gliding and soaring varieties like birds of prey.\n\nArchaeopteryx was likely able to take off from the ground, but must have used a unique flying style, Sanchez said. It lacked important traits in the shoulders of modern birds, making it impossible to beat its wings the way they do.\n\n\u201cWe propose that it would have been able to use its wings to propel its body in a fashion that superficially resembles the stroke of butterfly swimmers,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Communications.", "author": ["Reuters Editorial"]}]}, "sciencedaily": {"rss": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/rss/all.xml", "link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180325115835.htm", "published": "2018-03-25T16:58:35", "title": "Smaller and faster: The terahertz computer chip is now within reach", "text": "Following three years of extensive research, Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HU) physicist Dr. Uriel Levy and his team have created technology that will enable our computers -- and all optic communication devices -- to run 100 times faster through terahertz microchips.\n\nUntil now, two major challenges stood in the way of creating the terahertz microchip: overheating and scalability.\n\nHowever, in a paper published this week in Laser and Photonics Review, Dr. Levy, head of HU's Nano-Opto Group and HU emeritus professor Joseph Shappir have shown proof of concept for an optic technology that integrates the speed of optic (light) communications with the reliability -- and manufacturing scalability -- of electronics.\n\nOptic communications encompass all technologies that use light and transmit through fiber optic cables, such as the internet, email, text messages, phone calls, the cloud and data centers, among others. Optic communications are super fast but in microchips they become unreliable and difficult to replicate in large quanitites.\n\nNow, by using a Metal-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon (MONOS) structure, Levy and his team have come up with a new integrated circuit that uses flash memory technology -- the kind used in flash drives and discs-on-key -- in microchips.

It could be a bat using echolocation to expertly navigate in the dark, or an octopus quickly adapting its behavior to survive in the deep ocean. Likewise, in the computer science world, multiple forms of artificial intelligence are emerging -- different networks each trained to excel in a different task. And as will be presented today at the 25th annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS), cognitive neuroscientists increasingly are using those emerging artificial networks to enhance their understanding of one of the most elusive intelligence systems, the human brain.\n\n\"The fundamental questions cognitive neuroscientists and computer scientists seek to answer are similar,\" says Aude Oliva of MIT. \"They have a complex system made of components -- for one, it's called neurons and for the other, it's called units -- and we are doing experiments to try to determine what those components calculate.\"\n\nIn Oliva's work, which she is presenting at the CNS symposium, neuroscientists are learning much about the role of contextual clues in human image recognition. By using \"artificial neurons\" -- essentially lines of code, software -- with neural network models, they can parse out the various elements that go into recognizing a specific place or object.\n\n\"The brain is a deep and complex neural network,\" says Nikolaus Kriegeskorte of Columbia University, who is chairing the symposium. \"Neural network models are brain-inspired models that are now state-of-the-art in many artificial intelligence applications, such as computer vision.\"\n\nIn one recent study of more than 10 million images, Oliva and colleagues taught an artificial network to recognize 350 different places, such as a kitchen, bedroom, park, living room, etc. They expected the network to learn objects such as a bed associated with a bedroom. What they didn't expect was that the network would learn to recognize people and animals, for example dogs at parks and cats in living rooms.\n\nThe machine intelligence programs learn very quickly when given lots of data, which is what enables them to parse contextual learning at such a fine level, Oliva says. While it is not possible to dissect human neurons at such a level, the computer model performing a similar task is entirely transparent. The artificial neural networks serve as \"mini-brains that can be studied, changed, evaluated, compared against responses given by human neural networks, so the cognitive neuroscientists have some sort of sketch of how a real brain may function.\"\n\nIndeed, Kriegeskorte says that these models have helped neuroscientists understand how people can recognize the objects around them in the blink of an eye. \"This involves millions of signals emanating from the retina, that sweep through a sequence of layers of neurons, extracting semantic information, for example that we're looking at a street scene with several people and a dog,\" he says. \"Current neural network models can perform this kind of task using only computations that biological neurons can perform. Moreover, these neural network models can predict to some extent how a neuron deep in the brain will respond to any image.\"\n\nUsing computer science to understand the human brain is a relatively new field that is expanding rapidly thanks to advancements in computing speed and power, along with neuroscience imaging tools. The artificial networks cannot yet replicate human visual abilities, Kriegeskorte says, but by modeling the human brain, they are furthering understanding of both cognition and artificial intelligence. \"It's a uniquely exciting time to be working at the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI,\" he says.\n\nIndeed, Oliva says; \"Human cognitive and computational neuroscience is a fast-growing area of research, and knowledge about how the human brain is able to see, hear, feel, think, remember, and predict is mandatory to develop better diagnostic tools, to repair the brain, and to make sure it develops well.\"\n\n-", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180324103155.htm", "published": "2018-03-24T15:31:55", "title": "Implications of access to high-quality fruits and vegetables: Quality has potential to impact consumer selection and consumption in rural areas", "text": "Researchers at Montana State University in Bozeman have published a study showing how access to high-quality fruits and vegetables -- or lack thereof -- strongly influences whether healthy foods make it to a person's breakfast, lunch or dinner plate.\n\n\"Fruit and vegetable desirability is lower in more rural built food environments of Montana, USA using the Produce Desirability(ProDes) Tool\" was published Jan. 23 in the journal Food Security.\n\nThe researchers developed and used a food environment measure, the Produce Desirability (ProDes) Tool, to assess consumer desirability of fruits and vegetables.

The review describes how numerous, common chemicals can interfere with normal thyroid hormone actions, which are essential for normal brain development in foetuses and young children, and suggests a need for greater public health intervention.\n\nMaternal thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for normal brain development of children and previous human studies have indicated that even moderate disruption to TH function in pregnant women may affect cognitive development and increase the risk of brain developmental disorders in their children. In modern times, an increase in chemical production has led to widespread environmental chemical contamination that can affect normal hormone function in those exposed, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as children and pregnant women. Many of these identified endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which include pesticides and substances used in manufacturing a multitude of products, have been reported to interfere with thyroid hormone function, yet public health policy does not fully address the risks to vulnerable populations.\n\nIn this review, Professor Barbara Demeneix and colleagues at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sorbonne, examine published evidence of the wide variety and high number of EDCs, from pesticides to chemicals used in the manufacture of drugs, cosmetics, furniture and plastics, that can all interfere with TH. The authors further highlight that complex mixtures of these thyroid-disrupting chemicals are present in all humans, including children and pregnant women.\n\nProf Barbara Demeneix comments, \"We have reviewed the documented exposures of pregnant women and children to mixtures of thyroid-hormone-disrupting chemicals and propose that the data sets provide a plausible link to the recent increased incidence of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.\"\n\nThese findings indicate that exposures of pregnant women and children to thyroid-disrupting chemicals in the environment pose real risks for child development and health, and underline the need for a more targeted public health intervention strategy.\n\nProf Demeneix continues, \"Many experts in the field, consider that the current testing guidelines for thyroid-disrupting chemicals are not sufficiently sensitive, do not take into account recent findings and do not adequately consider risks to vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323141345.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T19:13:45", "title": "Flexible ultrasound patch could make it easier to inspect damage in odd-shaped structures", "text": "Researchers have developed a stretchable, flexible patch that could make it easier to perform ultrasound imaging on odd-shaped structures, such as engine parts, turbines, reactor pipe elbows and railroad tracks -- objects that are difficult to examine using conventional ultrasound equipment.\n\nThe ultrasound patch is a versatile and more convenient tool to inspect machine and building parts for defects and damage deep below the surface. A team of researchers led by engineers at the University of California San Diego published the study in the Mar. 23 issue of Science Advances.\n\nThe new device overcomes a limitation of today's ultrasound devices, which are difficult to use on objects that don't have perfectly flat surfaces. Conventional ultrasound probes have flat and rigid bases, which can't maintain good contact when scanning across curved, wavy, angled and other irregular surfaces. That's a considerable limitation, said Sheng Xu, a professor of nanoengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering and the study's corresponding author. \"Nonplanar surfaces are prevalent in everyday life,\" he said.\n\n\"Elbows, corners and other structural details happen to be the most critical areas in terms of failure -- they are high stress areas,\" said Francesco Lanza di Scalea, a professor of structural engineering at UC San Diego and co-author of the study. \"Conventional rigid, flat probes aren't ideal for imaging internal imperfections inside these areas.\"\n\nGel, oil or water is typically used to create better contact between the probe and the surface of the object it's examining. But too much of these substances can filter some of the signals. Conventional ultrasound probes are also bulky, making them impractical for inspecting hard-to-access parts.\n\n\"If a car engine has a crack in a hard-to-reach location, an inspector will need to take apart the entire engine and immerse the parts in water to get a full 3D image,\" Xu said.\n\nNow, a UC San Diego-led team has developed a soft ultrasound probe that can work on odd-shaped surfaces without water, gel or oil.\n\nThe probe is a thin patch of silicone elastomer patterned with what's called an \"island-bridge\" structure. This is essentially an array of small electronic parts (islands) that are each connected by spring-like structures (bridges). The islands contain electrodes and devices called piezoelectric transducers, which produce ultrasound waves when electricity passes through them. The bridges are spring-shaped copper wires that can stretch and bend, allowing the patch to conform to nonplanar surfaces without compromising its electronic functions.\n\nResearchers tested the device on an aluminum block with a wavy surface. The block contained defects two to six centimeters beneath the surface. Researchers placed the probe at various spots on the wavy surface, collected data and then reconstructed the images using a customized data processing algorithm. The probe was able to image the 2-millimeter-wide holes and cracks inside the block.\n\n\"It would be neat to be able to stick this ultrasound probe onto an engine, airplane wing or different parts of a bridge to continuously monitor for any cracks,\" said Hongjie Hu, a materials science and engineering Ph.D. student at UC San Diego and co-first author of the study.\n\nThe device is still at the proof-of-concept stage. It does not yet provide real-time imaging. It also needs to be connected to a power source and a computer to process data. \"In the future, we hope to integrate both power and a data processing function into the soft ultrasound probe to enable wireless, real-time imaging and videoing,\" Xu said.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (grant R21EB025521) and funding from Clinical and Translational Science Awards (UL1TR001442).

The putative perpetrators of the attack -- which are called CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) -- recognize specific protein fragments displayed on pancreatic islet cells and then kill them. However, even CTLs that cannot recognize islet-specific antigens (but for example viral antigen) nonetheless invade pancreata as inflammation progresses. These cells have been dubbed bystanders, since researchers didn't know what they did. Many thought they might enhance inflammation.\n\nA new study published in the March 23, 2018, issue of Science Immunology solves this mystery, with a surprising revelation. In it a team led by La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI) diabetes researcher Matthias von Herrath, M.D., reveals that bystander cell accumulation antagonizes rather than abets cell-killing by specific CTLs, curbing inflammation.\n\nThis is noteworthy because that chief anti-inflammatory role has been traditionally ascribed to what are called regulatory T cells, or \"Tregs,\" which dampen autoimmune responses. The new study challenges this notion and suggests alternate mechanisms can also be at work.\n\n\"We show that the allegedly 'professional class' of immunosuppressive Tregs is not necessarily the key player in resolving inflammation in this experimental model,\" says von Herrath, a professor in LJI's Division of Developmental Immunology. \"We now find that many cells, among them non-specific CTLs, can do that.\"\n\nTo show this, his team employed mouse models in which one can experimentally induce beta cell destruction. Simultaneously, the researchers transferred various ratios of CTLs into mice -- including both the cell-killing variety and the non-specific bystanders. They then used state-of-the-art imaging to count surviving beta cells.\n\nMice infused with low numbers of bystanders relative to specific CTLs showed beta cell destruction and diabetes symptoms, such a hyperglycemia. By contrast, mice receiving equivalent amounts of each showed little beta cell death, and the specific CTLs recruited to the pancreas became less harmful.\n\nWhy bystanders exert an immunosuppressive effect is unclear. One possibility is that their influx limits access to beta cells by the cell-killing CTLs, in effect crowding them out. Another is that bystanders interfere with signals sent to cell-killing CTLs by other cells that assist in ramping up inflammation. Whatever the reason, the result was unexpected.\n\n\"Some had thought bystanders passively add to damage done by specific CTLs but we found the opposite,\" says first author Gustaf Christoffersson, PhD, a former postdoc in the von Herrath lab. \"When bystander cells were present in sufficient amounts, they dampened those inflammatory responses.\"\n\nThat idea that Tregs are the dedicated inflammation fighters is so entrenched in the field that the group performed experiments proving that protection conferred by bystanders had nothing to do with expanding Treg populations. \"Tregs do have profound anti-inflammatory effects in some disease models,\" says Christoffersson. \"But treatments seeking to expand this cohort of cells have not proven as successful in the clinic as they have been in the lab.\"\n\nVon Herrath says his colleagues in the field must now recognize that diverse immune cell types, not just Tregs, can potentially rein in the inflammatory response in autoimmune disease. \"In the end 'professional Tregs' may matter less than we thought,\" he says. Von Herrath also relishes how his new paper upends dogma in the field. \"Right now people are talking about challenges to science,\" he says. \"But the biggest threat to science comes when we hold onto ideas too closely. Then we might miss the obvious.\"\n\nIn fact, his team is already planning ways to widen the therapeutic focus. \"We are currently looking into whether there are ways to safely induce a bystander population of T cells to work in our favor as treatment for type 1 diabetes,\" says Christoffersson, now a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nThe study was funded in part by the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, the Swedish Research Council and the National Institutes of Health.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323141339.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T19:13:39", "title": "High-sensitivity 3-D technique using single-atom measurements", "text": "Researchers at Griffith University working with Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have unveiled a stunningly accurate technique for scientific measurements which uses a single atom as the sensor, with sensitivity down to 100 zeptoNewtons.\n\nUsing highly miniaturised segmented-style Fresnel lenses -- the same design used in lighthouses for more than a century -- which enable exceptionally high-quality images of a single atom, the scientists have been able to detect position displacements with nanometre precision in three dimensions.\n\n\"Our atom is missing one electron, so it's very sensitive to electrical fields.

This year's maximum extent was 448,000 square miles (1.16 million square kilometers) -- an area larger than Texas and California combined -- below the 1981 to 2010 average maximum extent.\n\nEvery year, the sea ice cover blanketing the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas thickens and expands during the fall and winter, reaching its maximum yearly extent sometime between late February and early April. The ice then thins and shrinks during the spring and summer until it reaches its annual minimum extent in September. Arctic sea ice has been declining both during the growing and melting seasons in recent decades.\n\nThe decline of the Arctic sea ice cover has myriad effects, from changes in climate and weather patterns to impacts on the plants and animals dependent on the ice, and to the indigenous human communities that rely on them. The disappearing ice is also altering shipping routes, increasing coastal erosion and affecting ocean circulation.\n\n\"The Arctic sea ice cover continues to be in a decreasing trend and this is connected to the ongoing warming of the Arctic,\" said Claire Parkinson, senior climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"It's a two-way street: the warming means less ice is going to form and more ice is going to melt, but also, because there's less ice, less of the sun's incident solar radiation is reflected off, and this contributes to the warming.\"\n\nThe Arctic has gone through repeated warm episodes this winter, with temperatures climbing more than 40 degrees above average in some regions. The North Pole even experienced temperatures above the freezing point for a few days in February.\n\nIn mid-March, cooler temperatures and winds pushed out the edge of the sea ice pack and caused a late surge in ice growth that brought the maximum extent closer in line with the past few years.\n\nIn February, a large area of open water appeared in the sea ice cover north of Greenland, within the multiyear ice pack -- the Arctic's oldest and thickest ice. Most of the opening has refrozen but the new ice is expected to be thinner and more fragile, and a new opening might appear during the melt season. This could make the ice in this region more mobile and prone to exiting the Arctic this summer through either the Fram or Nares straits, ultimately melting in the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"This old, thicker ice is what we expect to provide stability to the Arctic sea ice system, since we expect that ice not to be as vulnerable to melting out as thinner, younger ice,\" said Alek Petty, a sea ice researcher at Goddard. \"As ice in the Arctic becomes thinner and more mobile, it increases the likelihood for rapid ice loss in the summer.\"\n\nDespite the fact that this year's melt season will begin with a low winter sea ice extent, this doesn't necessarily mean that we will see another record low summertime extent.\n\n\"A lot will depend on what the wind and temperature conditions will be in the spring and summer,\" Parkinson said.\n\nStarting March 22, Operation IceBridge, NASA's aerial survey of polar ice, is flying over the Arctic Ocean to map the distribution and thickness of sea ice. In the fall, NASA will launch a new satellite mission, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which will continuously monitor how sea ice thickness is changing across the Arctic.\n\nFor NSIDC's analysis: http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2018/03/arctic-sea-ice-maximum-second-lowest/", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323132804.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T18:28:04", "title": "Making monitors brighter: Controlling the color of OLEDs", "text": "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are used in smartphones and televisions to facilitate the high-contrast display of colours. Conjugated polymers are also often employed as organic semiconductors in such diodes. Researchers at the University of Bayreuth have found out how the spatial structure of these polymers can be used to control the colours of the OLEDs and help to increase the brightness of monitors. They have now presented this previously unknown mechanism in the scientific journal PNAS.\n\nPolymers with a backbone: spatial structures determine the colour of light\n\nPolymers that are well-suited for use in organic light-emitting diodes play a central role in the new research findings. Thanks to the chain formed by connecting molecular building blocks, they possess a backbone. If the polymers are then exposed to a laser beam, they absorb the light and store it as excitation energy. This energy spreads along the backbone. Shortly after that, it is released by emission of light.\n\nUp to now it had been assumed that the colour of the emitted light depends on how far the excitation energy spreads along the polymers: supposedly, the more bent the polymers were, the smaller the distance over which the energy spread. However, the scientists in Bayreuth have now refuted this assumption. The polymers they studied have backbones that are chemically identical and bent to different degrees, but the excitation energy always spreads over the same distance. Bent polymers emit green or blue light, while elongated polymers radiate yellow or red light. \"When these polymers come to be used in organic light-emitting diodes, their various spatial structures can be utilized to precisely control the colour of the light emit from the OLEDs,\" explained physicist Dominic Raithel (M.Sc.), lead author of the article that has now been published in PNAS.\n\nThe researchers in Bayreuth also found out that the elongated polymers possess a scaffold formed by its side chains, which stabilizes the elongated structure. \"This results in a special advantage for light-emitting diodes: when elongated polymers are layered on top of one another, the scaffolds provide stability. Optical emission is not thereby weakened,\" said Raithel, who recently completed his dissertation in the University of Bayreuth's DFG-funded research training group \"Photophysics of Synthetic and Biological Multichromophoric Systems.\" In this context, natural and synthetic organic materials are studied in close interdisciplinary cooperation.

Recombinant protein production, for example, has transformed the lives of millions of people through the synthesis of biopharmaceuticals, like insulin, and industrial enzymes, like those used in laundry detergents. Conventionally, protein production has been accomplished in living cells in large centralized manufacturing facilities.\n\n\"Alternatively, what cell-free protein synthesis does is take the cell, rip off the cell wall, and collect the guts of the cell. We then use this to make a protein without a living, intact organism,\" said Jewett, who is also co-director of Northwestern's Center of Synthetic Biology. \"You can imagine I've taken a car and opened the hood and taken out the engine and put it over here in my driveway. Now I can use it to do something else.\"\n\nWithout the worry of trying to keep a cell alive, this process opens up many possibilities, including the synthesis of new classes of enzymes, therapeutics, materials, and chemicals with diverse chemistry. A living cell may balk when asked to do something it hasn't seen in its evolutionary biology, not so for a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) platform.\n\nThe problem up to this point, though, has been that efforts to use CFPS systems for expanding multiple non-canonical amino acids have been limited by competition with the natural machinery that terminates protein synthesis. As a result, manufacturing proteins harboring diverse chemistries with high purity and yields has presented a formidable challenge.\n\nBut Jewett and the team produced the highest yields of proteins with non-canonical amino acids ever reported for in vitro systems, suggesting that long-term commercial applications for CFPS might be realistic.\n\nJewett credited the breakthrough to two elements. The first was the idea of using a genomically recoded organism of Escherichia coli bacteria that lacked release factor 1.\n\n\"This is important because it provided us an open coding channel to incorporate new chemistry,\" he said. \"Trying to develop a cell-free protein synthesis from that strain had never been done before.\"\n\nThe second element came courtesy of Jewett's student, Rey Martin, the lead author of the paper.\n\nJewett said when they first tried to use the strain, they failed to make enough protein.\n\n\"What my student Rey did in a very innovative strategy was find genes in the chromosome of that organism that we thought were negatively affecting our ability to produce protein,\" Jewett said. \"He functionally inactivated them to enable higher cell-free protein synthesis yields.\"\n\nJewett said that Martin didn't stop there.\n\n\"Rey optimized the cell-free environment to enable multiple identical non-canonical amino acids to be incorporated,\" Jewett said. Where before researchers have used just one or a few instances, he said his team was able to incorporate up to 40, site specifically with no observable truncation products.\n\n\"What that means is we can really change fundamentally the properties of protein polymers in unique and new ways,\" Jewett said. \"And you may ask, 'well, what are you going do with that?' From a research perspective, we haven't had this exact capability before so we haven't been able to even ask the question.\"\n\nJewett imagines applications not just with medicines but also biomaterials for drug delivery systems, medical materials such as surgical sutures, and functionalized biopolymers.\n\n\"What's special about this platform is that it's already being used in so many other project areas in the lab,\" Jewett said. \"It has the potential to open up an entirely new area of materials chemistry research for biotechnology and, more broadly, could enable new paradigms of on-demand biomanufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323130844.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T18:08:44", "title": "Significant role for nitrate in the Arctic landscape", "text": "Nitrogen, an essential plant nutrient, is most readily absorbed by plants in its ammonium and nitrate forms. Because of the very low nitrate levels found in arctic tundra soil, scientists had assumed that plants in this biome do not use nitrate. But a new study co-authored by four Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) Ecosystems Center scientists challenges this notion. The study has important implications for predicting which arctic plant species will dominate as the climate warms, as well as how much carbon tundra ecosystems can store.\n\nThe study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that plants in northern Alaska's tussock tundra took up nitrate at comparable rates to vegetation in nitrate-rich ecosystems. Nitrate contributed about one-third of the nitrogen the tundra plants used. Some of the species studied, such as Polygonum bistorta, a pink flowering plant, took up nitrate at even higher rates than species found in low-latitude, high-nitrate environments.\n\nThe findings are important in the context of human-caused climate change, which is expected to increase nitrogen, and potentially nitrate, levels in tundra soil. As the climate warms, the microbial processes that generate nitrate could speed up. In addition, permafrost -- a layer of soil below the surface that remains frozen throughout the year -- could thaw, adding additional nitrogen to the ecosystem. Some of this nitrogen could be converted to nitrate.\n\nThe tussock tundra covers a large part of northern Alaska and is currently composed of sedges, herbaceous ground cover, and woody shrubs (about a third coverage for each). The landscape's productivity is limited by nitrogen availability. If released from this limitation, woody shrub species, such as birch and willow, could become more dominant and shade out other plants as the climate warms. The discovery that nitrate is an important nitrogen source for tundra plants will need to be factored into future projections of species composition.\n\n\"As the nutrients start cycling faster and the vegetation starts growing faster, that should stimulate all the vegetation on the tundra. After a while, the woody species should be able to overtop the ones that don't have stems, that can't stand up that high. So you tend to lose the sedges and the mosses and the lichens,\" explained study co-author Ed Rastetter, a senior scientist at the MBL Ecosystems Center and principal investigator for the National Science Foundation's Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research site at Toolik Lake, Alaska, where part of the research was conducted.\n\nBecause nitrogen and carbon cycles are tightly coupled, the team's discovery might also alter projections of carbon storage or release from arctic ecosystems as the climate warms. The world's permafrost is packed with the remnants of plants and animals accumulated over thousands of years, and it contains twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere.\n\nRastetter stresses that more research is needed to confirm the study's findings and to better understand the importance of nitrate relative to other forms of nitrogen in arctic tundra ecosystems.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323130841.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T18:08:41", "title": "Law of particle dynamics of granular gases: Increasing temps in cooling systems", "text": "For the very first time, scientists from Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), the University of Leicester and the University of Vigo have proven that the kinetic energy from particles in granular gases such as dust clouds can rise temporarily even though energy is constantly being drawn out of the system. Their research adds further detail to Haff's law (devised 35 years ago), which states that the granular temperature in closed systems continually decreases. The results were gained using new simulation processes and have now been published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nGranular gases are systems that contain macroscopic particles in low density. Examples include cosmic dust, the rings around the planets Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and also clouds of dust on Earth. They can essentially be described like molecular gases such as helium, but with one important difference -- granular particles do not collide elastically. 'In isolated granular gases without external energy input, the kinetic energy of the particles constantly decreases due to the collisions, which is why the granular temperature also decreases', explains Prof. Dr. Thorsten P\u00f6schel from the Chair for Multiscale Simulation of Particulate Systems at FAU. 'This cooling law, also known as Haff's law, has been known since 1983 and it is one of the key findings of the kinetics of granular gases'.\n\nAdhesion changes properties\n\nHowever, Haff's law of granular cooling does not consider one aspect. Various forces such as surface adhesion or electrostatic charge cause the particles to adhere to each other in systems with extremely small particles measuring only a few micrometres. 'The particles grow and their properties change due to this aggregation. At the same time, they decrease in number in the system and thus the number of degrees of freedom for particle movement also decreases', explains Dr. Thorsen P\u00f6schel. 'Our hypothesis was that the granular temperature can increase temporarily because of this, even though mechanical energy is lost with every collision.'\n\nNew simulation methods look at old law in more detail\n\nP\u00f6schel and his colleagues physicist Nikolai V. Brilliantov from the University of Leicester (UK) and computer scientist Arno Formella from the University of Vigo (Spain) were able to prove the existence of this counterintuitive effect in complex simulations. To do so, the researchers used and developed established methods such as analytical mathematics for the kinetics of gas properties and the Monte Carlo method -- a stochastic method based on the theory of probability. P\u00f6schel explains: 'By using a new system of kinetic equations and the relevant scaling methods, we were able to depict the dynamics of particle aggregations in granular gases reliably for the first time. We have not revised Haff's law by any means, but we were able to demonstrate an important effect that had been disregarded up to now.'\n\nThe scientists' findings could help to increase the understanding of the basic properties of granular gases such as soot agglomeration in flue gases on Earth or in astrophysical phenomena such as cosmic dust in planetary rings in space.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323130835.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T18:08:35", "title": "First proof a synthesized antibiotic is capable of treating superbugs", "text": "A \"game changing\" new antibiotic which is capable of killing superbugs has been successfully synthesised and used to treat an infection for the first time -- and could lead to the first new class of antibiotic drug in 30 years.\n\nThe breakthrough is another major step forward on the journey to develop a commercially viable drug version based on teixobactin -- a natural antibiotic discovered by US scientists in soil samples in 2015 which has been heralded as a \"gamechanger\" in the battle against antibiotic resistant pathogens such as MRSA and VRE.\n\nScientists from the University of Lincoln, UK, have now successfully created a simplified, synthesised form of teixobactin which has been used to treat a bacterial infection in mice, demonstrating the first proof that such simplified versions of its real form could be used to treat real bacterial infection as the basis of a new drug.\n\nThe team at Lincoln developed a library of synthetic versions of teixobactin by replacing key amino acids at specific points in the antibiotic's structure to make it easier to recreate. After these simplified synthetic versions were shown to be highly potent against superbug-causing bacteria in vitro -- or test tube -- experiments, researchers from the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) then used one of the synthetic versions to successfully treat a bacterial infection in mice.\n\nAs well as clearing the infection, the synthesised teixobactin also minimised the infection's severity, which was not the case for the clinically-used antibiotic, moxifloxacin, used as a control study. The findings are published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.\n\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.\n\nDr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, said: \"Translating our success with these simplified synthetic versions from test tubes to real cases is a quantum jump in the development of new antibiotics, and brings us closer to realising the therapeutic potential of simplified teixobactins.\n\n\"When teixobactin was discovered it was groundbreaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA, but natural teixobactin was not created for human use.\n\n\"A significant amount of work remains in the development of teixobactin as a therapeutic antibiotic for human use -- we are probably around six to ten years off a drug that doctors can prescribe to patients -- but this is a real step in the right direction and now opens the door for improving our in vivo analogues.\"\n\nDr Lakshminarayanan Rajamani from SERI added: \"We need sophisticated armour to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Drugs that target the fundamental mechanism of bacterial survival, and also reduce the host's inflammatory responses are the need of the hour. Our preliminary studies suggest that the modified peptide decreases the bacterial burden as well as disease severity, thus potentially enhancing the therapeutic utility.\"\n\nThe work builds on the success of the Lincoln team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 22 months to turn teixobactin into a viable drug.

At the median follow-up time of 8.4 years, there was no difference in overall survival. The 8-year overall survival for patients who received the escalated dose of radiotherapy was 76% and the 8-year overall survival for the standard radiotherapy dose was 75%.

For example, researchers have learned that older adults with slower walking speeds seem to have a greater risk of dementia than those with faster walking speeds. Recently, researchers from the United Kingdom teamed up to learn more about changes in walking speed, changes in the ability to think and make decisions, and dementia. They published their study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.\n\nThe researchers examined information collected from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging.

Then, they compared the people who had developed dementia with those who had not.\n\nResearchers discovered that of the nearly 4,000 older adults they studied, those with a slower walking speed had a greater risk of developing dementia. And people who experienced a faster decline in walking speed over a two-year period were also at higher risk for dementia.

According to a recent study conducted at the University of Helsinki, common factors among young women and men who succeeded in managing their weight in the long term included eating regularly rather than dieting.\n\n\"Often, people try to prevent and manage excess weight and obesity by dieting and skipping meals. In the long term, such approaches seem to actually accelerate getting fatter, rather than prevent it,\" says Ulla K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen, a researcher and licensed nutritional therapist at the University of Helsinki.\n\nThe study on weight management conducted at the University of Helsinki was part of the extensive FinnTwin 16 study, with more than 4,900 young men and women as participants. The study subjects answered surveys mapping out factors impacting weight and weight change when they were 24 years of age, and again ten years later at the age of 34.\n\nMost subjects gained weight during the decade in between. Only 7.5% of women and 3.8% of men lost weight over the period. Between the ages of 24 and 34, the mean gain in women was 0.9 kg per year, while in men the corresponding gain was 1.0 kg.\n\nIn addition to dieting and irregular eating habits, women's risk of gaining weight was increased by giving birth to two or more children, regular consumption of sweetened beverages and poor contentment with life. In men, the additional factor increasing the risk of gaining weight was smoking. Factors protecting from weight gain were physical activity in women, while in men they were a higher level of education and greater weight at the beginning of the study period.\n\nFOCUS ON PRIMARY WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, NOT ON DIETING\n\nIn our current environment, succeeding in long-term weight management is particularly challenging. The scientific knowledge gained so far on successful weight management is primarily based on studies where the subjects first lost weight and then started managing it.\n\n\"To effectively prevent weight gain, understanding the factors underlying weight management that precedes the gain, or primary weight management, is of utmost importance,\" notes K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen.\n\nExercise and healthy eating habits are considered the cornerstones of weight management. However, according to this long-term population study, even more essential to successful weight management is refraining from dieting and observing regular eating habits, in both women and men.\n\nThe factors underlying successful weight management seem to change between the short and long term. These factors are also partly gender-specific.\n\n\"Generally speaking, weight management guidance often boils down to eating less and exercising more. In practice, people are encouraged to lose weight, whereas the results of our extensive population study indicate that losing weight is not an effective weight management method in the long run,\" says K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen.\n\n\"Prior research has shown that approximately every other adult is constantly dieting. According to the National Institute for Health and Welfare, nearly a million Finns diet every year. Even though dieting may seem a logical solution to weight management problems, it can actually increase weight gain and eating problems in the long run.\"\n\nThe research findings prove that instead of losing weight, it is more important to focus on eating regular meals, taking care of one's wellbeing and finding a more general sense of meaning in life. Regular and sufficient meals support the natural biological functions of the body, and help in managing one's eating habits and weight management in the long term.\n\n\"Our findings demonstrate that weight management would benefit from an increased focus on individual differences, as well as perceiving the factors that impact human wellbeing and the sense of meaning in life as a broader whole,\" K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen sums up.\n\nThe study has been published in the international Eating Behaviors journal.

At the OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics meeting, held 3-6 April in Hollywood, Florida, USA, researchers from Milan, Italy, will report an advance in instrument development that increases the sensitivity of OM by as much as 1000-fold.\n\nIn 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, more than 1.7 million women worldwide were diagnosed with breast cancer. Many of these diagnoses are made using X-ray mammography. Although standard and widely used, X-ray imaging for breast cancer suffers from both low sensitivity (50-75%) and the use of ionizing radiation that cannot be considered completely safe.\n\nThe newly-developed instrument replaces two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of existing instruments with an eight-channel probe involving silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and a multichannel time-to-digital converter. These changes eliminate a time-wasting pre-scan step that was required to avoid damage to the PMTs. In addition to increased sensitivity, the new instrument is both more robust and cheaper.\n\nWhile X-ray mammography is widely used and is still the recommended method for routine screenings, its use is limited by the patient's age, weight or body mass index, whether or not hormone replacement therapy is being used, and other issues. In addition, its accuracy -- particularly when used in younger women -- has been called into question. Other imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasound, are sometimes suggested, but neither is an effective replacement for X-ray mammography.\n\nOptical imaging methods, on the other hand, have attracted increasing interest for breast cancer diagnosis since both visible and infrared light are highly sensitive to blood volume and oxygenation. Tumors are characterized by a high volume of blood due to the increased vascularization that occurs as tumors grow. OM can be used to measure blood volume, oxygenation, lipid, water and collagen content for a suspicious area identified through standard X-ray imaging. Collagen measurements are particularly important since this species is known to be involved in the onset and progression of breast cancer.\n\nOne major disadvantage to OM imaging is the poor spatial resolution that has been achieved to date. Breast cancer tumors larger than 1 centimeter are very dangerous and more likely to lead to death, so a successful screening technique must be able to resolve smaller lesions. This remains a problem with OM imaging as a stand-alone technique, but combining OM with other imaging methods shows some promise.\n\nA possible advantage to OM, however, is that only gentle pressure need be applied to the breast tissue, in stark contrast to the standard technique for X-ray imaging. In fact, breast compression tends to reduce blood volume in the tissue, which would interfere with the OM image, so some three-dimensional OM detectors being developed use no compression at all but, rather, surround the breast tissue with rings of light sources and detectors.\n\nWhile poor spatial resolution of OM methods remains a challenge, the method does show promise for use in pre-surgical chemotherapy. As Edoardo Ferocino, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, co-author of the work explains, \"This technique is able to provide information on the outcome of chemotherapy just weeks after beginning treatment, or possibly even sooner.\" Ferocino's group is planning clinical studies to explore the use of OM to monitor and predict the outcome of chemotherapy.\n\nThe investigators in Milan are working with a larger consortium on a project known as SOLUS, \"Smart Optical and Ultrasound Diagnostics of Breast Cancer.\" This project is funded by the European Union through the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program and aims to combine optical imaging methods with ultrasound to improve specificity in the diagnosis of breast cancer.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104841.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:41", "title": "Mysterious head of a pharaoh discovered by Swansea Egyptologist", "text": "Swansea University Egyptology lecturer Dr Ken Griffin has found a depiction of one of the most famous pharaoh's in history Hatshepsut (one of only a handful of female pharaohs) on an object in the Egypt Centre stores, which had been chosen for an object handling session.\n\nThe opportunity to handle genuine Egyptian artefacts is provided by the Egypt Centre to students studying Egyptology at Swansea University. During a recent handling session for an Egyptian Art and Architecture module Dr Kenneth Griffin, from the University's Department of Classics, Ancient History and Egyptology, noticed that one of the objects chosen was much more interesting than initially thought.\n\nConsisting of two irregularly shaped limestone fragments that have been glued together, the object had been kept in storage for over twenty years and was requested for the handling session based only on an old black and white photograph.\n\nThe front side depicts the head of a figure whose face is unfortunately missing, with the remains of a fan directly behind. Traces of hieroglyphs are also present above the head. The iconography of the piece indicates that it represents a ruler of Egypt, particularly with the presence of the uraeus (cobra) on the forehead of the figure. Who is this mysterious pharaoh and where did the fragment originate from?\n\nA search of the Egypt Centre records provides no information on the original provenance or find spot of the object. What is known is that it came to Swansea in 1971 as part of the distribution of objects belonging to Sir Henry Wellcome (1853-1936), the pharmaceutical entrepreneur based in London. The fragments are less than 5cm thick and had clearly been removed from the wall of a temple or tomb, as can be seen from the cut marks on the back.\n\nHaving visited Egypt on over fifty occasions, Dr Griffin quickly recognised the iconography as being similar to reliefs within the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri (Luxor), which was constructed during the height of the New Kingdom. In particular, the treatment of the hair, the fillet headband with twisted uraeus, and the decoration of the fan are all well-known at Deir el-Bahri.\n\nMost importantly, the hieroglyphs above the head -- part of a formulaic text attested elsewhere at the temple -- use a feminine pronoun, a clear indication that the figure is female.\n\nHatshepsut was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1478-1458 BC) and one of only a handful of women to have held this position. Early in her reign she was represented as a female wearing a long dress, but she gradually took on more masculine traits, including being depicted with a beard. The reign of Hatshepsut was one of peace and prosperity, which allowed her to construct monuments throughout Egypt. Her memorial temple at Deir el-Bahri, built to celebrate and maintain her cult, is a masterpiece of Egyptian architecture.\n\nMany fragments were taken from this site during the late nineteenth century, before the temple was excavated by the Egypt Exploration Fund (now Egypt Exploration Society) between 1902-1909. Since 1961 the Polish Archaeological Mission to Egypt has been excavating, restoring, and recording the temple.\n\nYet the mystery of the precious find doesn't end there. On the rear of the upper fragment, the head of a man with a short beard is depicted. Initially there was no explanation for this, but it is now clear that the upper fragment had been removed and recarved in more recent times in order to complete the face of the lower fragment. The replacement of the fragment below the figure would also explain the unusual cut of the upper fragment. This was probably done by an antiques dealer, auctioneer, or even the previous owner of the piece in order to increase its value and attractiveness. It was eventually decided at an unknown date to glue the fragments together in the original layout, which is how they now appear.\n\nWhile Deir el-Bahri seems the most likely provenance for this artefact, further research is needed in order to confirm this and it may even be possible to one day determine the exact spot the fragments originated from.\n\nGiven the importance of the object, the head of Hatshepsut has now been placed on display in a prominent position within the House of Life at the Egypt Centre so that the relief can be appreciated by visitors to the Centre.\n\nDr Griffin said: \"The Egypt Centre is a wonderful resource and is certainly one of the major factors in attracting students to study Egyptology at Swansea University.\"\n\n\"The identification of the object as depicting Hatshepsut caused great excitement amongst the students. After all, it was only through conducting handling sessions for them that this discovery came to light.\"\n\n\"While most of the students have never visited Egypt before, the handling sessions help to bring Egypt to them.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104839.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:39", "title": "Jaguars and well-managed logging concessions can coexist, say conservationists: Conservationists from San Diego Zoo Global and Bronx Zoo-based WCS examined impacts of logging concessions in Guatemala ", "text": "Logging activities in biodiverse forests can have a huge negative impact on wildlife, particularly large species such as big cats, but a new study proves that the Western Hemisphere's largest cat species -- the jaguar (Panthera onca) -- can do well in logging concessions that are properly managed, according to conservationists from the San Diego Zoo Global and the Bronx Zoo-based WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society).\n\nThe study titled \"Do responsibly managed logging concessions adequately protect jaguars and other large and medium-sized mammals? Two case studies from Guatemala and Peru\" appears in the online version of the journal Biological Conservation. The authors are: Mathias W. Tobler and Samia E. Carrillo-Percastegui of San Diego Zoo Global; Rony Garcia Anleu, Gabriela Ponce Santizo, John Polisar, and Isaac Goldstein of WCS; and Alfonso Zu\u00f1iga Hartley of San Diego Zoo Global and Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre, Lima, Peru.\n\n\"Our findings indicate that certified logging operations can play an important role in maintaining vital habitat for jaguars and other large wildlife species,\" said Tobler, a scientist for San Diego Zoo Global and lead author of the study.\n\nMuch of the world's tropical forests have disappeared as a result of deforestation, particularly in biodiverse regions such as Central and South America that are home to jaguars, tapirs, peccaries, and many other charismatic species. Reduced impact logging operations, which strive to prevent uncontrolled hunting and other negative environmental impacts, provide conservationists with a sustainable alternative in multiple-use and/or buffer areas near core zones or fully protected areas.\n\nTo that end, the study research team initiated large-scale camera trap surveys to gauge the effectiveness of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified logging concessions in both Guatemala and Peru in maintaining terrestrial mammal communities, with a focus on jaguars. The camera traps in Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve captured a total of 23 individual jaguars, whereas the traps in two concessions in Peru's Madre de Dios region recorded 43 of these big cats. The appearance of the same jaguar in two or more images can be determined from spot patterns that are unique to each individual; such \"recaptures\" are important for accurately determining jaguar densities.\n\nThe spatial capture-recapture models used to calculate jaguar densities in both certified logging concession locations estimated that the Guatemala site contained an average of 1.5 jaguars per 100 square kilometers, whereas the Peru site contained an average of 4.5 jaguars. Further, both sites supported more than 20 large and medium mammal species (with 22 in Guatemala and 27 in Peru).\n\nAdditionally, the scientists found that strictly controlled logging roads with limited access in well-managed concessions were used by several species, including carnivores, as movement corridors, a finding contrary to the conventional thinking of the roads being negative disturbances to wildlife. Authors caution that logging roads must still be closed to the public so that traffic levels can be kept low to ensure that impacts to wildlife are minimized.\n\n\"Controlling access into an area and hunting of prey are paramount considerations for the objectives of preserving biodiversity and ecological function, both of which are selling points for certified lumber products,\" said Dr. John Polisar, coordinator for WCS's Jaguar Program and a co-author of the study. \"The presence of jaguars in a logging concession is testimony that environmental guidelines are being followed.\"\n\nPolisar was the lead author in a previously published paper (in the journal Ambio) titled \"Using certified timber extraction to benefit jaguar and ecosystem conservation.\" The study focused exclusively on jaguars (as opposed to jaguars and other large and medium sized species in the aforementioned paper) and explored the factors that contributed to the persistence of these big cats in certified forests in Bolivia, French Guiana, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n\nStudies assessing the environmental impacts of logging operations are crucial for saving wildlife, say study authors and other conservationists, who add that certified, low-impact timber management by community groups and industrial operators constitutes one of the most effective jaguar conservation strategies available to jaguar-range countries. Properly managed concessions help forests persist in the face of more intensive land uses, generate income for local stakeholders who become lead defenders of the forests, and maintain habitat for jaguars and their prey as they range beyond fully protected areas.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104836.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:36", "title": "Which piece resembles your color perception for #theDress image?", "text": "A novel algorithm to simulate the color appearance of objects under chromatic illuminants has been proposed by Ichiro Kuriki of Tohoku University. The figure shows the result of applying this algorithm to #theDress image.\n\n\"#theDress image\" refers to a photo that went viral on the Internet in February 2015, when viewers disagreed over the colors seen in the dress. The discussion revealed differences in human color perception and prompted studies in vision science.\n\nHow do we perceive colors? The details are not yet fully understood even for colors that we easily experience as we open our eyes. This is still one of the fundamental questions about our vision. Objects reflect light from an illuminant on their surfaces. The reflected light yields visual images after entering the eye. The light that falls on the retina changes with an illuminant. However, we scarcely perceive object color shifts. Although slight color shifts remain, the human visual system is able to compensate for illuminant changes.\n\nSeveral groups have proposed algorithms to simulate the shifts in color appearance, but problems remain. One problem concerns achromatic points. Achromatic points are a series of rays that appear colorless (white to black through gray) under a given illuminant, and they work as the origin to evaluate hue and vividness. Therefore, an achromatic point is a keystone in the color appearance simulations, but previous models by other groups proposed complicated formulas to simulate the achromatic points.\n\nKuriki previously discovered a simple method to approximate these achromatic points under a chromatic illuminant. By combining this with a lightness adjustment, a simple algorithm was proposed to simulate the color appearance under a colored illuminant. The algorithm was applied to #theDress image, widely acknowledged for huge individual differences in color appearance.\n\nSuch variability is known to originate from differences in the estimated color and intensity of the illuminant falling on the dress. For example, if a viewer assumed a bluish dim illuminant, the white/gold would be perceived. The color and intensity of illuminant was systematically varied and successfully simulated differences in color appearance of #theDress under various assumptions; one of these pieces may resemble what you perceive from #theDress image.\n\nThe method is also capable of preserving the wider color range of the image at a darker part, even when adjusted for the lightness to simulate a dimmer situation.

In nearly three out of four patients the cancer causes metastasis, leaving the original site of the tumor and spreading to distant sites in the body. Metastatic prostate cancer cells often travel to bone, where they can affect bone structure and cause severe pain, pathological fractures, and spinal cord compression. A better understanding of the process that enables these cancer cells to remodel bone may aid in the search for new therapies. In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) report the discovery of an RNA molecule that may play a key role in bone restructuring caused by prostate cancer.\n\nProper bone development is maintained through a fine balance of bone-forming (osteoblast) and bone-resorbing (osteoclast) cells. Tumor cells metastasized to bone modify the activity of these cells and, depending on the type of cancer, cause osteoblastic or osteolytic changes.\n\n\"Metastatic tumor cells can promote either bone formation or bone resorption,\" lead author Kyoko Hashimoto explains. \"Osteoblastic lesions are bone-forming sites that are commonly found in prostate cancer. These lesions cause structural weakness in the bone and, even worse, promote additional tumor growth. If we can figure out how prostate cancer cells alter the environment inside bone to induce this osteoblastic process, we can start to identify new therapeutic targets.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, the researchers looked for differences between bone-forming prostate cancer cells and bone-resorbing breast cancer cells. They focused on microRNAs -- short RNA molecules that regulate the expression of a variety of genes. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs are delivered from cells to cells via exosomes to serve as intercellular communication tools. MicroRNAs secreted by cancer cells can alter the expression of genes in non-cancerous cells, disrupting their normal function and promoting tumor growth.\n\nThe team looked at a panel of microRNAs and compared their abundance in exosomes derived from prostate cancer and breast cancer. One microRNA in particular, miR-940, was highly abundant in the prostate cancer-derived exosomes and turned out to play a powerful role in promoting bone formation.\n\n\"We found that miR-940 can be secreted from metastatic cancer cells and alter gene expression in cells that reside in bone, causing them to take on osteoblast-like properties,\" Hashimoto adds. \"When implanted into the tibia or onto the skull of mice, moreover, we discovered that cells expressing miR-940 can induce the kind of osteoblastic lesions that are typical of prostate cancer.\"\n\nStrikingly, when miR-940 was expressed in bone-resorbing breast cancer cells, the cells triggered bone-forming lesions in mice -- behaving as though they were prostate cancer cells. Their findings suggest that miR-940 plays a central role in the bone-forming ability of prostate cancer.\n\n\"Our study suggests that microRNAs are an important factor that modify bone remodeling and promote tumor growth in metastatic prostate cancer,\" lead investigator Shingo Sato concludes. \"Once cancer has metastasized to bone it is usually incurable, so any insight into the process of metastasis is immensely helpful in the search for novel therapies. We're hopeful that our findings will eventually open a new pathway for therapeutic targets in this form of cancer.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104829.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:29", "title": "Breakthrough antimalarial drug delivery system using mesoporous silica nanoparticles", "text": "Drug delivery systems (DDSs) control when and how much drugs are delivered to the body. Numerous DDS studies have been conducted but most have focused on treatments for cancer. New research from Kumamoto University uses a DDS to treat malaria.\n\nThe existing treatment for malaria is taken orally and has three main problems: (1) most antimalarial drugs are broken down in the stomach, (2) the drugs have strong side effects, and (3) the medicine stays in the body for only a short time. These issues resulted in malaria treatments that were not particularly effective.\n\nMCM-41 is a porous silica material with a pore size of 2-30 nm. It can incorporate drugs into its pores, which makes it a useful material for DDS applications. A research group headed by Prof. Shinya Hayami from Kumamoto University, Japan believed that MCM-41 could be used as DDS for antimalarial drugs. To test their theory, they created a new DDS by combining the antimalarial drugs Artesunate and Quinine with MCT-41 and performed in vitro and in vivo experiments. They found:\n\n(1) The release time of the antimalarial medicine became very long, one week or longer, which was an improvement from the standard medication time. (2) Compared to ingesting Artesunate or Quinine, the new DDS increased treatment efficiency by 20 and 240 times respectively in animal experiments. (As defined in this study, the therapeutic efficiency is 50% of the effective dose (ED50), and is used as an index of drug strength. The smaller the value of ED50, the greater the action of the drug. In other words, if an effect is obtained with a small amount of a drug, the treatment efficiency is high.) (3) MCM-41 itself is non-toxic and inactive. A DDS using MCM-41 is expected to have very weak side effects.\n\n\"Using this DDS for antimalarial drugs has introduced a new possibility for highly efficient malaria treatment for the first time,\" said Professor Shinya Hayami. \"We expect that it will be put to practical use in areas where malaria treatment is still necessary. Now, we are planning to develop clinical trials for antimalarial drugs as well as new DDSs for other drugs, like anti-HIV medications.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104824.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:24", "title": "Germany was covered by glaciers 450,000 years ago: New chronological data for the Middle Pleistocene glacial cycles push back the first glaciation and early human appearance in central Germany by abou", "text": "The timing of the Middle Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles and the feedback mechanisms between climatic shifts and earth-surface processes are still poorly understood.

The Pleistocene river gravel deposits from the top of the sequence in the former brown-coal mine Zwenkau, which is located south of Leipzig in Saxony, yielded the oldest Middle Paleolithic artefacts. This artefact inventory, the stone tool assemblage of \"Eythra,\" is known for its numerous handaxes and dates back to about 280,000 years ago.\n\nThe youngest sediments from which the researchers obtained the new dates belong to the so-called Saalian glaciation (named after the river Saale).

So says Friedbert Weiss, leader of an investigative team at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, in Neuropsychopharmacology published by Springer Nature.\n\nStaying drug-free is a constant battle for abstinent addicts. This struggle is made more difficult when former-addicts find themselves in drug-related settings, experience stress or higher levels of anxiousness. Many struggle to control their impulses when offered an addictive drug like alcohol or cocaine.\n\nWeiss and his research associate Gustavo Gonzalez-Cuevas set out to test the effect of Cannabidiol (CBD) on drug relapse in a rat model. CBD is the major non-psychoactive ingredient of Cannabis sativa, a plant that is used to make marijuana. CBD has been considered for some time as a possible treatment for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, and more recently also for the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nThe researchers applied a gel containing CBD once per day for a week to the skin of the rats in the current study. These animals had a history of voluntary daily alcohol or cocaine self-administration, leading to addiction-like behaviour. Various tests were performed to see how they reacted to stressful and anxiety-provoking situations and behavior in tests of impulsivity, a psychological trait associated with drug addiction. The researchers reported that CBD effectively reduced relapse provoked by stress and drug cues; CBD also reduced anxiety and impulsivity in the drug-experienced rats.\n\nFurther studies showed that CBD was completely cleared from the brain and plasma of the rats three days after the therapy was completed. Quite unexpectedly though, five months later, experimental animals that had been treated with CBD still showed a reduced relapse induced by stress or drug cues. The authors of the study believe that insight into the mechanisms by which CBD exerts these effects in future research may open new vistas for the pharmacotherapeutic prevention of relapse to drug use.\n\n\"The efficacy of the cannabinoid [CBD] to reduce reinstatement in rats with both alcohol and cocaine -- and, as previously reported, heroin -- histories predicts therapeutic potential for addiction treatment across several classes of abused drugs,\" says Weiss. \"The results provide proof of principle supporting the potential of CBD in relapse prevention along two dimensions: beneficial actions across several vulnerability states, and long-lasting effects with only brief treatment.\" He goes on to say that \"Drug addicts enter relapse vulnerability states for multiple reasons. Therefore, effects such as these observed with CBD that concurrently ameliorate several of these are likely to be more effective in preventing relapse than treatments targeting only a single state.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104819.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:19", "title": "Growing and surviving: How proteins regulate the cell cycle", "text": "Cell division is the basis of all life. Even the smallest errors in this complex process can lead to grave diseases like cancer. Certain proteins have to be switched on or off at certain times for everything to go according to plan. Biophysicists and medical biochemists at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) have managed to describe the underlying mechanism of this process. They have figured out how different signaling pathways in the cell change the structure of proteins, thereby driving the cell division cycle in the right direction at the right time. The researchers present their findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe cell cycle is an extremely complex and precisely defined process. \"The parent cell has to double its existing components and then divide into to daughter cells. In order to do this, numerous genes have to be switched on and off at very specific times,\" says biophysicist Professor Jochen Balbach from MLU. The cell cycle is sub-divided into various phases. These are controlled by what are known as inhibitors proteins, also called CDK inhibitors. Like a red traffic light, these proteins block transition to the next phase until the cell gives the relevant start signal. The signal to start the next phase of the cell cycle comes from a special enzyme group, the kinases. \"Previously we only knew that the kinases passed on the signal by adding a phosphate group onto the CDK inhibitors. There was no knowledge, however, of which kinases do this and the underlying molecular mechanism for this,\" continues Balbach.\n\nTogether with the working group led by Professor Mechthild Hatzfeld from the Pathobiochemistry Section of the Medical Faculty of MLU, the researchers have now been able to describe this signaling pathway for the first time. They combined high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopy data with methods from cell biology. This meant that the researchers were able to explain the mechanism first in test tubes and then directly in cells. The researchers found that the kinases change the structure of the inhibitor proteins by unfolding them. This process disables the original function of the inhibitor proteins and releases a further blocked kinase that gives the signal for the cell cycle to continue. This local unfolding also triggers the degradation of the inhibitor in the cell, determining the direction in which the progression occurs. The researchers from Halle assume that this mechanism preserved by evolution is the basis of many cellular signal pathways.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323104816.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T15:48:16", "title": "How a genetic mutation can interfere with the powerhouses of cells", "text": "Dr. Nora V\u00f6gtle, head of an Emmy Noether junior research group at the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine of the University of Freiburg, together with her team and in cooperation with paediatricians from Europe, Australia and the USA, has identified the molecular consequences of a previously undefined genetic mutation. This mutation interferes with the functioning of the mitochondria, known as the powerhouses of cells. It usually occurs following what would normally be a harmless infection in early childhood, leading to a severe disease and subsequently to the brain no longer being able to maintain control of key bodily functions, including motor functions. The researchers have published their study in the American Journal of Human Genetics.\n\nMitochondria are organelles that occur in higher cells and perform a variety of functions. They are best known for converting the energy stored in food into energy which can be used for cellular biochemical reactions. However they are also responsible for the production of many metabolic products and cofactors that are needed for the functioning of many enzymes. So, if something goes wrong with them, diseases can occur. Defective mitochondria lead above all to diseases of tissues and organs that demand high levels of energy. Therefore they often affect the nervous system, the heart or the skeletal muscles.\n\nGenetic analysis of the genome of affected patients and their families from three different continents showed that a specific gene was always changed by an inherited mutation. This gene supplies the blueprint for a protein that is needed in the mitochondria. Here, this protein removes signal attachments, known as presequences, which are needed to import most of the mitochondrial proteins from the cell fluid. Therefore, it is termed as Mitochondrial Presequence Protease (MPP).\n\nIn her work at the interface of fundamental research and medicine, V\u00f6gtle and her team showed that the genetic change in the MPP gene leads to a protein with impaired functioning. It is no longer able to cleave the presequences efficiently, resulting in accumulation of immature proteins in the mitochondria. This can lead to interference with many mitochondrial functions. For parts of her study, V\u00f6gtle used baker's yeast as a model organism. In the yeast MPP, which is related to the human gene, her team introduced the same disease-causing mutations and studied the resulting consequences on the work processes in the mitochondria.\n\n\"Sadly we have not yet been able to save any of the sick children with our findings,\" says V\u00f6gtle, adding, \"However without this fundamental explanation of pathological mechanisms no therapeutic approaches could be developed.

The physicists published their findings in the scientific journal Nature Communications.\n\nPhotovoltaic solar panels convert sunlight into electrical power. The panels absorb the incoming light which excites electrons sending them off in a predefined direction in order to generate an electric current that can drive motors or light a bulb. This works through the interaction of several layers of semiconductors and metals in the solar panel. The cells are manufactured in a complex process where several chemical elements are deposited on a glass substrate, typically by evaporation. Thereby, a solar cell \"grows,\" layer by layer.\n\nIn the past, scientists discovered by accident that the efficiency of one type of solar cell technology improves vastly if they add sodium to the light absorbing layer. At the same time, they observed that the sodium impacts the growth of this layer and the interaction of the other chemical elements, namely it inhibits the mixing of gallium and indium. This leads to less homogenous layers and thus impairs the results. Therefore, in the past, scientists and manufacturers believed that the ideal way to produce a solar cell was to only add the sodium after the growth process was concluded.\n\nBy using a different approach, researchers from the Physics and Materials Science Research Unit at the University of Luxembourg, along with four internationals partners, now were able to show that the truth is more nuanced. While conventionally the light-absorbing layer is made up of thousands of individual grains, the research group chose a more demanding fabrication strategy and grew the layer as a single grain. \"Essentially, in this work we show that if the absorber is made of only one grain, adding a small amount of sodium helps to homogenize the distribution of the elements,\" said Diego Colombara, now Marie Curie Research Fellow at the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory and the principal investigator of the study. \"This is very surprising, because more than 20 years of previous research have consistently shown the opposite effect on absorbers made of many grains.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the researchers is that sodium has a dual effect: it homogenises the elements inside each grain but it slows down homogenisation in the interplay between grains. \"This gives us the opportunity to rethink how we produce solar cells. In the future, these insights might lead to improvements in the manufacturing process,\" concluded Dr Phillip Dale, the head of the research group at the Laboratory for Energy Materials (LEM) at the University of Luxembourg and an Attract fellow of the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323093739.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T14:37:39", "title": "Dental oral craniofacial tissue regeneration consortia", "text": "The ability to robustly and predictably regenerate dental, oral and craniofacial (DOC) tissues through tissue engineering and/or regenerative medicine strategies is a major goal for clinicians.

These results open up new avenues for understanding the control of S. aureus virulence mechanisms. This work was recently published in the journal PLoS Pathogens.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus is part of the natural skin flora, preferentially colonizing external mucosa in 30 to 50% of the population, healthy carriers who develop no symptoms. But it is also a major human pathogen, causing diseases ranging from skin lesions (boils, impetigo, etc.) to endocarditis, acute pneumonia, osteomyelitis or sepsis. It is the leading Gram-positive bacterium responsible for nosocomial infections (hospital acquired infections). The most dangerous strains are those that display resistance to multiple antibiotics. This is the case of MRSA[1], resistant to Meticillin, widespread in hospitals and posing a major public health concern.\n\nThe Signaling and Pathogenesis of Staphylococci team, led by Tarek Msadek, a researcher in the Biology of Gram-positive Pathogens Unit at the Institut Pasteur (CNRS ERL 3526), is studying bacterial responses to environmental variations and their role in Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis and host interactions. These responses are often genetically controlled by so-called \"two-component\" systems. During the study of one of these systems, WalKR, essential for bacterial survival, they characterized an additional component, SpdC, a membrane protein whose role was unknown. This component interacts with the WalKR system to control its activity and its absence leads to a strong decrease in virulence, biofilm formation (bacterial aggregates), and resistance to certain antibiotics.\n\nThese results suggest that inhibition of SpdC could be used as an approach to combat S. aureus infections and understand the mechanisms involved in its transition from commensal to pathogen.\n\n[1] Meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323093734.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T14:37:34", "title": "Biodiversity and nature's contributions continue dangerous decline, scientists warn: Human well-being at risk. Landmark reports highlight options to protect and restore nature and its vital contributi", "text": "Biodiversity -- the essential variety of life forms on Earth -- continues to decline in every region of the world, significantly reducing nature's capacity to contribute to people's well-being. This alarming trend endangers economies, livelihoods, food security and the quality of life of people everywhere, according to four landmark science reports released today, written by more than 550 leading experts, from over 100 countries.\n\nThe result of three years of work, the four regional assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services cover the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, as well as Europe and Central Asia -- the entire planet except the poles and the open oceans. The assessment reports were approved by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, at the 6th session of its Plenary. IPBES has 129 State Members.\n\n\"Biodiversity and nature's contributions to people sound, to many people, academic and far removed from our daily lives,\" said the Chair of IPBES, Sir Robert Watson, \"Nothing could be further from the truth -- they are the bedrock of our food, clean water and energy. They are at the heart not only of our survival, but of our cultures, identities and enjoyment of life. The best available evidence, gathered by the world's leading experts, points us now to a single conclusion: we must act to halt and reverse the unsustainable use of nature -- or risk not only the future we want, but even the lives we currently lead. Fortunately, the evidence also shows that we know how to protect and partially restore our vital natural assets.\"\n\nThe extensively peer-reviewed IPBES assessment reports focus on providing answers to key questions for each of the four regions, including: why is biodiversity important, where are we making progress, what are the main threats and opportunities for biodiversity and how can we adjust our policies and institutions for a more sustainable future?\n\nIn every region, with the exception of a number of positive examples where lessons can be learned, biodiversity and nature's capacity to contribute to people are being degraded, reduced and lost due to a number of common pressures -- habitat stress; overexploitation and unsustainable use of natural resources; air, land and water pollution; increasing numbers and impact of invasive alien species and climate change, among others.\n\nDeclining Biodiversity -- Now and in the Future\n\nThe Americas\n\n\"In the Americas, rich biodiversity makes an immense contribution to the quality of life, helping to reduce poverty while strengthening economies and livelihoods,\" said Dr. Jake Rice (Canada), co-chair of the Americas assessment with Dr. Cristiana Sim\u00e3o Seixas (Brazil) and Prof. Maria Elena Zaccagnini (Argentina).\n\n\"The economic value of the Americas' land-based nature's contributions to people is estimated to be more than US$24 trillion per year -- equivalent to the region's GDP, yet almost two-thirds -- 65% -- of these contributions are in decline, with 21% declining strongly. Human-induced climate change, which affects temperature, precipitation and the nature of extreme events, is increasingly driving biodiversity loss and the reduction of nature's contributions to people, worsening the impact of habitat degradation, pollution, invasive species and the overexploitation of natural resources.\"\n\nAccording to the report, under a 'business as usual' scenario, climate change will be the fastest growing driver negatively impacting biodiversity by 2050 in the Americas, becoming comparable to the pressures imposed by land use change. On average today, the populations of species in an area are about 31% smaller than was the case at the time of European settlement. With the growing effects of climate change added to the other drivers, this loss is projected to reach 40% by 2050.\n\nThe report highlights the fact that indigenous people and local communities have created a diversity of polyculture and agroforestry systems, which have increased biodiversity and shaped landscapes. However, the decoupling of lifestyles from the local environment has eroded, for many, their sense of place, language and indigenous local knowledge. More than 60% of the languages in the Americas, and the cultures associated with them, are troubled or dying out.\n\nAfrica\n\n\"Africa's immense natural resources and its diverse cultural heritage are among its most important strategic assets for both human development and well-being,\" said Dr. Emma Archer (South Africa), co-chair of the African assessment with Dr. Kalemani Jo Mulongoy (DRC) and Dr. Luthando Dziba (South Africa). \"Africa is the last place on Earth with a wide range of large mammals, yet today there are more African plants, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and large mammals threatened than ever before by a range of both human-induced and natural causes.\"\n\n\"Africa is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and this is going to have severe consequences for economically marginalized populations. By 2100, climate change could also result in the loss of more than half of African bird and mammal species, a 20-30% decline in the productivity of Africa's lakes and significant loss of African plant species.\"\n\nThe report adds that approximately 500,000 square kilometres of African land is already estimated to have been degraded by overexploitation of natural resources, erosion, salinization and pollution, resulting in significant loss of nature's contributions to people. Even greater pressure will be placed on the continent's biodiversity as the current African population of 1.25 billion people is set to double to 2.5 billion by 2050.\n\nMarine and coastal environments make significant economic, social and cultural contributions to the people of Africa. Damage to coral reef systems, mostly due to pollution and climate change, has far-reaching implications for fisheries, food security, tourism and overall marine biodiversity.\n\nAsia-Pacific\n\n\"Biodiversity and ecosystem services contributed to rapid average annual economic growth of 7.6% from 1990 to 2010 in the Asia-Pacific region, benefitting its more than 4.5 billion people. This growth, in turn, has had varying impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services,\" said Dr. Madhav Karki (Nepal), co-chair of the Asia-Pacific assessment with Dr. Sonali Senaratna Sellamuttu (Sri Lanka). \"The region's biodiversity faces unprecedented threats, from extreme weather events and sea level rise, to invasive alien species, agricultural intensification and increasing waste and pollution.\"\n\nThe report says that although there has been an overall decline in biodiversity, there have also been some important biodiversity successes including, for example, increases in protected areas. Over the past 25 years, marine protected areas in the region increased by almost 14% and terrestrial protected area increased by 0.3%. Forest cover increased by 2.5%, with the highest increases in North East Asia (22.9%) and by South Asia (5.8%).\n\nThere are concerns, however, that these efforts are insufficient to halt the loss of biodiversity and the decline in the value of nature's contributions to people in the region. Unsustainable aquaculture practices, overfishing and destructive harvesting threaten coastal and marine ecosystems, with projections that, if current fishing practices continue, there will be no exploitable fish stocks in the region by 2048. Intertidal zones are also rapidly deteriorating due to human activities, with coral reefs of critical ecological, cultural and economic importance, already under serious threat, and some reefs having already been lost, especially in South and South-East Asia. According to the report, up to 90% of corals will suffer severe degradation by 2050, even under conservative climate change scenarios.\n\nThe report emphasizes that climate change and associated extreme events pose great threats, especially to coastal ecosystems, low-lying coastal areas and islands. Climate change is also impacting species distributions, population sizes, and the timing of reproduction and migration. Increased frequencies of pest and disease outbreaks resulting from these changes may have additional negative effects on agricultural production and human well-being, with impacts projected to worsen.\n\nForests, alpine ecosystems, inland freshwater and wetlands, as well as coastal systems are identified as the most threatened Asia-Pacific ecosystems. The increasing variety and abundance of invasive alien species is highlighted as one of the region's most serious drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss.\n\nEurope and Central Asia\n\nA major trend is the increasing intensity of conventional agriculture and forestry, which leads to biodiversity decline. There are also examples of sustainable agricultural and forestry practices that are beneficial to biodiversity and nature's contributions to people in the region. Nature's material contributions to people, such as food and energy, have been promoted at the expense of both regulating contributions, such as pollination and soil formation, and non-material contributions, such as cultural experiences or opportunities to develop a sense of place.\n\n\"The people of the region consume more renewable natural resources than the region produces,\" said Prof. Markus Fischer (Switzerland), co-chair of the Europe and Central Asia assessment with Prof. Mark Rounsevell (UK), \"Although this is somewhat off-set by higher biocapacities in Eastern Europe and northern parts of Western and Central Europe.\"\n\nIn the European Union, among assessments of the conservation status of species and habitat types of conservation interest, only 7% of marine species and 9% of marine habitat types show a 'favourable conservation status'. Moreover 27% of species assessments and 66% of habitat types assessments show an 'unfavourable conservation status', with the others categorised as 'unknown'.\n\nThe authors find that further economic growth can facilitate sustainable development only if it is decoupled from the degradation of biodiversity and nature's capacity to contribute to people. Such decoupling, however, has not yet happened, and would require far-reaching change in policies and tax reforms at the global and national levels.\n\nAbandonment of traditional land-use systems, and loss of associated indigenous and local knowledge and practices, has been widespread in Europe and Central Asia, the report finds. Production-based subsidies driving growth in agricultural, forestry and natural resource extraction sectors tend to exacerbate conflicting land-use issues, often impinging on available territory for traditional users. Maintenance of traditional land use and lifestyles in Europe and Central Asia is strongly related to institutional adequacy and economic viability.\n\nGlobal Development Goals in Jeopardy\n\n\"One of the most important findings across the four IPBES regional assessments is that failure to prioritize policies and actions to stop and reverse biodiversity loss, and the continued degradation of nature's contributions to people, seriously jeopardises the chances of any region, and almost every country, meeting their global development targets,\" said Dr. Anne Larigauderie, the Executive Secretary of IPBES.\n\n\"Achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and the Paris Agreement on climate change, all depend on the health and vitality of our natural environment in all its diversity and complexity. Acting to protect and promote biodiversity is at least as important to achieving these commitments and to human wellbeing as is the fight against global climate change.\"\n\n\"Richer, more diverse ecosystems are better able to cope with disturbances -- such as extreme events and the emergence of diseases. They are our 'insurance policy' against unforeseen disasters and, used sustainably, they also offer many of the best solutions to our most pressing challenges.\"\n\nThe assessment of the Americas concludes that continued biodiversity loss could undermine the achievement of some of the SDGs as well as some of the international climate-related goals, targets and aspirations.\n\nAll the plausible future scenarios explored in the Africa assessment highlight that the drivers of biodiversity loss will increase, with associated negative impacts on nature's contributions to people and human well-being. Achieving the African Union's Agenda 2063, the SDGs and the Aichi Targets is unlikely in three out of five scenarios explored.\n\nThe experts of the Asia-Pacific assessment point to the value of ecosystem based approaches and identify, among others, lack of solid waste management, as well as air, water and land pollution as factors undermining gains in a number of the Aichi Targets and SDGs for many countries (e.g. extinction of plant and animal species due to deforestation, rising temperature and water pollution).\n\nThere has been some progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in Europe and Central Asia, e.g. in terms of the area under protection or in mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society. However, the pressures on biodiversity from direct drivers of change are unlikely to be reduced and so progress has been negative for indigenous and local knowledge, the equitable distribution of nature's contributions and water security.\n\nLooking beyond the 2030 timescale of the SDGs, scenario analysis highlights that continuation of past and current trends in drivers of change will inhibit the contribution of the region to the widespread achievement of the SDGs, while scenarios which focus on achieving a balanced supply of nature's contributions to people and incorporate a diversity of values are more likely to contribute to achieving the majority of the SDGs.\n\nPromising Policy Options Available\n\nAccompanying the stark concerns of the IPBES experts, however, are messages of hope: promising policy options do exist and have been found to work in protecting and restoring biodiversity and nature's contributions to people, where they have been effectively applied.\n\nIn the Americas, protection of key biodiversity areas increased 17% between 1970 and 2010, yet fewer than 20% of key biodiversity areas are protected and coverage varies significantly. The report makes it clear that protected areas and restoration projects are only some of the possible interventions -- with a need to also focus on strategies to make human-dominated landscapes more supportive of biodiversity and nature's contributions to people.\n\nIt also makes the point that biodiversity and nature's contributions to people are better protected when integrated into a broad array of economic and sectoral policies, such as payment for ecosystem services and voluntary eco-certification. Appropriate combinations of, for example, behavioural change, improved technology, research, adequate levels of finance, improved education and public awareness programs are among other options.\n\nMeasures taken by African Governments to protect biodiversity and nature's contributions to people, have contributed to some recovery of threatened species, especially in key biodiversity areas, and these efforts could be enhanced. Such measures include the establishment and effective management of protected areas and networks of wildlife corridors; restoration of degraded ecosystems; control of invasive alien species and reintroduction of wild animals. Despite the African Union's priorities of poverty alleviation, inclusive growth and sustainable development, especially in the context of global climate change, the report finds that the continent is greatly undervaluing its natural resources.\n\nIn addition to enhancing biodiversity conservation through appropriate governance, policies and national implementation, the authors emphasize the need for better integration of indigenous and local knowledge and greater use of scenarios in African decision-making. Of the five possible scenarios they explore, two (regional sustainability and local sustainability) are identified as the most likely paths to meet Africa's economic, social and environmental development aspirations, but the authors point to the need for capacity building on the use of scenarios in decision-making.\n\nFor Asia and the Pacific, the IPBES experts point to the success of countries that achieved rapid economic growth in gradually restoring and expanding protected areas -- especially forests. They emphasize that, while assisting these countries in their efforts to meet some of the SDGs and Aichi Targets, this alone will not be sufficient to reduce biodiversity loss caused by the negative impacts of monoculture. For instance, the region registered a growth of 0.3% in terrestrial protected areas and 13.8% in marine protected areas -- putting many countries on track to meet Aichi Target 11 -- but most of the important bird areas and key biodiversity areas remain unprotected.\"\n\nBetter application of science and technology, empowerment of local communities in decision making, integrating biodiversity conservation into other key sectors, scenario planning that is sensitive to economic and cultural diversity, private sector partnerships in financing biodiversity protection, as well as better cross-border regional collaboration, are some of the many important approaches the report identifies.\n\nA range of governance options, policies and management practices is available in Europe and Central Asia to safeguard biodiversity and ensure nature's contributions to people. Some progress has already been made in mainstreaming biodiversity and nature's contributions to people into public and private decision-making.\n\nThe assessment report highlights integrated approaches. These include measuring national welfare beyond GDP. Governance could become more effective by using well-designed mixes of policy instruments to motivate changes in behaviour to support sustainable development. The authors also emphasize the relevance of reconciling biodiversity conservation and human rights standards through rights-based instruments, as well as capacity building for indigenous peoples and local communities. Sufficient funding is also needed to support research, monitoring, education and training.\n\nSpeaking about the policy options emerging from the four regional assessments, Watson said: \"Although there are no 'silver bullets' or 'one-size-fits all' answers, the best options in all four regional assessments are found in better governance, integrating biodiversity concerns into sectoral policies and practices (e.g. agriculture and energy), the application of scientific knowledge and technology, increased awareness and behavioural changes.\"\n\n\"It is also clear that indigenous and local knowledge can be an invaluable asset, and biodiversity issues need to receive much higher priority in policy making and development planning at every level. Cross-border collaboration is also essential, given that biodiversity challenges recognize no national boundaries.\"\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe Americas\n\nTrends / data\n\n13%: the Americas' share of

"Mutations of the bassoon gene causing new brain disorder", "text": "Newly discovered gene mutations may help explain the cause of a disease that drastically impairs walking and thinking.\n\nMutations have been found in the bassoon (BSN) gene, which is involved with the central nervous system, in patients with symptoms similar to, but different from, a rare brain disorder called progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n\nPSP, a form of Parkinson's disease, is often difficult to diagnose because it can affect people in different ways. Serious problems often include difficulty with walking and balance in addition to a decline in cognitive abilities such as frontal lobe dysfunction.\n\nA team of Japanese researchers investigated patients whose symptoms resembled not only PSP but also Alzheimer's disease. Despite similarities in the symptoms, detailed pathological analyses showed no resemblance to either disease, which prompted the team to further research the new disease's underlying mechanism.\n\nThey first analyzed the genomes of a Japanese family with several members displaying PSP-like symptoms. They identified a mutation in the BSN gene only in family members with symptoms. These individuals did not have mutations in the 52 other genes associated with PSP and other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This was the first time BSN gene is associated with a neurological disorder.\n\nThe researchers also detected three other mutations in the BSN gene in four out of 41 other patients displaying sporadic, or non-familial, PSP-like symptoms. None of the BSN mutations were detected in a random sample of 100 healthy individuals, underscoring the strong involvement of BSN mutations in the disease.\n\nAn autopsy done on one of the family members with the BSN mutation showed an accumulation of a protein called tau in the brain, which is not seen in a normal brain. The researchers believe that the BSN mutation is involved in the tau accumulation, which could cause the development of PSP-like symptoms. An experiment introducing a mutated rat BSN gene to cultured cells also suggested that the mutation causes the accumulation of tau. Communication between nerve fibres could also be affected, as BSN protein play a role in it.\n\n\"This is a peculiar neurodegenerative disorder which involves mutations in the BSN gene and tau accumulation, but differs from any known disease, including dementia, Parkinson's, and even PSP,\" says Associate Professor Ichiro Yabe of Hokkaido University who led the study. \"Patients with PSP-like symptoms and other neurodegenerative disorders should be analyzed for BSN mutations to fine-tune their diagnoses.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323091054.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T14:10:54", "title": "New study elucidates link between PCOS and anxiety", "text": "Maternal obesity and androgen excess induce sex-specific anxiety in the offspring, according to a study on mice by researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden published in The FASEB Journal. The findings may help explain why children born to mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased risk of developing anxiety later in life.\n\nPCOS affects more than one in ten women of childbearing age and is characterised by high levels of male hormones in the blood, menstrual disorders, insulin resistance and obesity. The syndrome is also associated with a significantly increased risk of mental illness such as anxiety and depression. The reasons behind PCOS have not been clarified, but environmental factors during fetal life, such as maternal obesity or exposure to male hormones (androgens) via the mother's blood, are thought to be important risk factors.\n\n\"The fact that daughters of women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing the condition and that sons often develop obesity and insulin resistance, indicates that the fetal environment plays a crucial role,\" says Professor Elisabet Stener-Victorin at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Physiology and Pharmacology who led the study.\n\nThe researchers investigated 16 groups of female and male mice offspring exposed to maternal diet-induced obesity and male hormone excess and studied how these environmental factors affected the mice's behaviour as well as gene expression in the brain. After birth, half of the mice were exposed to high-fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced obesity to also investigate the effect of diet in the offspring.\n\nThe study revealed sex-specific, anxiety-like behaviour in the offspring of both normal-weight and obese pregnant mice exposed to the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Independent of the mothers' other diet components, female offspring exposed to maternal androgens in utero developed an anxiety-like behaviour. A HFHS diet after birth did not significantly affect the female mice's behaviour. Male offspring, on the other hand, were unaffected by the elevated maternal androgen levels, but displayed anxiety-like behaviour in response to maternal obesity.\n\nThe environmental factors also affected gene expression in the brain. A number of genes implicated in anxiety were dysregulated in the amygdala and hypothalamus in the brain in a sex-specific manner.\n\n\"The novelty of our study is the multifactorial approach, which made it possible to show that females are more sensitive to androgen exposure during fetal life while males are more sensitive to diet-induced obesity.

It is accepted in medical research that, in breast cancer for example, tumour cells first of all enter the vascular system and then colonise the sentinel lymph nodes closest to the primary tumour. From there they travel along the lymph channels via further secondary lymph nodes and eventually find their way into the bloodstream. In a mouse model, PhD student Markus Brown from MedUni Vienna's Department of Pathology has now discovered another highly efficient and much faster route via which tumour cells already in the sentinel lymph nodes pass through their blood vessels to \"invade\" the vascular system, causing pulmonary metastases. The study has recently been published in the journal Science.\n\nLymph nodes have an important filter function within the immune system and are arranged \"in series\" along lymphatic vessels. As a rule, malignant tumour cells first of all migrate into lymph vessels and the associated lymph nodes, where they form metastatic colonies. The sentinel lymph node is the lymph node closest to the primary tumour.\n\nIn the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer, for example, the exact size and number of tumour colonies in the lymph nodes close to the tumour site are an important prognostic factor for the development of metastases in the lung, brain or bones, for example. However, in order to reach these organs, the tumour cells must first of all pass from the lymphatic system into the vascular system. In order to design a targeted therapeutic blockade, it is necessary to understand the precise molecular processes involved in this transition. However, up until now, the corresponding underlying principles were not available.\n\nAs part of his PhD within the working group of the former head of MedUni Vienna's Department of Pathology and professor emeritus, Dontscho Kerjaschki, and working closely with Michael Sixt's laboratory at ISTA (Institute of Science and Technology Austria) in Klosterneuburg, Markus Brown (currently working at Genentec in San Francisco) infused fluorescent marker cells from a breast tumour directly into the lymph vessels of mice and monitored how they spread into the adjoining lymph node. He observed that, within a period of 48 hours, the infused tumour cells produced the molecular signs of increased aggression, migrated out of the solid tumour and found their way into special blood vessels in the lymph node. Even after such a short time, tumour cells are already circulating in the vascular system and forming pulmonary metastases.\n\nThe initial results of this basic pathogenesis research suggest that it is likely that such an entry point for tumour cells to invade the vascular system is also present in humans.

Tobacco smoke caused around 32,200 cases of cancer in men (17.7% of all male cancer cases) and around 22,000 (12.4%) in women in 2015, according to the research published in the British Journal of Cancer.\n\nExcess weight is the second biggest preventable cause of cancer. Around 22,800 (6.3%) cases of cancer a year are down to being overweight or obese. This amounts to around 13,200 (7.5%) cases of cancer in women and around 9,600 (5.2%) in men.\n\nObesity causes 13 types of cancer, including bowel, breast, womb and kidney. And the results suggest that more than 1 in 20 cancer cases could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nThe third biggest preventable cause of cancer is overexposure to UV radiation from the sun and sunbeds, which causes around 13,600 cases of melanoma skin cancer a year (3.8% of all cancer cases).\n\nOther preventable causes of cancer include drinking alcohol, eating too little fibre (causing around 11,900 and around 11,700 cases respectively, which is 3.3% each) and outdoor air pollution. While air pollution is to blame for around 3,600 lung cancer cases a year (1% of all cancer cases), it still causes far fewer cases of lung cancer than tobacco.\n\nSir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive, said: \"Leading a healthy life doesn't guarantee that a person won't get cancer, but it can stack the odds in your favour. These figures show that we each can take positive steps to help reduce our individual risk of the disease.\n\n\"This research clearly demonstrates the impact of smoking and obesity on cancer risk. Prevention is the most cost-effective way of beating cancer and the UK Government could do much more to help people by making a healthy choice the easy choice.\"\n\nProfessor Linda Bauld, Cancer Research UK's prevention expert, said: \"These new figures show that the battle to conquer smoking-related cancer is far from over. But the declining numbers of smokers show that prevention strategies are working.\n\n\"Obesity is a huge health threat right now, and it will only get worse if nothing is done. The UK Government must build on the successes of smoking prevention to reduce the number of weight-related cancers.

During surgery to remove two fibroids from her womb, cancer was found. Janet then had a full hysterectomy to remove her womb and cervix. Because the cancer was caught in the earliest stages and hadn't spread, she avoided any further treatment.\n\nVolunteering to take part in some womb cancer research after her treatment, Janet was shocked to find out that the possible contributing factors for womb cancer included being obese and being inactive.\n\nJanet said: \"That was me.

This is demonstrated by Yahya Jani in a new dissertation in environmental science from Linnaeus University.\n\nEnvironmental pollution, health threats and scarcity of raw materials, water, food and energy are some of the greatest challenges our world is facing today. At the same time, landfills and open dumpsites are still the dominant global waste disposal options, despite the fact that the long-term environmental impact in the form of emissions of greenhouse gases and contaminated leachates is significant. However, much of the environmentally hazardous waste that has been dumped at landfills can be recycled as energy or reused as valuable raw materials in different industries according to Yahya Jani, doctor of environmental science and chemical engineering.\n\nLandfill mining -- the tool of the future\n\nIn his dissertation, landfill mining is suggested as a tool to achieve an enhanced circular economy model. Viewing the landfill waste as a potential resource instead of as a problem is a common thread in Yahya's research.\n\n\"More than 50% of the deposited waste dumped at landfills and open dump sites can be recycled as energy or reused as raw materials. These materials can be used as secondary resources in different industries instead of being forgotten or viewed as garbage,\" Jani explains.\n\nHis research also includes the extraction of metals from Sm\u00e5land's art and crystal glass waste and different fine fractions.\n\nExtracting 99 % of the metals\n\n\"I developed a method that enables the extraction of 99% of the metals from the glass waste that was dumped at Pukeberg's glassworks and published the results. It is the first published article in the world that deals with recycling of metals from art and crystal glass,\" says Jani.\n\nIn his research study at Glasriket, Jani also used chemical extraction to recycle materials from a mix of glass waste and soil fine fractions smaller than 2 mm. The technology involves mixing old glass waste with chemicals to reduce the melting point of the glass waste in order to extract the metals.\n\n\"The methods I've developed to extract metals from Sm\u00e5land's glass waste can be used to extract metals from all types of glass, like, for instance, the glass in old TV sets and computers. Thus, this method can be further developed at an industrial facility for the recycling of both glass and metals of high purity. This can also contribute to a restoration of Sm\u00e5land's glass industry by providing the industry with cheap raw materials. In addition, the extraction of materials from old landfills contributes to the decontamination of these sites and reduces the environmental impact and health threats\" Jani concludes.\n\nAccording to the European commission in 2017, 60% (that is to say, 1,800 million tons) of the annually produced waste from 500 million EU inhabitants end up in landfills. In his dissertation, Jani shows that the extraction of valuable materials from this waste could contribute to reducing the overuse of natural resources on Earth and reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and contaminated leachates, which are responsible for pollution of water resources. Decontamination of these places will contribute to a significantly reduced impact on both human health and the environment.\n\nThe results from Jani's dissertation shed light on the need to view the dumped waste as a secondary resource and landfills and dumpsites as future bank accounts where future raw materials can be extracted instead of viewing them as a burden for human health and the environment.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323090956.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T14:09:56", "title": "Keeping a tight hold on things: Robot-mounted vacuum grippers flex their artificial muscles", "text": "A short electric pulse is all it takes to generate and release a powerful vacuum in the blink of an eye. The novel vacuum gripper developed by the research team led by Professor Stefan Seelecke at Saarland University enables robot arms to pick up objects and move them around freely in space. The system works without the need for compressed air to generate the vacuum, it is energy efficient, quiet and suitable for use in clean rooms. The specialists for intelligent materials systems make use of artificial muscles, which are bundles of ultrafine shape memory wires that are able to tense and relax just as real muscle fibres do. The wires also function as sensors and can sense, for example, when the gripper needs to readjust or tighten its grip.\n\nFrom April 23th to April 27th, the engineering team from Saarbr\u00fccken will be at Hannover Messe exhibiting the capabilities of their vacuum grippers at the Saarland Research and Innovation Stand (Hall 2, Stand B46). The team is looking for industrial partners with whom they can develop their system for specific practical applications.\n\nVacuum grippers are common tools in industrial production lines, where they are used to sort, convey and hold smooth and relatively flat objects so that screws can be driven in, surfaces painted or components assembled. Using vacuum grippers is typically a fairly noisy affair. The most common systems use compressed air, which not only makes them loud, but also means they need heavy ancillary equipment, which drives up costs and makes the entire system somewhat inflexible. They also consume significant amounts of energy.\n\nThe situation is quite different in the case of the new vacuum technology that has been developed by Professor Stefan Seelecke of Saarland University and the Center for Mechatronics and Automation Technology in Saarbr\u00fccken (ZeMA). The shape-memory vacuum gripper can produce a powerful vacuum using nothing more than a robot arm to guide it into position. It does not require any additional electric or pneumatic drive system, it is light, adaptable, cost-effective to produce, and it runs noiselessly. It only needs electric current -- more precisely, it needs small pulses of electric current: one to generate the vacuum and one to release it. No additional electric power needs to be supplied while the gripper is holding an object, even if the object has to be gripped for a long time or if it has to be held at an angle.\n\nThe technology is based on the shape memory properties of nickel-titanium alloy. 'The term \"shape memory\" refers to the fact that the material is able to \"remember\" its shape and to return to that original shape after it has been deformed. If electric current flows through a wire made from this alloy, the wire becomes warmer and its lattice structure transforms in such a way that the wire shortens in length. If the current ceases, the wire cools down and lengthens again,' says Stefan Seelecke, explaining the key underlying material phase transitions. The ultrafine wires therefore contract and relax like muscle fibres, depending on whether an electric current is flowing or not. 'These shape memory wires have the highest energy density of all known drive mechanisms, which enables them to perform powerful movements in restricted spaces,' explains Seelecke.\n\nTo construct a vacuum gripper, the researchers arrange bundles of these fibres in the manner of a circular muscle around a thin metal disc that can flip up or down, like a frog clicker toy. Applying an electrical pulse makes the wires in the 'muscle' contract and the disc flips position. The disc is attached to a rubber membrane and if the membrane has been placed onto a flat smooth surface, when the disc flips position it pulls on the membrane, creating a strong and stable vacuum. By bundling the wires together, the resulting motion is both powerful and very rapid. 'Multiple ultrathin wires provide a large surface area through which they can transfer heat, which means they can cool down very swiftly. As a result, the bundle of fibres can shorten and lengthen rapidly, making it possible for the gripper to grab or release an object very quickly,' explains Susanne-Marie Kirsch. Kirsch and her research colleague Felix Welsch are research assistants within the group and are developing and optimizing the vacuum gripper technology as part of their doctoral research studies. 'Currently, the gripper is able to securely hold objects weighing several kilograms. The gripper's lifting capacity is scalable, with correspondingly more wires being used in large grippers,' explains Felix Welsch.\n\nAnd because the material from which the wires are made has sensory properties, the vacuum gripper is itself aware if the object is not being held securely. 'The wires provide all the necessary information. The electrical resistance data correlates precisely with the extent of deformation of the wires. By interpreting the measurement data, the controller unit therefore knows the exact position of the wires at any one time,' says Professor Seelecke. The gripper thus has an autonomous means of determining whether or not its vacuum is stable enough for the current task. It can also issue warnings in the event of a malfunction or material fatigue.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323090853.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T14:08:53", "title": "Treating oily water: Efficiency exceeds requirements 10 times", "text": "Wastewater cleaning technology created at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU), Lithuania efficiently cleans water from oil products leaving it virtually pollution-free (the concentration of oil discharge in treated water is about 0.2 mg/L).

Students in lower sets typically faced a reduced curriculum based on more structural, repetitive tasks, and more one-to-one time with teachers. Teachers of these pupils were often reluctant to risk overstretching them by teaching overly complex content.\n\nAs lead author of the article, Dr Anna Mazenod from the UCL Institute of Education in the UK, explains: \"Our findings suggest that secondary school students in the so-called bottom sets may be unintentionally encouraged to remain more dependent on their teachers in comparison with their peers in higher sets.\n\n\"Teachers tend to perceive bottom-set students as more 'dependent learners', and may not build in scope to allow for students to develop their independent learning skills.

One teacher claimed, 'if you get put in a Set 6 class, you get treated like a Set 6 pupil'.\n\n\"Teachers have to strike a careful balance between directing students in their learning and enabling students to become independent learners,\" added Mazenod. \"We suggest that schools that adopt attainment grouping carefully consider whether equality of opportunity and high expectations are being adequately targeted at their lower set pupils, and whether their grouping could be improved to better support attainment and engagement for all.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323084834.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T13:48:34", "title": "Rival competition makes ant sperm better swimmers", "text": "Ant sperm recognize rival sperm and become more mobile, faster and straighter swimmers as a result, according to a study published in the open access journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. The study looked at the factors that modify sperm behavior when there is competition with sperm from other males in a social insect which only mates on a single day during its lifetime.\n\nResearchers at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark found that mixing ejaculates from different male ants in vitro increased the number of mobile sperm by 50% compared to control samples which had been mixed with a saline solution. Sperm mixed with rival ejaculates were also more than 20% faster and swam in straighter lines compared to controls.\n\nDr Joanito Liberti, the first author of the study said: \"Ants are peculiar in that all their sexual activity is carried out during a single mating event early in adult life. When ant queens mate with multiple males their sperm have a single time-window to compete with rival ejaculates for storage in the reproductive organs of the queens. We discovered a fine-tuned mechanism of sperm motility that appears to be regulated by reproductive secretions from both male and queen ants. The findings suggest that sperm are able to assess the level of sperm competition and adjust their level of movement (motility), and thus energy expenditure, accordingly.\"\n\nIn a series of follow up experiments, the authors found that the increase in sperm motility when mixing ejaculates was induced by the seminal fluid of rival males, not by their sperm, and that a similar increase could also be induced by mixing sperm with the reproductive tract fluid of queens. This fluid is made in the spermatheca, the female organ that receives and stores sperm. The increases in sperm motility that followed contact with fluids of other males or sexual partners went well beyond increases in motility that were observed when sperm were mixed with own seminal fluid. The proportion of mobile sperm, their swimming speed and linearity were 40%, 15% and 8% higher when exposed to rival seminal fluid or queen secretions than when exposed to own seminal fluid.\n\nProfessor Jacobus Boomsma, senior author of the study said: \"Previous studies by our group showed a decrease in sperm survival after exposure to seminal fluid from rival males in the same leaf-cutting ant species that our current study is about. So we would have expected similar negative effects of rival seminal fluid on sperm motility, but we found the opposite result. Our observation that rival male seminal fluid enhances sperm motility more than own seminal fluid does, suggests that sperm have evolved a self-non-self-recognition mechanism to regulate motility.\"\n\nThe finding that changes in sperm motility, swimming speed and linearity are less pronounced in the presence of own seminal fluid also suggests that enhanced mobility is costly to ant males, for example because it may place sperm under oxidative stress, according to the authors. This, in turn, may impact the long-term viability of the sperm when they are stored within the female reproductive tract. As females store and use sperm to fertilize eggs over many years, sperm viability over time is important to both males and females. Whether increased motility really is associated with higher oxidative stress needs to be investigated in future experiments.\n\nThe authors extracted sperm from male Acromyrex echinatior leaf-cutting ants collected in Gamboa, Panama between 2002 and 2014 and mixed the sperm either with a saline solution, with own seminal fluid, with rival seminal fluid, or with both own and rival seminal fluid. They then used microscopy techniques to measure the rate of movement, the speed and the directionality of the sperm as they swam. In further experiments the authors also exposed sperm to fluids from the female reproductive tract, in combination with own, rival or no seminal fluid. The authors caution that their aim was not to replicate the natural environment that sperm encounter after insemination. Rather, they studied the sex-specific factors that modify sperm competition and sperm storage in a social insect whose females may live for decades but complete their life-time mating activity on a single day early in adult life when they disperse to found new colonies.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323084827.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T13:48:27", "title": "Analyzing past failures may boost future performance by reducing stress: Study shows for first time that writing critically about past setbacks leads to lower stress responses, better choices and bett", "text": "Insights from past failures can help boost performance on a new task -- and a new study is the first to explain why.

The girls performed better on the tests, and had more working memory. However, boys showed no correlation between working memory and performance, while girls did. Looking at brain activity, fNIRS revealed that boys showed increased activation with proficiency in the front of the brain when they heard a correct sentence, while girls showed more at the back. The front is linked with \"syntactic\" processing i.e. rule-based understanding of sentences; the back is associated with a wider range of language processing. Interestingly, boys displayed an overall decreased response for incorrect sentences; girls showed the exact opposite.\n\nERPs also showed disparities, with boys exhibiting a strong response to incorrect sentences from an early time, a phase thought to be associated with \"syntactic\" processing. Girls only showed a difference between correct and incorrect sentences at later times.\n\nThe emerging picture is of two different strategies to cope with a second language. Boys leverage efficient processing and rule-based \"implicit\" thinking; girls draw on a wider range of linguistic information, achieving \"explicit\" comprehension of sentences. A cursory look at test scores may have simply pointed to girls being \"better\" at learning English, but the mechanisms tell a far more interesting story.\n\nA clearer picture of how boys and girls learn a second language (in this case, English) has the potential to revolutionize teaching in schools, building methods and syllabi to address directly strengths and weaknesses for both boys and girls.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180323084818.htm", "published": "2018-03-23T13:48:18", "title": "The brain learns completely differently than we've assumed since the 20th century", "text": "The brain is a complex network containing billions of neurons, where each of these neurons communicates simultaneously with thousands of other via their synapses (links). However, the neuron actually collects its many synaptic incoming signals through several extremely long ramified \"arms\" only, called dendritic trees.\n\nIn 1949 Donald Hebb's pioneering work suggested that learning occurs in the brain by modifying the strength of the synapses, whereas neurons function as the computational elements in the brain. This has remained the common assumption until today.\n\nUsing new theoretical results and experiments on neuronal cultures, a group of scientists, led by Prof. Ido Kanter, of the Department of Physics and the Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar-Ilan University, has demonstrated that the central assumption for nearly 70 years that learning occurs only in the synapses is mistaken.\n\nIn an article published today in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers go against conventional wisdom to show that learning is actually done by several dendrites, similar to the slow learning mechanism currently attributed to the synapses.\n\n\"The newly discovered process of learning in the dendrites occurs at a much faster rate than in the old scenario suggesting that learning occurs solely in the synapses. In this new dendritic learning process, there are a few adaptive parameters per neuron, in comparison to thousands of tiny and sensitive ones in the synaptic learning scenario,\" said Prof. Kanter, whose research team includes Shira Sardi, Roni Vardi, Anton Sheinin, Amir Goldental and Herut Uzan.\n\nThe newly suggested learning scenario indicates that learning occurs in a few dendrites that are in much closer proximity to the neuron, as opposed to the previous notion. \"Does it make sense to measure the quality of air we breathe via many tiny, distant satellite sensors at the elevation of a skyscraper, or by using one or several sensors in close proximity to the nose? Similarly, it is more efficient for the neuron to estimate its incoming signals close to its computational unit, the neuron,\" says Kanter. Hebb's theory has been so deeply rooted in the scientific world for 70 years that no one has ever proposed such a different approach. Moreover, synapses and dendrites are connected to the neuron in a series, so the exact localized site of the learning process seemed irrelevant.\n\nAnother important finding of the study is that weak synapses, previously assumed to be insignificant even though they comprise the majority of our brain, play an important role in the dynamics of our brain. They induce oscillations of the learning parameters rather than pushing them to unrealistic fixed extremes, as suggested in the current synaptic learning scenario.\n\nThe new learning scenario occurs in different sites of the brain and therefore calls for a reevaluation of current treatments for disordered brain functionality. Hence, the popular phrase \"neurons that fire together wire together,\" summarizing Donald Hebb's 70-year-old hypothesis, must now be rephrased. In addition, the learning mechanism is at the basis of recent advanced machine learning and deep learning achievements. The change in the learning paradigm opens new horizons for different types of deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence based applications imitating our brain functions, but with advanced features and at a much faster speed.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180322181401.htm", "published": "2018-03-22T23:14:01", "title": "Epidural stimulation shown to normalize blood pressure following spinal cord injury: Research supports future study of beneficial effects of stimulation", "text": "Patients with severe spinal cord injury (SCI) often experience chronically low blood pressure that negatively affects their health, their quality of life and their ability to engage in rehabilitative therapy.\n\n\"People with severe spinal cord injury -- especially when it occurs in a higher level in the spine -- have problems with blood pressure regulation to the point that it becomes the main factor affecting quality of life for them,\"said Glenn Hirsch, M.D., professor of cardiology at the University of Louisville (UofL). \"Some cannot even sit up without passing out. They are forced to use medications, compression stockings or abdominal binders to maintain an adequate blood pressure.\"\n\nWorking with human research participants, Hirsch and researchers at the Kentucky Spinal Cord injury Research Center (KSCIRC) at UofL, have found that spinal cord epidural stimulation can safely and effectively elevate blood pressure in individuals with SCI along with chronic hypotension. The research was reported this month in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience (Normalization of Blood Pressure with Spinal Cord Epidural Stimulation After Severe Spinal Cord Injury).\n\nLed by Susan Harkema, Ph.D., associate director of KSCIRC and professor of neurosurgery, the research included four research participants with chronic, motor complete, cervical SCI who suffered from persistent low resting blood pressure. The participants were implanted with an electrode array for epidural stimulation, and individual configurations for stimulation were identified for each participant. During five two-hour sessions, the participants' blood pressure was elevated to normal ranges. Their blood pressure returned to low levels when stimulation ceased, and was again elevated to normal ranges with stimulation.\n\nStefanie Putnam was one of the research participants. Following a severe spinal cord injury in 2009, Putnam's blood pressure was so low she was unable to engage in the simplest of activities without losing consciousness.\n\n\"It prevented me from participating in activities, from talking on the phone, from sitting at a table and eating food. I had trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, trouble carrying on a conversation,\" Putnam said. \"I was passing out periodically -- six or more times a day. Then I would have to tilt back in the chair for two hours.\"\n\nTo help sustain her blood pressure, Putnam took medication, wore an extremely tight corset and drank a large amount of caffeine.\n\n\"I would still pass out,\" she said.\n\nWith epidural stimulation, Putnam said she immediately felt the effects.\n\n\"I went from feeling like I was glued to the floor to elevated -- as though gravity was not weighing me down. I feel alive!\" she said.\n\nBecause of the undesirable side effects of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, Hirsch said epidural stimulation for chronic low blood pressure in SCI could have significant benefits.\n\n\"People with severe SCI who have problems with resting hypotension have limited options. This intervention appears to reliably and reproducibly maintain blood pressure\" Hirsch said.\n\nThis work builds on previous research at KSCIRC showing benefits of spinal cord epidural stimulation, along with activity-based training, in which individuals with SCI have achieved voluntary movement, standing and stepping, and improved bladder, bowel and sexual function.\n\nHarkema, the publication's first author, said the blood-pressure research is promising, but must be tested over time and with a larger cohort of study participants.\n\n\"We need to see if it will have an impact over months or years,\" Harkema said. \"It will be very important to determine if these results are sustainable.\"\n\nTo that end, UofL is screening participants for a six-year study that will further explore the life-enhancing effects of epidural stimulation on people with spinal cord injury (SCI). That study will measure the extent to which epidural stimulation will improve cardiovascular function as well as facilitate the ability to stand and voluntarily control leg movements below the injury level in 36 participants with chronic, complete spinal cord injuries.

The study is published online by JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nOver the last 30 years the number of obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes has dramatically increased. Diabetes drugs control blood glucose for most people with type 2 diabetes, but for severely obese teenagers, nearly half will need insulin therapy within one year of diagnosis, says study coauthor Lori Laffel, MD, MPH, Chief, Pediatric, Adolescent and Young Adult Section at Joslin Diabetes Center.\n\nIn the analysis, Dr. Laffel and colleagues from multiple institutions looked at existing data from two studies -- the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) and Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY).\n\nThis study is the first to compare glycemic control in two groups of very obese adolescents with type 2 diabetes. It included 30 teenagers treated with medication (TODAY) and 63 teenagers who underwent bariatric surgery (Teen-LABs).\n\nTeen-LABS examined the effectiveness and safety of weight loss surgery in teenagers. The key finding was that those who underwent the procedure showed significant improvements in cardiovascular disease risk factors. The key finding from TODAY was that metformin in combination with rosiglitazone resulted in more effective blood glucose control than metformin alone, or metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention.\n\nIn this analysis, researchers compared clinical outcomes at the two year mark and found that bariatric surgery was much more likely to improve blood glucose control than medication. In those who underwent bariatric surgery, two years on A1c dropped from 6.8 to 5.5, whereas in those who received medication, A1c increased from 6.4 to 7.8.\n\n\"In Teen-LABS, about 70 percent of participants achieved a normal A1c (below 5.7) at the two year point, compared to only 10 percent of those in the TODAY study,\" says Dr. Laffel.\n\nIn addition, those who underwent weight loss surgery weighed, on average, 29 percent less than prior to surgery, whereas those who were treated with diabetes medication weighed 3.7 percent more. Also, the analysis showed significant improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels and kidney function in teenagers treated surgically, but not in those treated with medication.\n\nBut just because metabolic outcomes were better doesn't mean that bariatric surgery is an option for everyone.\n\n\"We do have to recognize that this is not a head-to-head comparison,\" says Dr. Laffel. \"We also have to recognize that almost a quarter of the bariatric patients needed additional operations and patient care after surgery, so that approach is not without potential morbid complications.\"\n\nWhat the study actually uncovered is that there is a need to find better ways to treat type 2 diabetes in this population. That might mean developing more family-based approaches to weight management or starting lifestyle programs at an even younger age.\n\n\"Gastric bypass is something you want to enter thoughtfully. Patients and their family need to be aware that complications and the need for reoperation could occur, as well as the fact they will need to revise and transform their approach to eating,\" says Dr. Laffel. \"Our study suggests that if medical and lifestyle approaches fail, bariatric surgery should be considered.\"\n\nThese findings will need to be confirmed in additional studies.\n\nThe study coauthors include Thomas H.

This time, he and his colleagues demonstrated how to make a battery-sized pellet, but the graphene powders with chemical functionalities attached to it can be pressed into any form. Kabbani said the material could be suitable for structural, catalytic, electrochemical and electronic applications.\n\n\"This is the first time anyone's made these at room temperature and without very high pressure,\" he said. \"Usually these kind of materials require sintering (a process that uses pressure or heat to form solids without melting them) at temperatures above 1,000 degrees Celsius to produce strong pellets. In this case, mechano-chemistry at the nanoscale saved us a lot of energy and money.\"\n\nThe process began with two sets of functionalized nanotubes, one with carboxylic acid and the other with hydroxyl molecules. Once crushed to combine them either by hand or machine, they are placed in a lab-scale hydraulic press and subjected to 5 tons of pressure. The functional groups cross-linked the graphene sheets to each other, and even though no liquids were involved, they produced a tiny amount of water as a byproduct of the reaction, Kabbani said.\n\nThe pellets remained stable when placed in hot water for five hours, even when stirred; this confirmed the interlocking of the graphene sheets within, the researchers reported.\n\nThe combination of light weight, high strength and high conductivity is appealing for applications such as conducting cables and electrodes, Kabbani said. \"The pellet material is stronger and lighter than commercial graphite electrodes and could be promising for electrical storage applications with high energy and power densities,\" he said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180322181338.htm", "published": "2018-03-22T23:13:38", "title": "Using light to turn yeast into biochemical factories", "text": "Scientists have recently learned how to use light to control specific groups of neurons to better understand the operation of the brain, a development that has transformed areas of neuroscience.\n\nResearchers at Princeton University have now applied a similar method to controlling the metabolism, or basic chemical process, of a living cell. In a series of experiments, they used light to control genetically-modified yeast and increase its output of commercially valuable chemicals. The results offer scientists a powerful new tool to probe and understand the inner working of cells.\n\n\"This technique allows us to control the metabolism of cells in an unprecedented way,\" said co-lead researcher Jos\u00e9 L. Avalos, an assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering and Princeton's Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. \"It opens the door to controlling metabolism with light.\"\n\nYeast has been used for centuries to make bread, wine and beer. Through fermentation, yeast cells transform sugar into chemicals that make bread rise and turn grape juice into wine. Using their new technique, the Princeton researchers have now used fermentation and genetically-engineered yeast to produce other chemicals including lactic acid, used in food production and bioplastics, and isobutanol, a commodity chemical and an advanced biofuel.\n\nLight played a key role in the experiment because it allowed the researchers to switch on genes that they had added to the yeast cells. These particular genes are sensitive to light, which can trigger or suppress their activity. In one case, turning on and off a blue light caused the special yeast to alternate between producing ethanol, a product of normal fermentation, and isobutanol, a chemical that normally would kill yeast at sufficiently high concentration.\n\nThe achievement of producing these chemicals was significant, but the researchers were intrigued by the development of light's broader role in metabolic research.\n\n\"It provides a new tool with the ability to do sophisticated experiments to determine how metabolism works and how to engineer it,\" Avalos said.\n\nIn a March 21 paper in the journal Nature, the researchers reported that they used light to increase yeast's production of the chemical isobutanol as much as 5times higher than previously reported levels in peer-reviewed studies The researchers used a genetically modified strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the experiments.\n\nIsobutanol is an alcohol used in products such as lubricants, gasoline and jet fuel replacements, and plastics. With good compatibility with gasoline infrastructure, isobutanol has properties that could make it a direct substitute for gas as a vehicle fuel. However, most attempts to create isobutanol biofuel have run into difficulties involving cost or scaling production to an industrial level. Although natural yeast fermentation produces isobutanol, it does so in miniscule amounts. Instead, yeast makes high volumes of ethanol (the alcohol in beer and wine) and carbon dioxide (a gas that makes bread rise).\n\n\"Yeast don't want to make anything but ethanol; all their systems have evolved to do this,\" said Evan M. Zhao, a third-year Ph.D. student in Avalos' lab and lead author on the Nature paper. \"This has been an age-old problem.\"\n\nThe researchers sought to overcome this barrier. They managed to suppress the yeast's evolutionary self-interest by genetically engineering it to produce large quantities of isobutanol. But they faced a major problem. Isobutanol is toxic to yeast and eventually kills yeast colonies that produce it in any significant quantity. The researchers predicted they could use a combination of genetic engineering and light to fine tune isobutanol production. Using their light-switch technique, the researchers set out to keep the yeast alive while maximizing isobutanol production.\n\nThe researchers started by putting a modified gene from a marine bacterium that is controllable by blue light into yeast's DNA. They then used light to turn on a chemical process that activates enzymes that naturally allow yeast to grow and multiply by eating glucose and secreting ethanol. But while those enzymes are active, ones that influence the production of isobutanol can't work. So the team turned to darkness to switch off the ethanol-producing enzymes to make room for the expression of their competitors.\n\n\"Normally light turns expression on,\" said Jared E. Toettcher, assistant professor of molecular biology and co-lead researcher, \"but we also had to figure out how to make the absence of light turn another expression on.\"\n\nThe challenge was to find the right balance of light and dark, given that yeast cells die when their natural fermentation process is disturbed, Zhao said: \"The yeast get sick. They don't do anything anymore; they just stop.\"\n\nThe researchers allowed the cells to grow by giving them bursts of blue light every few hours. In between they turned the light off to shift their metabolism from powering growth to producing isobutanol. Before the cells completely arrested, the researchers dispersed more bursts of light.\n\n\"Just enough light to keep the cells alive,\" said Toettcher, \"but still crank out a whole lot of product that you want, which they produce only in the dark.\"\n\nUsing light to control yeast's chemical production offers several advantages over techniques involving pure genetic engineering or chemical additives. For one, light is much faster and cheaper than most alternatives. It's also adjustable, meaning that turning it on and off can toggle the function of live cells on the spot at any point in the fermentation process (as opposed to chemicals, which generally can't be turned off once they are added.) Also, unlike chemical manipulators that diffuse throughout a cell, light can be applied to specific genes without affecting other parts of the cell.\n\nOptogenetics, as the use of light to control genes is called, is already used in neuroscience and other fields, but this the first application of the technology to control cellular metabolism for chemical production. Gregory Stephanopoulos, an MIT chemical engineering professor who was not involved with Princeton's research, called it a turning point in the field of metabolic engineering.\n\n\"It offers a brand new approach to the control of gene expression in microbial cultivation,\" Prof. Stephanopoulos said.\n\nThe work and resulting paper were the culmination of interdisciplinary collaboration between Avalos's and Toettcher's labs.\n\nBoth started working at Princeton in the winter of 2015 and immediately saw an opportunity to work together. Zhao worked in both labs.\n\n\"Within our first month we wanted to use light to control metabolic engineering,\" Toettcher said.\n\nAvalos said the researchers are working to improve their results. They have recently tested different colors of light to activate various proteins and cut the time needed for yeast to produce desired chemicals. But he said they would ultimately like to expand the scope of their work.\n\n\"We intend to keep pushing,\" Avalos said. \"But metabolic engineering transcends industrial microbiology. It also allows us to study the metabolism of cells for health-related problems. You can control metabolism in any context, for industrial biology or to address medical questions.\"\n\nOther authors on the paper were Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering graduate students Yanfei Zhang, Justin Mehl, Helen Park, and Makoto A.

He says he will stay on to advise his eldest son, Victor Li, who will inherit his two main businesses. The first is CK Hutchison, a conglomerate with interests in power plants, perfume and much in between. It runs 52 ports and owns 14,000 high-street stores, including Watsons at home and Superdrug in Britain. The second is CK Asset, one of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest property developers. Combined they are worth $79.7bn.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the press conference the younger Mr Li made all the right noises. \u201cWhen I return to work tomorrow, it will be the same,\u201d he told investors.

His father\u2019s willingness to cut him off and answer reporters\u2019 questions himself may have reassured them that he really will stick around.\n\nSuccession is a delicate matter. Joseph Fan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has found that family-run firms in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan lose 60% of their value on average in the years before and after a change. Many a tycoon has proved hopeless at planning for his departure. Discussing death is regarded as unlucky. Most cling on past their prime.\n\nNot so the meticulous Mr Li. As early as 2000 it became clear that Victor would inherit his empire, after his second son, Richard, stepped down as deputy chairman of Hutchison Whampoa (now CK Hutchison) and went his own way. In 2012 Mr Li made this line of succession official.\n\nAccording to Oliver Rui of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, Mr Li also simplified a complex holding structure in 2015 with the handover in mind. He split property holdings from other assets, boosting both firms\u2019 valuations and making it easier for his son to sell off bits of the empire in future.\n\nMr Li has also been reinvesting his fortune in stable, cash-generating assets in Europe. These now account for close to two-thirds of CK Hutchison\u2019s operating profit, compared with just 16% from Hong Kong and mainland China. In November he sold a 73-storey skyscraper on Hong Kong island for $5.2bn, and since 2013 has parted with $3bn-worth of commercial properties in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nAlthough both father and son speak of continuity, many in Hong Kong see Li senior\u2019s exit as the end of an era\u2014and not just for his empire. Mr Li came to Hong Kong as a wartime refugee, fleeing Guangdong with his family in 1940 at the age of 12. His father died soon afterwards, and he was taken out of school and put to work. In 1950 he was among the first in the British colony to get into the plastics business. His plastic flowers were a hit. (His future wife came from a well-off industrial family, helping with credit and connections.) When property prices slumped during riots in 1967 he pounced, setting up his first property company in 1971. The timing was propitious; Hong Kong\u2019s economy grew by 9% a year on average in that decade.\n\nHe went on to operate container ports, and belonged to the first wave of outsiders to invest in China when it opened up in the late 1970s. In Hong Kong he bought into everything from groceries to pharmacies, and supplied swathes of the city with electricity. Through Hutchison, an old British trading house that he bought in 1979 (the first time a Chinese took control of a British firm), he expanded abroad in a way no other local tycoon has. Unusually for a head of a family firm, he sought out professional managers, many of them foreign.\n\nThe incoming boss has worked with some of them for decades. Victor is credited with CK Hutchison\u2019s push into overseas utilities, including three big recent investments in energy infrastructure in Australia, Canada and Germany. Still, if he has his own vision for the business, it may not become apparent for two to three years, says Mr Rui.\n\nIt could use fresh thinking. Two decades ago, Mr Li\u2019s stocks were among the ten most actively traded on Hong Kong\u2019s exchange, according to Bloomberg, a data provider. Now they are outside the top 30. A foray into biotech has been ho-hum.\n\nAs for Hong Kong, it is less fertile ground for would-be tycoons than before. Oligopolies are entrenched locally. Mainland China, meanwhile, produces a dollar billionaire every five days. Pony Ma and Jack Ma, (unrelated) founders of Tencent and Alibaba, two tech giants, are richer than Mr Li.

(There are historical echoes, too, in Mr Trump\u2019s plans to slap tariffs on a range of Chinese imports; in the 1980s Japan was the target.) A rhyme is not a repeat. But past experience is not encouraging.\n\nThe central problem for America\u2019s policymakers is that trade is like water. Block its flow in one place and pressure builds elsewhere. When many countries are covered by tariffs, trade may simply be diverted through those countries that are let off the hook. Importers will howl for exemptions. As a result, whatever the Trump administration\u2019s broader ambitions with respect to trade, bellicose unilateralism will make them harder to achieve.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1982 America browbeat the European Community, the forerunner of the European Union, into limiting its steel exports to America. But compensating flows from other countries were so great that America\u2019s steel imports increased overall. Exemptions for Canada, Mexico, Israel and Jordan when George W. Bush imposed tariffs on steel imports in 2002 allowed the value of their exports to America to surge by 53%. Canadian and Mexican exporters, who are exempt from the latest tariffs, already account for a big share of American imports (see chart 1). They could clean up.\n\nIn an attempt to stop such substitution Robert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, is said to be offering to spare America\u2019s allies from the tariffs if they ensure their exports to America do not exceed the level in 2017. On March 21st he hinted that negotiations could last until late April. But such a deal would break the World Trade Organisation\u2019s rules, and put bureaucrats, not markets, in charge of allocating export rights.\n\nWhen different countries receive different treatment, circumventing tariffs looks more tempting. Under Mr Obama, America imposed hefty anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese steel. Inflows from China duly fell, but those from Vietnam surged. America\u2019s Commerce Department recently concluded that some steel imports, supposedly from Vietnam, actually originated in China. Mr Trump expects Canada and Mexico to ensure they do not become conduits for steel originating elsewhere. But that may be hard, especially for the generic, less processed stuff.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s tariff barriers are broader than Mr Obama\u2019s were. That makes circumvention harder\u2014but also means importers will squeal more loudly for exemptions. After Mr Bush\u2019s steel safeguards were applied to the EU and Japan in 2002, companies cut off from their suppliers expended much time and money pleading their case in Washington. Eventually 1,022 exemptions were granted, over 90% of them to firms importing from Japan and the EU. This time, the Trump administration expects to spend 24,000 worker-hours processing 4,500 requests to exempt steel products and 1,500 pleas for aluminium. Lobbyists are rubbing their hands.\n\nMetal consumers will also seek to be spared pricier inputs, which can threaten jobs. In 2002 the employers of Gordon Jones, a steel-drum loader, were thwacked with a 30% tariff. \u201cThey say that these tariffs are supposed to help workers, to save steel jobs, but what about me?\u201d Mr Jones asked a congressional hearing. More such complaints will come, since steel-consuming sectors account for far more American jobs than steel production (see chart 2).\n\nTariffs are not Mr Trump\u2019s only trade policy. As well as trying to rewrite the North American Free-Trade Agreement, he is trying to curb China\u2019s trade power. Whatever the merits of these aims, the new tariffs will make it harder to rally allies to his side. \u201cIssues like this have a way of overtaking any meeting or any discussion you\u2019re having,\u201d says Wendy Cutler, a trade negotiator under Mr Obama.\n\nBill Brock, who was the United States Trade Representative under Reagan, recalls negotiating trade restrictions with Japan in the 1980s. Even amid tensions, he remembers treating Japanese negotiators with respect, knowing that harm to one part of the trade relationship could affect others. Tariffs are \u201csingle-shot measures to deal with single issues\u201d, he warns, and risk complicating efforts to resolve broader ones. \u201cOf all the stupid self-defeating things we can imagine, a trade war is the top of the list.\u201d", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21739163-cape-crusaders-defend-their-favourite-measure-wall-street-looks-overvalued?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-22T16:47:55", "title": "Wall Street looks overvalued", "text": "FEW measures of stockmarket valuation are as controversial as the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE. American equities have looked expensive on this measure for most of the past 20 years, which is why many bulls tend to dismiss its usefulness. It is pretty clear that the CAPE does not help investors to time the market.\n\nBut a new paper* from Research Affiliates, a fund-management group, explains why many criticisms are overblown. The strongest case for the measure is that a higher ratio tends to be associated with lower long-term returns. A study of 12 national markets shows that a 5% increase in the CAPE, from 20 to 21, say, tends on average to reduce the total ten-year expected return by four percentage points.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attraction of the CAPE is that it smooths out the vicissitudes of the profit cycle. In a recession, profits can plunge even faster than share prices. So if you look only at the ratio of a share price and the previous year\u2019s profits, the market can look very expensive. Since it is a moving average of profits over ten years, the CAPE is less volatile. Past peaks have coincided with the top of bull markets, as in 1929 and 2000 (see chart). It is now well above its long-term average.\n\nCritics say that the high value of the CAPE can be easily explained. One argument is that profits have shifted to a permanently higher level. Accounting standards have changed and modern companies, such as Google and Facebook, have more market power. Another line of argument is that, regardless of the level of profits, valuations should be higher. Demographic changes mean that baby-boomers are piling into equities as they prepare to retire. Low real interest rates mean future profits, when discounted, are worth more today. General economic and financial risks have fallen.\n\nThe paper tries to tackle those arguments. The authors accept that the current level of profits is high. But they do not believe that this means future profits growth will necessarily be strong. There is a tendency to revert to the mean. Historically, rapid growth in profits over a ten-year period is associated with slower growth over the next decade. Furthermore, the high level of profits is linked to slow growth in wages. That has led to a populist backlash, which could result in higher taxes on companies or restrictions on trade.\n\nThe demographic argument also has its flaws. The baby-boomers are already in the process of retiring, which means they will be running down their savings pots rather than building them up. Furthermore, the ageing population means that the workforce will grow more slowly in future. Other things being equal, that will be bad for both economic growth and profits.\n\nAs for the impact of low interest rates, a lot depends on why rates are low. If they are depressed because central banks expect slow economic growth, that is not great for equities. Arguments based on low macroeconomic volatility tend to be hostages to fortune; there was much talk of the \u201cgreat moderation\u201d in the early 2000s, just before the financial crisis hit.\n\nFinally, other countries also have low interest rates, reduced volatility and ageing populations, without their markets trading on anything like the CAPE that Wall Street does. America\u2019s ratio is 32.8, whereas Canada is trading on a CAPE of 20. Germany is on 19 and Britain on 14. All are trading near their historical averages; in contrast, Wall Street is at double its usual level. America may have more powerful companies, but that is a very large gap to attribute to a single factor. Alternative measures of stockmarket valuation, which compare share prices with corporate sales or asset values, also show that Wall Street looks expensive, relative to history, but that other countries (particularly emerging markets) look cheap.\n\nPlenty of sceptics will fail to be convinced by this reasoning. They will point out that the American CAPE has been consistently over 20 since 2011, well above its historic average of 16.8. Yet the markets have continued to perform well, admittedly helped by a huge amount of stimulus from the central banks.\n\nBut they should consider what their optimism implies for the future. American pension funds are expecting returns of 7-8% from their portfolios. That would require some combination of decent economic growth, continued low interest rates, a bigger share of profits in GDP and even higher valuations.

For many of them (the central bankers, that is), the past decade has been an unusually angst-ridden one. They stumbled through it, confused by the way their policymaking bodies were changing, unsure what to do with their interest rates, embarrassed by their burgeoning balance-sheets. Teenagers often seek to quell their anxiety and insecurity by imitating behaviour they regard as normal. So too for central bankers.\n\nBut the desire to normalise policy, and leave crisis-era measures behind, could distract central bankers from their main goals, namely to support growth and control inflation. The Bank for International Settlements, a global club for central bankers, recently urged officials not to let market jitters discourage them from raising interest rates. Yet at worst, chasing some elusive notion of normal could put the global recovery at risk.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat central bankers mean by normalising policy is clear enough. As Peter Praet, the chief economist of the European Central Bank (ECB), explained in a recent speech, to normalise is to end their reliance on \u201cunconventional\u201d or \u201cnon-standard\u201d tools such as quantitative easing (QE, the printing of new money to buy assets). It means returning to a familiar world in which adjustments to interest rates are their main policy lever.\n\nCentral bankers make no secret of their longing to return to this normality. When, in his first monetary-policy report to Congress, Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, praised his predecessor, Janet Yellen, he focused on her achievements in just this area. \u201cDuring her term,\u201d he said, \u201cFederal Reserve policymakers began to normalise both the level of interest rates and the size of the balance-sheet.\u201d (On March 21st Mr Powell made his own contribution to the effort, as the Fed raised its benchmark rate by 0.25%.)\n\nBut what makes one era the standard by which all others are judged normal or abnormal? Older central bankers cut their teeth during the 1970s and 1980s when giants like Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman, used double-digit interest rates to tame inflation. Younger ones began their professional lives during the 1990s, when Alan Greenspan and his peers manipulated their economies with a deft rate hike here, a cunning cut there.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, policy rates plummeted to near zero, forcing central bankers to experiment with QE, negative interest rates and promises to leave rates at rock-bottom far into the future. Since the crisis, asset accumulation in rich economies, which still continues in the euro area and Japan, swelled central banks\u2019 balance-sheets by trillions of dollars.\n\nThis combination is more than a relic of the financial crisis, however. Rather, it increasingly looks like a persistent feature of the world economy. Across rich countries, central banks\u2019 benchmark interest rates have been only about 2%, on average, over the past 20 years (see chart). The Fed hopes to raise its benchmark policy rate to 3.5% by 2020, according to its most recent projections, clearing that low bar, but with little to spare.\n\nSince rates usually fall by much more than three percentage points during downturns, the Fed\u2019s projections imply that \u201cunconventional\u201d tools such as asset purchases will be needed again in future. For other central banks, normal is even further out of reach. The Bank of England hopes to reach a policy rate of just over 1% by 2021. The ECB is still in the process of weaning its economies off asset purchases, currently set at \u20ac30bn ($37bn) a month. Japan has been living in an abnormal world for roughly a quarter of a century.\n\nAm I bovvered?\n\nAll this makes talk of normalisation perplexing. It might be bravado intended to conceal uncertainty about how to behave\u2014another teenage habit. Or central bankers may be pinning their hopes on global economic conditions returning to something more like supposedly \u201cnormal\u201d periods in the past. But central-bank policy rates are low because interest rates around the world are low. Those rates reflect a world in which economic growth in advanced economies is slower than it was in the post-war decades, in which there is more capital sloshing around than governments or firms can easily put to good use, and in which inflation is very low and stable.\n\nNone of this seems likely to change soon. Slow productivity gains and ageing populations weigh on advanced economies. An unanticipated borrowing binge by America\u2019s government will soak up some global savings. But it has not yet raised yields on long-term Treasury bonds from their historically low levels. In the absence of a sudden and dramatic change in global conditions, central bankers will be forced to abandon plans to normalise policy\u2014hopefully before, but potentially after, raising rates above levels their economies can tolerate.\n\nSome factors pushing down global interest rates, such as slow growth and excess capital, depress the real (ie, adjusted for inflation) rate of interest. Yet the policy rates that central banks control are nominal. Inflation is a wedge between the two. Consequently, higher inflation would create an environment in which central bankers could set policy rates well above zero even as real interest rates stayed at their current lows.\n\nFor just that reason, some economists have proposed a change in central-bank targets. Among their number are former Fed officials, including Narayana Kocherlakota, who has recommended an increase in the central bank\u2019s inflation target, and Ben Bernanke, who prefers a flexible approach that would give central banks the freedom to allow inflation to rise temporarily higher than the current target permits.\n\nEach idea has its merits. Neither could be described as a return to normal. But as the rare self-confident, trend-setting teenager realises, it is possible, and indeed often preferable, to come to your own understanding of what normal means.", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21739161-nickel-could-make-good-substituteprovided-car-batteries-dont-catch-fire-what-if?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-22T16:47:55", "title": "What if China corners the cobalt market?", "text": "COBALT derives its name from Kobold, a mischievous German goblin who, according to legend, lurks underground. For centuries it vexed medieval miners by looking like a valuable ore that subsequently turned into worthless\u2014and sometimes noxious\u2014rubble. Once again it is threatening to cause trouble, this time in the growing market for batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), each of which uses about 10kg of cobalt. The source of mischief is no longer in Germany, though, but in China.\n\nIt is widely known that more than half of the world\u2019s cobalt reserves and production are in one dangerously unstable country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. What is less well known is that four-fifths of the cobalt sulphates and oxides used to make the all-important cathodes for lithium-ion batteries are refined in China. (Much of the other 20% is processed in Finland, but its raw material, too, comes from a mine in Congo, majority-owned by a Chinese firm, China Molybdenum.)\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 14th concerns about China\u2019s grip on Congo\u2019s cobalt production deepened when GEM, a Chinese battery maker, said it would acquire a third of the cobalt shipped by Glencore, the world\u2019s biggest producer of the metal, between 2018 and 2020\u2014equivalent to almost half of the world\u2019s 110,000-tonne production in 2017. This is likely to add momentum to a rally that has pushed the price of cobalt up from an average of $26,500 a tonne in 2016 to above $90,000 a tonne.\n\nIt is not known whether non-Chinese battery, EV or consumer-electronics manufacturers have done similar, unannounced deals with Glencore. But Sam Jaffe of Cairn Energy Research Advisors, a consultancy, says it will be a severe blow to some firms. He likens the outcome of the deal to a game of musical chairs in which Chinese battery manufacturers have taken all but one of the seats. \u201cEverybody else is frantically looking for that last empty chair.\u201d\n\nMr Jaffe doubts the cobalt grab is an effort by Chinese firms to corner or manipulate the market for speculative ends. Instead, he says, they are likely to be driven by a \u201cdesperate need\u201d to fulfil China\u2019s ambitious plans to step up production of EVs.\n\nOthers see it more ominously. George Heppel of CRU, a consultancy, says that, in addition to GEM sweeping up such a sizeable chunk of Glencore\u2019s output, China Moly may eventually ship its Congo cobalt home rather than to Finland, giving China as much as 95% of the cobalt-chemicals market. \u201cA lot of our clients are South Korean and Japanese tech firms and it\u2019s a big concern of theirs that so much of the world\u2019s cobalt sulphate comes from China.\u201d Memories are still fresh of a maritime squabble in 2010, during which China restricted exports of rare-earth metals vital to Japanese tech firms. China produces about 85% of the world\u2019s rare earths.\n\nFew analysts expect the cobalt market to soften soon. Production in Congo is likely to increase in the next few years, but some investment may be deterred by a recent five-fold leap in royalties on cobalt. Investment elsewhere is limited because cobalt is almost always mined alongside copper or nickel. Even at current prices, the quantities needed are not enough to justify production for cobalt alone.\n\nBut demand could explode if EVs surge in popularity. Mr Heppel says that, though most cobalt is currently mined for batteries in smartphones and for superalloys inside jet engines (see chart), its use for EVs could jump from 9,000 tonnes in 2017 to 107,000 tonnes in 2026.\n\nThe resulting higher prices would eventually unlock new sources of supply. But already non-Chinese battery manufacturers are looking for ways to protect themselves from potential shortages. Their best answer to date is the other \u201cgoblin metal\u201d closely associated with cobalt, nickel, whose name comes from a German spirit closely related to Old Nick.\n\nThe materials most commonly used for cathodes in EV batteries are a combination of nickel, manganese and cobalt known as NMC, and one of nickel, cobalt and aluminium known as NCA. As cobalt has become pricier and scarcer, some battery makers have produced cobalt-lite cathodes by raising the nickel content\u2014to as much as eight times the amount of cobalt. This allows the battery to run longer on a single charge, but makes it harder to manufacture and more prone to burst into flames. The trick is to get the balance right.\n\nStrangely, nickel has not had anything like cobalt\u2019s price rise. Nor do the Chinese appear to covet it. Oliver Ramsbottom of McKinsey, a consultancy, says the reason for this relative indifference dates back to the commodities supercycle in 2000-12, when Indonesia and the Philippines ramped up production of class-2 nickel\u2014in particular nickel pig iron, a lower-cost ingredient of stainless steel\u2014until the bubble burst. The subsequent excess capacity and stock build-up caused nickel prices to plummet from $29,000 a tonne in 2011 to below $10,000 a tonne last year.\n\nAs yet, the demand for high-quality nickel suitable for EVs has not boosted production. Output of Class-1 nickel for EVs was only 35,000 tonnes last year, out of total nickel production of 2.1m tonnes. But by 2025 McKinsey expects EV-related nickel demand to rise 16-fold to 550,000 tonnes.\n\nIn theory, the best way to ensure sufficient supplies of both nickel and cobalt would be for prices to rise enough to make mining them together more profitable. But that would mean more expensive batteries, and thus electric vehicles.

The eastern European country had been a glaring hole in the airline\u2019s route network, deliberately avoided because of the anti-competitive advantages afforded to Ukraine International Airlines (UIA), the flag carrier based in Kiev, the capital city. A new infrastructure minister, Volodymyr Omelyan, brokered the deal between Ryanair and Boryspil Airport, Kiev\u2019s main gateway and home base of UIA. But it collapsed within months. Now, Ryanair, the government and the airport are trying again.\n\nOn March 23rd Ryanair announced that it will launch ten routes to Kiev and five to Lviv in October. The most recent move marks a scaling up of Ryanair\u2019s original plan. The airline never lost interest in serving Ukraine, but said its business confidence was \u201cdented by the Kiev experience\u201d. As Gulliver previously reported, that experience comprised of Boryspil Airport amending its contract at the eleventh hour, UIA filing lawsuits to block the low-cost carrier\u2019s entry, and both companies\u2019 management denigrating Ryanair in the local press. \u201cIt was sabotaged and unfortunately it was done in a very rude way,\u201d Mr Omelyan recalled at the time.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUIA\u2019s opposition to Ryanair was entirely understandable. The flag carrier is owned by Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch who has near total control of the country\u2019s aviation sector. Opening the market to low-cost competition will take money directly out of Mr Kolomoisky\u2019s pockets. But Boryspil Airport\u2019s opposition was more perplexing. Its boss, Pavlo Riabikin, claimed that the discounted user charges promised to Ryanair would cost his airport money.\n\nYet the success of Ryanair\u2019s business model elsewhere in Europe suggests otherwise. Its demand-catalysing low fares have been shown to create widespread benefits: for passengers, who can travel more freely, for governments, whose economies grow more rapidly, and for airports, whose retail shops, restaurants and car parks bustle with activity. Mr Omelyan directly accused Mr Riabikin of pandering to UIA, his main customer, at the expense of the country. He called for the airport boss to go, insisting: \u201cYou can\u2019t make good reform with bad people.\u201d\n\nWhat has changed this time around? Nothing has shifted at the top level of Boryspil Airport\u2019s management structure. Mr Riabikin, who remains in charge of the facility, was sitting side by side with Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, as the new deal was signed. But the political pressure on him has ramped up markedly. Last time, Mr Riabikin and Mr Omelyan gave differing accounts of the commitments and objections voiced by Boryspil Airport when the deal was inked. This time, Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine\u2019s president, stood beside the airport boss as he put pen to paper. Another change of heart by the airport would not simply be an affront to the infrastructure ministry, it would be a public act of defiance against the country\u2019s top leaders. Even close friends of oligarchs cannot get away with that.\n\nLocal media reports also claim that a new system for incentivising and rewarding passenger growth is being implemented\u2013not just with Ryanair, but with all airlines at the airport. If true, this means that airport fees will only be discounted when airlines can quantify the net benefit of their presence. That should assuage Mr Riabikin\u2019s purported concerns about Ryanair costing the airport money, as well as giving UIA the opportunity to expand on equal terms.\n\nInforming its readers about Ryanair\u2019s return to Kiev, the Sun, a British tabloid, described the city as a \u201cstag-do favourite with beds from \u00a33 a night and beers as low as 50p\u201d. That is well and good. Budget holidaymakers of all stripes will find a warm welcome in Ukraine. But liberalising air travel with Europe serves a higher purpose too. At present, barely 5% of Ukrainians can afford the luxury of flying. Cheaper tickets with Ryanair will not only enable more of them to take to the skies, it will also tie the country closer to the EU, where all the new routes go.

Godzilla, after all, is usually subdued by the end of the film. The recent announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports has been followed by a wide list of exemptions including the EU. President Trump's strategy seems to be to threaten and then to withdraw those threats in return for small concessions from the other side. That way, he gets kudos from his political base without causing any economic damage.\n\nOn the other side of the Pacific, Elsa Lignos of the Royal Bank of Canada says that \"China will opt to under- rather than over-react.\" Capital Economics, a consultancy, says the damage to the Chinese economy from the tariffs will be only 0.1% of GDP.\n\nBut that was not the only thing President Trump did yesterday. He appointed John Bolton as his third national security adviser in 14 months. Mr Bolton, a noted hawk, argued the case for a first strike on North Korea less than four weeks ago. Ms Lignos views this appointment as \"a more rational concern\" than a trade war. Citigroup concludes that, together with the tariffs, \"These developments unambiguously raise short-term market risks.\"\n\nBluster or not, investors are understandably concerned. Just two months ago, virtually none of the fund managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch picked a trade war as the main market risk; in the latest survey, it tops the polls at 30%.

But they should worry about the very high valuation of the American stockmarket. And they should be concerned about the apparent end goal of Trump's strategy - eliminating the trade deficit. The recent tax cuts will widen, not reduce it, as the US sucks in more imports; tariffs will make little difference. The most likely route for eliminating the deficit wouild be a recession in which the US lost its appetite for imports; not something markets (let alone the voters) would welcome.\n\nNor should they generally welcome a situation where President Trump's tactics are deemed to be successful.

European officials this week unveiled plans for a quick and dirty tax policy to apply to big digital firms, in theory by the end of the year. The idea, promised since September, would ditch a tradition of taxing profits and instead let collectors in member states take a share, 3% for starters, of the firms\u2019 local revenues. There is a lively debate about where exactly the tech giants create taxable value. Is it where their programmers sit? Or the intellectual property? Or users? The firms have become so adept at tax avoidance that the European Commission is not going to hang around until the argument is settled.\n\nPierre Moscovici, the commissioner overseeing the proposals, was at pains to say on March 21st that the turnover tax would be an \u201cinterim\u201d fix. He denied Americans are his targets. Between 120 and 150 companies would be affected, around half of them American and a third European.

Regulators say that this practice helps explain why digital firms pay an estimated effective tax rate in Europe of just 9.5%, compared with 23.3% for bricks-and-mortar ones. The new tax could raise \u20ac5bn a year.\n\nFrance under President Emmanuel Macron has pushed hardest for the plan. But it hardly signals \u201cthe right environment for modern business\u201d that Mr Moscovici brags about. Tax on revenues could backfire\u2014it is unclear what a loss-making firm with whopping turnover is supposed to do, for example. Nor will the proposal easily become reality: tax changes in the EU require unanimity. France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain welcomed the plans. But they will have to strong-arm smaller, low-tax countries, which have most to lose. America, unsurprisingly, is also opposed. Steve Mnuchin, its treasury secretary, told the New York Times this week that gross taxes on internet companies are \u201cnot fair\u201d.\n\nWhy push a reform that might hobble the sort of digital economy European officials call the future? Enter Hobson: doing so makes another proposal, announced by Mr Moscovici on the same day, look more appealing. His preferred outcome is for firms to pay taxes locally on a share of their digital profits, not revenues. To make that possible he says countries should pass laws to identify companies\u2019 \u201cdigital presence\u201d. This would be defined as having online revenues worth \u20ac7m or more, 100,000 customers or more than 3,000 business contracts in any given country. The EU is fuzzier on how to determine what share of profits derives from these revenues.\n\nThat may be fleshed out by various obscurely named efforts to draw up global standards for taxing profits.

Long office hours are seen a proxy for hard work, itself regarded as the cornerstone of Japan\u2019s post-war economic boom. Companies offer to look after employees for life in return for a willingness to dedicate that life to the company, including \u201cservice\u201d (ie, unpaid) overtime or moving house on demand.

The Diet (parliament) is debating a bill which would cap monthly overtime at 100 hours.\n\nThe government hopes that relaxing the work culture will boost productivity (where Japan underperforms the OECD, a club of rich nations) and maybe even combat deflation (it has pushed the idea of freeing workers at 3pm on some Fridays so they can go shopping). Businesses, for their part, are under pressure to attract employees, especially women, amid a severe labour shortage at home.\n\nSome big names are changing their ways. An employee at the national broadcaster, NHK, notorious for all-nighters, says hours have got better and that bosses are nervous about overloading staff.

He has launched the process of lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes, approved self-testing kits for breast-cancer genes and waved through the most new medicines in two decades, as well as a record number of copycat drugs (see article). There is one thing he and his regulatory agency are doing less of, however\u2014regulating. New rules were at a 20-year low in 2017, according to analysts at PwC, a consultancy. Instead, the FDA is providing more guidance to industry. This approach, Mr Gottlieb hopes, will help pharmaceutical firms in America develop drugs more efficiently. Since that is where most drug development happens, the FDA\u2019s philosophy matters beyond American borders.\n\nGiven the rapid pace of scientific advances in medicine, you might think Big Pharma is in rude health. You would be wrong. Last year consultants at Deloitte estimated that returns on investment among the biggest American drugmakers fell to 3.2%, from 10.1% in 2010 (see chart). Many observers blame the rising cost of bringing new drugs to market.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt now costs an average of $2bn to develop a new drug, up from $1.2bn in 2010. One theory is that the easier discoveries have already been made. As medicines become more personalised, the returns per drug may be squeezed because fixed development costs are spread across a smaller pool of potential patients. Either way, firms may have fewer incentives to innovate.\n\nMr Gottlieb has several ideas for how to provide them with more. First, he wants the agency to rethink how much information the FDA demands at an early stage. For example, with better models of a drug\u2019s toxicity, it could be tested in animals later in the process rather than at the outset. Lowering upfront costs should encourage investment, especially by smaller biotech firms with bright ideas but fewer resources. Making early failure cheaper should also enable startups to raise capital more easily.\n\nMr Gottlieb\u2019s second idea is to extend to other areas the innovative trial design that the FDA has pioneered in recent years for cancer drugs. This may involve doing away with the traditional hard boundaries of the drug-testing process (known as phases 1, 2 and 3). Instead, trials constantly adapt by expanding and shrinking cohorts of patients depending on their response to treatment. This makes the process more efficient. The agency is also open to the inclusion of non-trial data (from wearables or patient records, say).\n\nCrucially, some cancer drugs do not now need to show that they extend overall survival, merely that they prolong the time a patient lives without the cancer getting worse. As a benchmark of clinical success, this \u201cendpoint\u201d is quicker, and cheaper, to prove. It may have encouraged investment and innovation in oncology.\n\nThe FDA now wants to do something similar for other diseases, in particular Alzheimer\u2019s. This is Mr Gottlieb\u2019s third idea\u2014and potentially the most controversial.\n\nDementia is an area of growing concern as populations age, but one where drugmakers have a history of costly failures. Since 2003 more than 200 compounds for dementia have entered phase-2 clinical trials, when drugmakers begin testing efficacy. None has yet passed the final phase 3 trial by showing that it actually slows cognitive decline and preserves the ability to perform everyday functions. Over the years the field has proved so costly that AstraZeneca and GSK have cut back research; Pfizer has bowed out entirely.\n\nTo counter this trend, the FDA is weighing whether to approve dementia drugs based on their effect on biomarkers: signatures of genes or proteins that imply the presence and severity of a disease. For Alzheimer\u2019s, this is a lower hurdle than the current cognitive-function endpoints. But biomarkers are not the same as symptoms, so the risk is that costly new drugs will be approved that do not actually work. Avastin (bevacizumab), which was approved for breast cancer using alternative endpoints, turned out to be ineffective.\n\nA few duds may be worth the risk if overall more good medicines reach patients. Pharma firms certainly think so. They have welcomed Mr Gottlieb and his ideas with \u201calmost uniform pleasure and happiness\u201d, says John Maraganore, the boss of a biotech company called Alnylam who also chairs BIO, an industry group.\n\nThat is unsurprising\u2014lower development costs should mean higher returns. What is less clear how much these savings will help the industry\u2019s giants, whose research-and-development efforts are spread thinly across many fields, without deeper changes to their business models.\n\nEven today inexpensive drug development is perfectly possible. If you understand the biology and can identify the patients who will benefit from your drug, Mr Gottlieb says, trials can already be shorter and cheaper. Midsized and biggish bio-pharma firms, for instance, have done far better than the very largest ones. According to Deloitte, biotech companies such as Celgene, Gilead, AbbVie and Biogen enjoyed returns of around 12% last year. Many of them have already benefited from past efforts by the FDA to lubricate the approval of potential breakthrough drugs for cancer and some other diseases. But they are also much less diversified than the likes of Pfizer or GSK. It may be that this narrower focus makes them more efficient.\n\nIt therefore remains to be seen if Mr Gottlieb\u2019s approach can improve efficiency and innovation across the industry. His tenure may be judged a success if he manages to slow their decline. The rest is up to the industry itself.", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/business/21739177-copycat-medicines-may-no-longer-be-enough-keep-them-healthy-indian-drugmakers-need-new?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-22T16:48:00", "title": "Indian drugmakers need a new prescription", "text": "A SINGLE pill of Abilify, a drug used to treat manic depression, costs $30 or so in America. Or you could try gAbilify (the g stands for \u201cgeneric\u201d), better known to chemists as Aripiprazole. Thrifty pharmaceutical companies, many of them in India, can provide it for less than $1 a pop since the drug\u2019s patent expired in 2015. That is bad news for Otsuka and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the two labs that formulated Abilify and got it approved by authorities in the 1990s. Everyone else, from patients to insurers to the public purse, is correspondingly better off. Generics-makers have thrived, particularly in India. But the prognosis for the industry is less rosy.\n\nIndia became the world\u2019s biggest exporter of generics almost by accident. Lax intellectual-property rules in the 1980s allowed its firms to crib drugs patented elsewhere for its huge domestic market. Trade deals gradually opened markets abroad. As patents for a wave of drugs from the 1980s expired two decades later, sales of Indian generics surged.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir off-brand pills, vaccines, patches and syrups help contain health-care costs in rich countries and supply poor ones with once-unaffordable drugs to combat AIDS and other scourges. Firms like Cipla, Sun Pharmaceutical, Lupin and Dr Reddy\u2019s have become pharma\u2019s quiet titans. Indian pharma companies sold $29.6bn-worth of pills and potions in 2017.\n\nAmerica accounts for two-fifths of that. Sales there have grown by 30% a year for the past decade. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which licenses medicines, has embraced generics and made rapid approval easier for copycat drugs. Nearly 550 labs in India supply the lucrative American market, which is now 90% generic by volume. From virtually nothing at the start of the century, around a billion prescriptions made out by American doctors every year are fulfilled with drugs from companies based in India.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s approval came with conditions attached, however. Notably, these included site visits carried out by its dozen-plus inspectors in India. Several plants have flunked these because of poor hygiene or deficient processes, such as a failure to keep track of manufacturing glitches. A giant factory in Halol owned by Sun Pharmaceutical, the biggest Indian firm, has been unable to export new drugs to America since 2015.\n\nThe FDA also wants to see more competition in generics. The agency is licensing ever more foreign drugs and labs\u2014including Chinese ones\u2014for imports to America, undercutting Indian incumbents. It wants to see multiple generics approved for each medicine, to limit pricing power. Wholesalers, distributors and retailers of drugs in America (such as hospitals and pharmacies) have merged or ganged up in consortia to help contain rising drug costs.\n\nThe side-effects are already showing in India. Indian companies\u2019 sales of generic drugs have been flat for the past two years, and profits in the most recent quarter were down by a third compared with a year ago. Analysts expect profits from America to erode by around 10% annually. Prosecutors in 45 American states suspect that price-fixing helped to fatten margins earlier this decade. That could result in large fines for guilty firms. As easy-to-copy blockbuster drugs become rarer, moreover, manufacturers of copycats may see their lifeblood threatened. An index of Indian pharma companies has fallen by a quarter in two years, at a time when the broader market grew by 40%.\n\nThere is no obvious cure. Prospects for growth in other markets look mixed. Europe and Japan are less keen on generics than America, for now. Patients in poor countries are popping more pills as their incomes rise. But regulators there have a tendency to cap prices\u2014a phenomenon which has crimped Indian pharma at home for years.\n\nIn response to these pressures, Indian firms have turned to more intricate products, such as patches and inhalers, as well as to more complex drugs. These are trickier to develop but offer better margins. Research-and-development costs have crept up as a result, although the top seven labs in India jointly spend around $1.5bn a year on innovation\u2014about a fifth of what a large Western pharmaceutical company splashes out.\n\nMore dramatic treatment may be in order. Consolidation has helped generics giants elsewhere to cut costs. Teva, based in Israel, and Mylan, an American company, both slashed their workforce after recent takeovers. But Indian firms, though listed, are still controlled by their founders. Many are run as family businesses, which tend to be averse to mergers.\n\nThe industry\u2019s panjandrums insist that a new culture of compliance will make FDA site closures a thing of the past.

Dropbox gives away a basic level of storage for nothing but charges for premium services, including pricier business subscriptions. In order to increase revenues, it either needs to convert more users into paying ones, or encourage existing subscribers to upgrade. So far only 2% of users pay anything, and average revenue per paying user is flat. In 2017 it posted a loss of over $110m. The firm is counting on a shift away from individual users and towards firms to deliver profits.\n\nIt will have to do battle with the giants. Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft all now offer either consumer or enterprise storage services. They bundle together a wider range of offerings than Dropbox can. Jobs\u2019s reported description of the firm as a \u201cfeature, not a product\u201d might not have been sour grapes. If the behemoths were to slash prices for storage, Dropbox\u2019s margins would be squeezed.\n\nThat said, the firm has enough going for it to keep investors interested. It is not losing out to rivals yet; revenues grew by a third last year. The market for the management of corporate information is wide open, says Terry Frazier from IDC, a market-research firm. Most businesses have yet to make the leap from storing data on their premises to the cloud. An agreement with Salesforce, which offers corporate online services and is buying $100m of its shares, could give Dropbox a shop window for new business customers. And if Dropbox manages to acquire some of them, the cost of moving data to other platforms means they could stay loyal for some time.

Each death is a tragedy, but that of Elaine Herzberg, who died after being hit by a car in Tempe, Arizona on the evening of March 18th, was a tragedy of a new kind. It was the first known case of a pedestrian being killed by a self-driving car. The accident has raised questions about whether America\u2019s rules surrounding the testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are too lax.\n\nThe vehicle that struck Ms Herzberg was being tested in \u201cautonomous mode\u201d by Uber, a ride-hailing firm. Local police say it was travelling at 38mph (61kph) on a road with a speed limit of 45mph, and that video from the vehicle shows Ms Herzberg, who was wheeling a bicycle by the side of the road, stepping suddenly into the car\u2019s path. A human safety driver in the vehicle did not anticipate the collision and had not taken manual control. The police and federal safety bodies have launched investigations, during which Uber has suspended operation of its AVs in Arizona, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany American cities and states permit the testing of AVs on public roads, with varying degrees of licensing and oversight. Boston, for example, requires AVs to pass a driving test in a limited area before heading out into the wider city. California requires companies testing AVs to provide annual safety reports. Arizona is a particularly attractive environment for AV-makers, because its streets are regular grids, the weather is reliably dry and warm (snow can confuse the LIDAR sensors AVs use to scan their surroundings) and its regulators have been unusually welcoming. Since 2015, no special permits or licences have been needed to operate AVs in Arizona, though the governor announced a tweaking of the rules on March 1st.\n\nThose new rules will now come under intense scrutiny, as will legislation, currently in the works in Washington, DC, to introduce federal safety standards for AV testing. This proposes exempting AVs from some existing safety standards, and would prevent states from introducing their own rules for AVs. The aim is to spur innovation by simplifying the regulatory environment. But in the wake of the accident in Tempe, road-safety advocates have called for the rules around AVs to be tightened, not loosened. Boston has asked nuTonomy, an AV firm, to suspend testing. Toyota said it would have a voluntary pause in the testing of AVs on American roads. The firm said it was concerned about the emotional effect of the Tempe accident on its safety drivers.\n\nProponents of AVs often cite the safety benefits of vehicles that can drive themselves, noting that 94% of accidents are caused by human error. General Motors, America\u2019s biggest carmaker, has set a goal of \u201czero crashes\u201d. But developing the technology means testing it on public roads, where accidents involving AVs and other road users are inevitable. AVs will never eliminate road deaths, and expecting them to do so is to hold them to an impossible standard. A more realistic goal, suggests Amnon Shashua of Mobileye, a maker of AV technology, is to reduce the number of road deaths a thousandfold. But in a paper published last year, he warned of the danger of a \u201cwinter of autonomous driving\u201d, suggesting that because of regulatory uncertainty, fatal accidents involving fully autonomous vehicles could plunge the industry into legal limbo, or kill it altogether.\n\nThe extent to which Ms Herzberg\u2019s death will change attitudes towards AVs, or influence the regulation of the industry, depends to a large extent on the findings of the various investigations. It is important to avoid unnecessary risks when developing and implementing what promises to be a life-saving technology. But the sad truth is that there are bound to be fatal accidents on the road to a driverless world.", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21739146-helps-search-extraterrestrial-life-saturns-rings-and-several-its?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-22T16:47:55", "title": "Saturn\u2019s rings and several of its moons may be recent creations", "text": "NOT everything looks lovelier the longer and closer its inspection. But Saturn does. It is gorgeous through Earthly telescopes. However, the 13 years of close observation provided by Cassini, an American spacecraft, showed the planet, its moons and its remarkable rings off better and better, revealing finer structures, striking novelties and greater drama.\n\nCassini\u2019s observations, which ended last September when the craft was crashed into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, also provided further evidence that, as might be expected of such delicate beauty, the rings are quite new to the world. This idea is not novel, but has been put on a firmer footing than before. And a new theory proposes that the cataclysm which created the rings may also have brought into being quite a few of Saturn\u2019s moons.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy and large the big things in the solar system\u2014planets and moons\u2014are thought of as having been around since the beginning. The suggestion that rings and moons are new is, though, made even more interesting by the fact that one of those moons, Enceladus, is widely considered the most promising site in the solar system on which to look for alien life. If Enceladus is both young and bears life, that life must have come into being quickly. This is also believed to have been the case on Earth. Were it true on Enceladus, that would encourage the idea that life evolves easily when conditions are right.\n\nOne reason for thinking Saturn\u2019s rings are young is that they are bright. The solar system is suffused with comet dust, and comet dust is dark. Leaving Saturn\u2019s ring system (which Cassini has shown to be more than 90% water ice) out in such a mist is like leaving laundry hanging on a line downwind from a smokestack: it will get dirty. The lighter the rings are, the faster this will happen, for the less mass they contain, the less celestial pollution they can absorb before they start to discolour. And, though the final figures have yet to be published, on March 19th Jeff Cuzzi, a scientist at America\u2019s space agency, NASA, who helped run Cassini, told the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston that combining the mass estimates with Cassini\u2019s measurements of the density of comet-dust near Saturn suggests the rings are no older than the first dinosaurs, nor younger than the last of them\u2014that is, they are somewhere between 200m and 70m years old.\n\nThat timing fits well with a theory put forward in 2016, by Matija Cuk of the SETI Institute, in California and his colleagues. They suggest that at around the same time as the rings came into being an old set of moons orbiting Saturn destroyed themselves, and from their remains emerged not only the rings but also the planet\u2019s current suite of inner moons\u2014Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus and Mimas. (Tethys and Enceladus are pictured, along with the rings.)\n\nDr Cuk and his colleagues used computer simulations of Saturn\u2019s moons\u2019 orbits as a sort of time machine. Looking at the rate at which tidal friction is causing these orbits to lengthen they extrapolated backwards to find out what those orbits would have looked like in the past. They discovered that about 100m years ago the orbits of two of them, Tethys and Dione, would have interacted in a way that left the planes in which they orbit markedly tilted. But their orbits are untilted. The obvious, if unsettling, conclusion was that this interaction never happened\u2014and thus that at the time when it should have happened, Dione and Tethys were simply not there. They must have come into being later.\n\nThe first blush of youth\n\nHow could this be? Dr Cuk\u2019s explanation relies on another form of orbital perturbation called an evection. Orbits have a property called precession. The point at which a moon and its planet come closest together, known as periapsis, is not constant. On each of a moon\u2019s orbits, periapsis shifts a little farther around the planet until it eventually returns to where it was. When the period of this precession matches the time it takes the planet itself to orbit the sun, the sun\u2019s gravity will distort the moon\u2019s orbit. This is evection.\n\nDr Cuk and his colleagues think that Saturn started off with two moons close to it that, between them, weighed a bit more than Dione and Rhea, the biggest of today\u2019s inner moons. Their orbits would have expanded slowly for billions of years until the radius of the more distant one\u2019s orbit was 8.3 times that of Saturn\u2014at which point it would have entered a powerful evection and started swinging around like a wild thing. Eventually it would have smacked into its sibling, destroying both and creating a vast disc of debris. Reasonably quickly, gravity would have clumped almost all of this debris back together, to produce a new set of moons. These are the ones seen today. But within a certain orbital radius, known as the Roche limit, moons cannot form. There, the disc would have remained a disc\u2014the disc of the rings.\n\nIf Dr Cuk\u2019s theory is correct, it makes Enceladus even more interesting. One of Cassini\u2019s most provocative discoveries was that Enceladus has an ocean under its icy exterior, plumes from which are sprayed into space on a regular basis from rifts in the ice at its south pole. Cassini showed that this ocean contains hydrothermal sites which could provide chemical energy, and that there are organic molecules in it.\n\nMany believe that the presence of these things was all that was required for life to get started on Earth. Now, Enceladus looks as youthful as Earth was then. Old enough for life to have begun. Young enough for nothing dire to have happened to it.

This is bad for research and for the public.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, as Facebook finds itself in the throes of a scandal over its handling of data and the power of its hyper-targeted advertising software, Dr Mislove is working with a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who think they have an answer to these problems. This group, based at MIT's Media Lab and led by Iyad Rahwan, has taken a leaf out of the book of B.F. Skinner, an animal behaviourist who, several decades ago, worked down the road from MIT at Harvard. Skinner invented a device, now known as a Skinner box, which standardised the process of behavioural experimentation. He used his boxes to control input stimuli (food, light, sound, pain) and then observed output behaviour in an attempt to link the one to the other. Though by no means perfect, the Skinner box was a big advance in the field. Dr Rahwan hopes to do something similar to software using what he calls a Turing box.\n\nThis \u201cbox\u201d is itself a piece of software. Place an algorithm in it, control the data inputs, measure the outcomes, and you will be able to work out exactly how it behaves in different circumstances. Anyone who wants to study an algorithm could upload it to a Turing box. The box\u2019s software would then start running the algorithm through a standard data set of the kind it was designed to crunch. All face-recognition algorithms, for example, would be given the same scientifically validated set of faces. The algorithm\u2019s output\u2014in this case how it classifies different faces\u2014would be recorded and analysed. Dr Rahwan\u2019s hope is that companies will want political and social scientists to use the box to scrutinise their algorithms for potentially harmful flaws (eg, treating faces differently on racial grounds), and that researchers will line up to do the testing.\n\nIndeed, his ambitions go further still. His intention is that the Turing box should become just one component of a new field, the scientific study of the behaviour exhibited by intelligent machines, and of the impact of that behaviour on people. A demonstration paper he and his colleagues have submitted for publication to the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence describes the system, as well as the broader details of this new field of machine behaviour. He plans to finish the Turing-box software by the summer, and says he will publish the code under an open-source licence shortly thereafter, for anyone to reuse. The running of the platform will then be left to a not-for-profit firm that he plans to spin out of MIT.\n\nBoxing clever\n\nIt is a neat idea, and timely. Algorithms are being developed far faster than their impacts are being studied and understood (see chart). The Turing box, if it works as intended, could help turn the tide. Understanding algorithms\u2019 behaviour is particularly urgent in the existing digital-advertising \u201cecosystem\u201d, in which individual users of software are, in effect, in their own Skinner boxes\u2014with their actions constantly monitored, and tailored rewards fed to them. The Facebook furore, for example, revolves around allegations that Cambridge Analytica, a digital lobbying firm, improperly obtained data from Facebook, then used them to aim advertisements which influenced the American presidential election in 2016 (the firm has denied any wrongdoing).\n\nDr Rahwan recognises that the reluctance of many companies which form part of the digital-advertising ecosystem to upload their algorithms for inspection make it a bad place to start. So, to begin with, he will work elsewhere, studying less controversial and commercially sensitive systems such as open-source algorithms for processing natural language.\n\nHe says, though, that the ultimate goal is to enable the study of the algorithms which some of the world\u2019s most valuable IT firms hold dearest: Facebook\u2019s newsfeed, for example, or Amazon\u2019s product-recommendation software. That means looking at the behaviour of these algorithms in an environment which is as close as possible to that in which they normally operate, so that their impact on the real world can be measured. This in turn will require the firms that own them giving independent researchers access to their systems and data.\n\nRecent years have seen things go in the opposite direction. According to Michal Kosinski of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, who in 2012 pioneered the use of Facebook data to study personality, \u201cacademic researchers have virtually no access even to publicly available data without breaking a given platform\u2019s terms of service.\u201d Firms\u2019 scruples in these matters are not driven only by desire for commercial secrecy. As this week\u2019s events have shown, a leak of personal data from an academic inquiry can be just as damaging as one from a sloppy business partner.\n\nSo, research on particularly sensitive data may require academics to be physically present inside an organisation in order to gain access to those data, a process akin to studying in the rare-books section of a library. It might also be a good idea to have independent umpires of some sort, to ensure that both firms and researchers stay on the straight and narrow.\n\nFacebook seems open to the idea of working with researchers in this way. In a statement given to The Economist a few days before the Cambridge Analytica story broke, the firm stated a desire to work with researchers in order to understand the impact of its systems, but warned that it had to shield its users\u2019 data from third parties. Facebook also said that it is \u201cactively working\u201d on an approach which achieves both goals, although it declined to provide any details of that work. Contacted later in the week, the firm\u2019s data-science team declined to issue any additional statement.\n\nThe Turing box is only in the earliest stages of development, but it, and systems like it, offer to inject something vital into the discussion of digital practices\u2014independently gathered causal evidence.

But they brought only one such tame companion with them when they first crossed from Siberia to Alaska. This was the dog. And, though genetic studies show that most modern dogs in the Americas are descended from post-Columbian European imports, a few breeds preserve their ancient ancestry.\n\nThese relics include Chihuahuas, from Mexico and Central America. Chihuahua-like skeletons have been found in many Mesoamerican archaeological sites. But what role these tiny dogs played in pre-Columbian society has been unclear. It is a little less unclear now, though, thanks to a study just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Ashley Sharpe of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. In it Dr Sharpe shows that the Maya, a Mesoamerican people who flourished between the eighth century BC and the tenth century AD, traded dogs over long distances, and that these dogs may have been involved in religious ceremonies. The study also hints that the Maya kept big cats\u2014either jaguars or pumas\u2014again for religious purposes.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sharpe came to these conclusions after studying roughly 25,000 animal bones collected in and around Ceibal, an abandoned Maya city in modern-day Guatemala. Most of those bones came from what appear to have been rubbish dumps on the outskirts of the city. Some, however, were found in its ceremonial centre. Altogether, from all sites, she and her colleagues identified bones of white-tailed deer, peccaries, two species of turkey, some large cats (they were unclear whether these were jaguars or pumas), opossum and tapirs. And dogs. As with other Mesoamerican sites, these dogs resembled modern Chihuahuas.\n\nTo find out more about the remains, canine and otherwise, the team subjected 78 of the bones, each from a different skeleton, to two sorts of isotopic analysis. First, they looked at the bones\u2019 carbon composition. Most carbon atoms have 12 neutrons in their nuclei, but about 1% sport a thirteenth. In plants, the ratio of 12C to 13C depends on which of two forms of photosynthesis (C3 or C4) the plant employs. C4 plants have more 13C than do C3 ones. This ratio is then passed on to animals that eat the plants in question, making it possible to guess those animals\u2019 diets from molecules in their remains.\n\nIn the wild, only about 5% of plants use C4, but that is not true of crops. In particular, maize, the main cereal in pre-Columbian America, employs C4 photosynthesis. Pre-Columbian people therefore had bones enriched in 13C. And so, Dr Sharpe discovered, did the dogs at Ceibal. All 26 of the dog specimens she analysed had 13C values double those found in the deer, the peccaries, the tapirs and the opossum.\n\nThat is interesting, but not entirely surprising. It suggests the dogs were eating either maize, or animals fed on maize, or both. This will surely have been true, whether they were pets or feral animals dependent on human refuse. Three of the five turkeys, too, had high 13C values\u2014again, no surprise. Intriguingly, however, one of the big cats had also eaten a lot of 13C. And this cat\u2019s bones had been excavated from the central ceremonial area.\n\nNor is carbon the only element of interest to archaeologists. Strontium fascinates them, too. Like carbon nuclei, those of strontium have two stable isotopes. Unlike carbon, the ratio of these isotopes in living things reflects local geology rather than photosynthesis. Dr Sharpe\u2019s analysis of strontium in the animals\u2019 teeth showed that two of the dogs had not been born and raised locally. One had come from the highlands near what is now Guatemala City, almost 200km away. The other was from a place in the foothills of those highlands, on what other evidence suggests was a trade route from the highlands to Ceibal. And the dogs concerned were both from the ceremonial area.\n\nTo judge by both their provenance and the locations of their skeletons, these dogs were somehow special. And so was the isotopically anomalous big cat, which had clearly been fed on animals (perhaps turkeys) that had, themselves, fed on maize. Maybe all three were just priests\u2019 pets. Or maybe they formed part of some ritual. If that was the case, it is unclear whether they were objects of veneration or sacrifice.

Corals are delicate animals, and are succumbing to pollution and sediment from coastal construction. Also to blame are sewage, farmland run-off and fishing, all of which favour the growth of the big, fleshy algae that are corals\u2019 main competitors for space. (The first two encourage algal growth and the third removes animals that eat those algae.) But the biggest killer is warming seawater. Ocean heatwaves in 2015, 2016 and 2017 finished off an astonishing 20% of the coral on Earth. This is troubling, for countless critters depend on coral reefs for their survival. Indeed, such reefs, which take up just a thousandth of the ocean floor, are home, for at least part of their life cycles, to a quarter of marine species. Losing those reefs would cause huge disruption to the ocean\u2019s ecosystem. So researchers are looking for ways to stop this happening.\n\nOne approach is to lower reef temperatures directly. In December Australia\u2019s environment ministry said it would try doing just that. It has given a charity A$2.2m ($1.7m) to install large, solar-powered rotating blades on parts of the Great Barrier Reef, with the intention of drawing cooler water into that reef.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchemes to cool reefs in this way have, however, been criticised as hopeless at best and possibly even harmful. Colder water can absorb more carbon dioxide, and is therefore likely to be more acidic. That would damage reefs. A growing number of scientists therefore reckon that an entirely different approach to saving coral is needed. If oceans are changing faster than coral can adapt via the normal processes of evolution, why not, these researchers argue, work out ways to speed up such evolution?\n\nLittle breeders\n\nOne way to do this would be selective breeding. Most species of coral spawn on just one or two nights a year, a process regulated by the lunar cycle, the time of sunset and the temperature of the water. The sperm and eggs released during spawning meet and unite, and the results grow into larvae that search for places where they can settle down and metamorphose into the stone-encased sea-anemone-like polyps that are the adult form. In the wild, the meeting of sperm and egg is random. Some researchers, however, are trying to load the dice. By starting with wild specimens that have survived a period of heat which killed their neighbours, they hope to breed heat resistance into the offspring.\n\nThis is the tack taken, for example, by Christian Voolstra of the Red Sea Research Centre in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. He describes it as \u201cmaking sure super papa and super mama meet and reproduce\u201d. Corals bred in this way at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, on Oahu, survive in water that is warm enough to kill offspring resulting from normal, random reproduction.\n\nThe reason corals die when the surrounding water gets too hot is that the microscopic algae and bacteria which live on and in their tissue, and are their main food sources, are sensitive to small changes in temperature. When stressed by heat these symbionts start producing dangerous oxidants. This causes the polyps to eject them, to ensure short-term survival. The reef thus turns ghostly white\u2014a process called bleaching. Bleached coral is not dead. But unless the temperature then drops, the polyps will not readmit the algae and bacteria, and so, eventually, they do die.\n\nPolyps that survive one such ordeal will, however, fare better if temperatures rise again. The second time around they have acclimatised to the change. Some species, indeed, can pass this resilience on to their offspring by a process called intergenerational epigenesis. The Hawaii Institute\u2019s efforts to develop hardier corals thus include administering a near-death experience to them. Ruth Gates, the institute\u2019s director, says the goal is to create reefs \u201cdesigned to withstand the future\u201d. The institute\u2019s first such reef will probably be grown inside Biosphere 2, an enclosed ecosystem run by the University of Arizona.\n\nAnother approach, taken by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in Queensland, is to crossbreed corals from different places, to create hybrid vigour. The results of such crosses are unpredictable, but some survive heat greater than either of their parents could cope with.\n\nThe artificial breeding of corals is, though, constrained by their cyclical breeding habits, so researchers at the Florida Aquarium, on Tampa Bay, are trying to speed the process up. The operators of the aquarium\u2019s \u201ccoral ark\u201d nursery stagger lighting and temperature patterns to fool the animals into releasing their gametes on a day of the researchers\u2019 choosing. This also permits the co-mingling of sperm and eggs that would not normally meet, thus allowing new varieties to be created. According to Scott Graves, the aquarium\u2019s boss, half a dozen such varieties show most promise of heat resistance, but the team is generating thousands more, \u201cjust like a seed bank\u201d, as a backup.\n\nA polyp\u2019s fate is tied so closely to the algae and bacteria which live in its tissues that, as Dr Gates puts it, it is best to think of the whole thing as \u201ca consortium of organisms\u201d. This is why scientists at AIMS are keen also to produce algae that withstand higher temperatures without releasing the oxidants that lead coral to kick them out. They are doing so using a process which Madeleine van Oppen, a researcher at the institute, calls \u201cdirected laboratory evolution\u201d. In the past few years her team have grown more than 80 generations of algae, repeatedly culling those organisms most susceptible to heat stress and also to acidification, another curse of a world with more carbon dioxide around than previously. The resulting algae release fewer toxins and photosynthesise better in warm water than do their wild brethren.\n\nCuriously\u2014and unfortunately\u2014Dr van Oppen\u2019s super-algae seem to lose their newfound prowess once they colonise a coral. Andrew Baker of the University of Miami also noticed this, and is trying to do something about it. After studying the genetic codes of algae that did well in warm waters, his team began injecting those types of algae into the tiny and tentacle-encircled mouths of polyps. As Dr van Oppen\u2019s results would predict, the polyps seemed to benefit little from this artificial inoculation. In follow-up work, however, Dr Baker has found that after the trauma of bleaching, polyps do extend a preferential welcome to algae that have greater levels of heat tolerance. His team are thus now using special lights to bleach corals. Polyps \u201cstress hardened\u201d in this way will be planted on wild reefs in coming months.\n\nCoral larvae swim around a lot before choosing a spot to live. Only when they encounter a suitable place (the local bacteria seem to be the deciding factor) will they settle down and grow into polyps. Kristen Marhaver of CARMABI Research Station in Cura\u00e7ao, a Dutch Caribbean island, is studying this. She is classifying corals\u2019 reactions to myriad types of bacteria, so that \u201cprobiotic\u201d bacterial mixtures which increase larvae settlement and survival can be prepared. Next year her attention will turn to how these probiotics can be applied to coral in the wild\u2014perhaps as a gel.\n\nThe shock of the new\n\nA decade ago, sequencing 1m DNA base pairs cost a few thousand dollars. Today the same money buys 100bn base pairs. The consequent flood of data is helping researchers determine which genes are behind a coral\u2019s, an alga\u2019s or a bacterium\u2019s fragility or resilience. Stephen Palumbi of Stanford University, for example, is identifying coral genes that produce the \u201cheat-shock\u201d proteins which repair damage caused by too much warmth.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the genomes of coral, algae and bacteria might be edited for greater robustness. According to Dr Voolstra, more than ten laboratories around the world are trying to do so. His own team has successfully inserted genetic material into about 30 larvae of a coral called Acropora millepora. Editing corals\u2019 heat thresholds in this way is, he reckons, about five years away.\n\nWhether they are created by selective breeding or genetic engineering, supercorals, the thinking goes, would not need to be placed on reefs in astronomical numbers. If they are truly fit for purpose they will necessarily multiply more rapidly than wild varieties do in the warmer, more acidic seas of the future. That thought, however, does not please everybody. Some object in principle to the idea of releasing human-modified creatures into the wild, or feel that amelioration of this sort is a distraction from the business of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. Others have pragmatic concerns\u2014that corals bred to survive warming seas might suffer handicapping trade-offs. So regulators have been cautious. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, for example, will probably require that the hybrid organisms AIMS hopes to test in the open reef are removed before they begin spawning.\n\nAccording to Dr Voolstra, however, the recent big losses of coral are tipping attitudes towards action\u2014including genetic engineering\u2014if the collapse continues. As to the best course of that action, America\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is paying for a study, begun last month by the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences, to look into the risks and benefits of the various possible approaches. In the view of Jennifer Koss, who runs NOAA\u2019s reef programme, the alternative, of doing nothing, is the equivalent of \u201c just throwing our hands up in the air and saying, \u2018OK, we\u2019re prepared now not to have coral\u2019.\u201d For the world\u2019s oceans, that loss would be catastrophic.", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21738870-no-one-will-be-hurt-probably-out-control-chinese-space-station-will-soon?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-15T16:50:09", "title": "An out-of-control Chinese space station will soon fall to Earth", "text": "ITS name means \u201cheavenly palace\u201d. But Tiangong-1, an eight-tonne Chinese space station launched in 2011, will not remain in the heavens much longer.

A few months later China\u2019s space agency appeared to confirm what amateur skywatchers had already suspected, that it had lost control of the station. It said it expected Tiangong-1 to fall from the sky sometime late in 2017.\n\nIn fact, the station is still up there, orbiting at an average height of 250km. But the inaccuracy of the agency\u2019s prediction is understandable. At low altitudes (anything under about 2,000km), orbital mechanics is a surprisingly imprecise science. Earth\u2019s thin outer atmosphere exerts a measurable drag on anything in such an orbit, and this drag means that, without regular boosts, that object will fall out of orbit eventually. The drag itself, however, is not constant. So exactly when this fiery fall will happen is hard to say in advance.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in the sun\u2019s activity, for example, affect the density of the outer atmosphere, speeding up or slowing down the speed of an orbit\u2019s decay. The interplay between Earth\u2019s magnetic field and the solar wind has similar effects. In the case of Tiangong-1, though, the end is close enough for educated guesses to be made. The Aerospace Corporation, an American consultancy, reckons that April 3rd is the most likely day. The European Space Agency expects it to happen sometime between March 29th and April 9th.\n\nAs space junk goes, Tiangong-1 is big, but not especially so (the spent second stage of a Russian Zenit rocket, which is roughly the same size, re-entered the atmosphere over Peru in January). There is, nevertheless, a good chance that some parts of it will survive their descent.\n\nWithout knowing when the station will fall, it is impossible to say where those pieces might land, though the characteristics of the station\u2019s orbit mean it will be between latitudes 43\u00b0 north (that of northern Spain) and 43\u00b0 south (which passes by Tasmania; see map). Wherever they land, the pieces will come down in a long, narrow line, with the densest parts of the station travelling farthest.\n\nOn the face of it, the chance of any of that debris hitting someone is low. For one thing, the world is mostly ocean. For another, even on land people are small and scarce compared with the available area. Nor, indeed, is anyone known to have been injured by re-entering debris since the space age began (though someone has been hit but not hurt). The risk of such injury cannot, however, be ruled out\u2014and the chance of damage to property, which occupies a larger fraction of Earth\u2019s surface than people do, is proportionately higher.\n\nThe way to eliminate such risks is controlled re-entry. As Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, observes, that is becoming more common. Around 40% of rocket stages that end up in space, he says, can now restart their own engines and alter their orbits. Most satellites bigger than about five tonnes likewise come fitted with motors of their own. That allows their controllers to aim them more precisely when the time comes to dispose of them.\n\nTiangong-1 itself was probably supposed to have been guided into the remote southern Pacific Ocean, the dumping site of choice for superannuated space hardware, in 2013. But, says Dr McDowell, the station was kept on as an insurance plan, in case the launch of its successor, Tiangong-2, failed. In the event, Tiangong-2 reached orbit in 2016 without incident. Tiangong-1, meanwhile, stopped working\u2014leaving its fate in the hands of the space-weather gods rather than its controllers on the ground.", "author": ["The Economist"]}, {"link": "https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21738869-taking-care-bumps-and-potholes-new-type-smooth-car-suspension?fsrc=rss", "published": "2018-03-15T16:50:09", "title": "A new type of smooth car suspension", "text": "WHEN unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1955, the Citro\u00ebn DS caused a sensation. It was not just the car\u2019s elegant lines that encouraged 12,000 customers to place immediate orders, but also its mechanical innovations. Chief among these was that instead of steel springs, the DS rode on a self-levelling hydropneumatic suspension. This used spheres, filled with nitrogen, connected to each wheel. When started, the car\u2019s engine pumped hydraulic fluid into the spheres, lifting the vehicle\u2019s body.

Other, better systems had superseded it. Mr Avadhany now hopes to do to them what they did to Citro\u00ebn, and run them off the road.\n\nWhen he and his colleagues spun ClearMotion out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008, their intention was to use bumps in the road to generate electricity. They had developed a device designed to be attached to the side of a standard shock absorber. As the suspension moved up and down, hydraulic fluid from the absorber would be forced through their device, turning a rotor that generated electricity. But, just as a generator and an electric motor are essentially the same, except that they run in opposite directions, so ClearMotion\u2019s engineers realised that running their bump-powered generator backwards would turn it into an ideal form of suspension. And that seemed a much better line of business. They therefore designed a version in which the rotor is electrically powered and pumps hydraulic fluid rapidly into and out of the shock absorber. The effect is to level out a rough road by pushing the wheels down into dips and pulling them up over bumps.\n\nThis is helped by knowing when the dips and bumps are coming. The system is able to do that by tapping into the increasingly sophisticated network of sensors employed in modern vehicles. Its algorithms use these sensors to learn within millimetres the profile of the road being travelled. They then share the results, via a computing cloud, with other vehicles using the same process. This means that the next time any vehicle in the fleet travels the same route, the system\u2019s software is able to anticipate the road\u2019s topography and control the car\u2019s suspension appropriately.\n\nAccording to Mr Avadhany, ClearMotion is working with a number of parts suppliers and is close to bringing the system to market. He expects it will be particularly useful for autonomous vehicles, in which passengers are likely to want to use their journey time to work or read.

Dated 1865, it features an area of the city known as North Beach, which back then was covered in ramshackle wooden houses on a sandy slope nuzzled up against the shore. Since then, the coastline has been extended, filled in with sand (and most likely boats and other strange things) to stretch several blocks farther into the brackish waters of the San Francisco Bay. A sea wall, badly in need of repair, keeps the bay at bay.\n\nThat very sea wall is at the heart of the court case \u2014 The People of the State of California v. BP P.L.C. et al. \u2014 that was the reason for Wednesday\u2019s spectacle. The cities of Oakland and San Francisco are suing the five biggest fossil fuel companies on the planet \u2014 BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell \u2014 for billions of dollars for past damages and to prevent future flooding from sea level rise. Since the companies extracted fuel that altered the planet, the argument goes, they should pay for the consequences. It\u2019s a modern version of \u201cyou break it, you buy it.\u201d The oil companies have filed to dismiss the lawsuit on many grounds, including that it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to set and enforce carbon dioxide levels \u2014 not theirs.\n\nOn Wednesday, no one was yet on trial. U.S. District Judge William Alsup made that very clear to the throng of spectators who filled the chambers, a spillover courtroom and the halls outside. Instead, we were there to see a tutorial, an effort to help this self-described \u201cpoor judge\u201d learn the science behind the case. It was going to be a boring morning full of numbers and diagrams, he warned the audience.\n\nBut in this polarized moment, a public tussling over the basics of climate science, however cursory, is anything but boring. And as each side in the case presented a history of climate change science, it was striking just how much the two sides agreed on: Climate change is happening, and humans are in large part responsible. But that\u2019s not really what this court case is about. Rather, it\u2019s about who knew what and when, how much uncertainty there is around future predictions and who should be held responsible (and liable) for a future with higher seas and more extreme weather events. That\u2019s where the cities\u2019 and corporations\u2019 use of evidence diverged.\n\nFirst up: the scientists.\n\nAt a big rectangular table in the center of the room, the cities were represented by Steve Berman, a lawyer known for his ability to get big settlements out of big corporations, as well as some of their own lawyers. But aside from a few introductory remarks, Berman left the talking to a few of the world\u2019s leading experts on climate change. First, he called Myles Allen, who is a professor of geosystem science at Oxford University and was tasked with providing a historiography of climate change research.\n\nIn true scientist fashion, the talk was filled with jargon and complicated scientific concepts. Alsup, who made clear that he would call out confusing charts or unclear explanations, asked Allen what made carbon dioxide, which is emitted from burning fossil fuels and have led to a warming planet, special. Allen, equal to the task, began to pantomime his answer. Arms stretched out to the side, fists in a ball, he shimmied left and right, showing how the charge on a carbon dioxide molecule could be unevenly distributed, absorbing the infrared waves that are naturally emitted from Earth, unlike oxygen and nitrogen, whose charge is symmetric. That infrared gets trapped within Earth\u2019s atmosphere, instead of escaping, causing the planet to warm.\n\nAfter walking through key figures and research from the last century of climate science, Allen concluded by saying that we\u2019ve known that the planet was warming since the 1970s. And crucially, he said, we knew back then that we might not know how bad climate change would be, or be able to feel and see the effects of that warming, until it was already too late.\n\nThe next speaker, Gary Griggs, an oceanographer who works at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was deep into an explanation of sea level rise when a loud, piercing alarm went off. \u201cCoastal flood alert,\u201d Alsup quipped as soon as it finished. The room broke out in laughter. It wasn\u2019t clear whether it was real or a drill, but nature has a way of making itself known.\n\nNext up: the lawyers.\n\nWhile the cities relied on scientists, the energy companies relied on lawyers. One in particular: Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for Chevron (which is headquartered in the Bay Area) did all of the talking. And he got straight to the point, answering the question on everyone\u2019s mind: Yes, Chevron accepts the scientific consensus on climate change. And in honor of that consensus, he\u2019d be relying almost entirely on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations-backed consortium meant to provide a scientific view of what climate change is doing to the planet, to lay out his understanding of the science and the history.\n\nHe kicked off by quoting from the IPCC\u2019s most recent report, from 2013, citing population growth and economic changes as the most important drivers of climate change. The report, he noted, says nothing about fossil-fuel extraction as a driver of climate change.\n\nBoutrous offered a history lesson that had a lot in common with Allen\u2019s, but with a much greater focus on the uncertainty around both the science and the impacts of climate change on the Bay Area. He illustrated that uncertainty in various ways, describing how theories that posited alternative roles of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere held sway through at least the 1950s. Boutros also showed how actual temperatures hadn\u2019t been as extreme as many climate forecasts predicted in the years leading up to the report. Alsup asked if his point was that the models exaggerated the impact of humans on the climate. \u201cInstead of doom and gloom, it\u2019s just gloom?\u201d he asked the lawyer. Boutrous chuckled and moved on.\n\nBoutrous concluded by showing a map of sea level rise, saying that sea levels had fallen around San Francisco in the years leading up to the 2013 IPCC report. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about the future, he concluded, noting that San Francisco and Oakland had reported that exact message to bond investors in 2017, when the cities said they couldn\u2019t predict whether major flooding or storms might have a major, adverse impact on the local economy.\n\nFinally, the tutorial pivoted back to the cities, so it pivoted back to the scientists. Don Wuebbles, who is a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and co-wrote the 2007 IPCC report that helped the organization win the Nobel Peace Prize, was the final scientist called by the cities. He began by pointing out that he\u2019d also led the writing of the first chapter in the 2013 IPCC report that Boutrous had so carefully recounted. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize that science did not stop; there\u2019s a lot we\u2019ve learned in the last five years,\u201d Wuebbles said. That\u2019s why he\u2019d be using data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which produces more frequent, national reports on climate change to make his presentation.\n\nThe year after the most recent IPCC report was published was the hottest on record, Wuebbles told the court. Then 2015 topped 2014, and 2016 topped 2015. Temperatures are going up, precipitation is increasing, extreme events are more frequent. Looking at a broader set of years, sea level has risen around the San Francisco Bay. Alsup asked Wuebbles whether he disagreed with Boutrous\u2019s recounting of the science.\n\nNot really, since the lawyer had based his presentation on the IPCC, and a report that Wuebbles was heavily involved with. But Wuebbles\u2019s point was that the IPCC report doesn\u2019t tell all of what we know in 2018. The IPCC report might not be wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it gives the best picture of what\u2019s right.\n\nAs the tutorial concluded, Alsup had a few final remarks. \u201cI wore my science tie today,\u201d he said, pointing to the solar system hanging around his neck before standing up to leave. \u201cI hope someone takes note of that.\u201d", "author": ["Anna Maria Barry-Jester"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/anyone-can-now-take-this-breast-cancer-gene-test-but-it-probably-wont-tell-you-much/", "published": "2018-03-21T17:34:31", "title": "Anyone Can Now Take This Breast Cancer Gene Test, But It Probably Won\u2019t Tell You Much", "text": "Breast and ovarian cancers are scary, anxiety-provoking diseases, and with good reason. Although breast cancer isn\u2019t the cancer that kills the most women (lung cancer holds that distinction), it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. And ovarian cancer is difficult to find in its early stages. But anyone willing to spit in a tube and pay $199 will soon be able to find out if they have a particular genetic predisposition to either of these cancers.\n\nThis month, the FDA granted the genetics company 23andMe permission to offer direct-to-consumer testing for three of the more than 1,000 known variants of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 that have been found to confer an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. (The tests were previously only available through a doctor.)\n\nBut not everyone is celebrating. Because the gene variants found by the test are extremely rare, most people who take the test won\u2019t come away with much meaningful information, and there\u2019s no good evidence that people who take the test will be better off than those who don\u2019t.\n\nWhat we have is a clash of philosophies: Should consumers have a right to information that some experts have deemed unhelpful and potentially harmful for most people (if it gives a false sense of security to those who test negative or increases anxiety)? Proponents of consumer testing say \u201cyes.\u201d The debate centers on how decisions about genetic testing should be made and who is entitled to a say.\n\nOne thing that there\u2019s agreement on: The vast majority of women diagnosed with breast and ovarian cancer don\u2019t have any known genetic factors. Only about 5 percent to 10 percent of breast cancer cases and 10 percent to 15 percent of ovarian cancer cases occur in people with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene variant. And the gene variants themselves are rare. The mutations detected by the 23andMe test are present in far less than 1 percent of the general population. They\u2019re more common in women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but even then, they still appear in only about two out of 100 of those women.\n\nGiven the rareness of the gene variants found in the test, most people who take it won\u2019t learn anything new, Cecile Janssens, who is an epidemiologist at Emory University and studies genetic links to disease, said in an interview. For most test-takers, being screened is like \u201ctaking a pregnancy test when you already know you are not pregnant,\u201d she wrote in the magazine The Scientist. This is in part why the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts tasked with making evidence-based recommendations, advises against testing for women whose family history does not suggest the presence of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene variants. (It recommends BRCA testing only for people with a pertinent family history.)\n\nAdvocates of testing counter that people are entitled to their genetic information. The 23andMe tests are appropriate for \u201canyone who wants to learn more about themselves and their potential health risks from their DNA,\u201d said Shirley Wu, director of product science at 23andMe. And to ensure that there\u2019s no confusion, the FDA mandates that 23andMe be clear about the limits of the test \u2014 what it can and can\u2019t tell you. Here is an example of some of the information presented with the test results.\n\nAnne Wojcicki, the CEO and co-founder of 23andMe, wrote in a blog post about the new test that even though there aren\u2019t many carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, some women who could benefit from screening aren\u2019t getting tested. And even if the test doesn\u2019t change what you know about your cancer risk, Wu said, \u201cthe results can still inform your conversations with your doctor.\u201d She said that getting a negative result on the test doesn\u2019t mean someone should stop any healthy behaviors or screening that they would normally be doing. Just getting a genetic test helps educate and engage people in their health, she said.\n\nMaybe the test gets people thinking about their health, but the FDA warns people who test positive on 23andMe\u2019s test against using the result to make medical decisions. (If a 23andMe test suggests that a person has a BRCA gene variant, he or she is advised to seek confirmation and counseling from a medical professional.)\n\nThere\u2019s ample evidence to show that genetic risk information does not change behavior, said Timothy Caulfield, who is the research director at the Health Law Institute at the University of Alberta and has studied the use of genetic testing for health promotion. For instance, one study found that giving people information about their genetic risk for developing type 2 diabetes did not change their health behaviors. And simply providing information isn\u2019t enough to make a test useful, said Rita Redberg, a physician at the University of California San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine. \u201cThere has to be some data to suggest that people are better off having had the test than without it, and I don\u2019t think those criteria are met here,\u201d Redberg said.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to consumers to decide whether the test will be useful for them. Janssens has been following the consumer genetics market for 10 years and said that even with the limits of the test presented in plain terms, enthusiasm for it is unlikely to be dampened. The marketing of these tests \u201cthrives on the idea that people can make their own decisions,\u201d Janssens said. If a customer believes that the test has utility for them, then in their view, it does, she said, \u201ceven though the rest of the world and all the experts and academics think it\u2019s useless.\u201d", "author": ["Christie Aschwanden"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-its-like-to-watch-metoo-when-it-is-you-too/", "published": "2018-03-16T17:42:49", "title": "What It\u2019s Like To Watch #MeToo When It Is You, Too", "text": "On average, more than 300,000 Americans experience rape or sexual assault each year. When the #MeToo movement makes headlines, those survivors are reading. How is that affecting people who have experienced sexual violence, to see stories similar to their own blasted across media outlets every day? Experts aren\u2019t sure, but they\u2019re confident that it\u2019s having some kind of impact.\n\nCase in point: In the last three months of 2017, calls to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 a national crisis hotline for people who have experienced sexual trauma \u2014 increased by 23 percent compared with the same period in the previous year. That increase is part of an apparent nationwide jump in sexual abuse victims seeking help from crisis centers. Experts believe there\u2019s a connection between the increase and the rise of #MeToo, which was founded more than a decade ago but took off as a hashtag in October after reports of workplace abuses committed by the rich and powerful drew media attention to the stories of survivors of sexual assault and harassment.\n\nSo are more people calling the hotline now because they feel like #MeToo means they can tell their story and be believed? Or are more people calling the hotline because #MeToo reminded them of their own, personal, pain and now they\u2019re suffering all over again? In short, we can\u2019t say. But the clues left in the stories survivors tell and in the research that exists on the way people respond to trauma suggest that it\u2019s probably a little of both.\n\nIn conversations with survivors of sexual assault, I learned that the impacts of #MeToo are complex, with the potential to heal or retraumatize \u2014 and sometimes both at the same time. On the one hand, being able to talk about their experiences has been healing for the survivors I spoke to \u2014 especially when they could do it in a context that allowed them to reach out to other survivors and help each other.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who have never told anyone\u201d about their abuse, said Kesha Brown Booker, a rape survivor who speaks to universities, churches and other groups through the speakers\u2019 bureau network of RAINN. But then they hear what she has to say. \u201cI speak, and tell my story, and they feel like this person understands and gets it.\u201d\n\nThe potential positives of seeing #MeToo stories in the media seem to line up with what experts have learned about trauma and the process of healing from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIn the first few weeks after an assault, as many as 94 percent of survivors may experience symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares and flashbacks. But most of those people will slowly heal on their own. They won\u2019t \u201cget over it\u201d \u2014 but they do become able to live without pain and don\u2019t develop long-term PTSD, said Edna Foa, who is a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the leading experts on sexual assault and trauma. Even while a minority do end up with longer-term problems, Foa said, they, too, can find relief through treatment. The #MeToo movement appears to be tapping into patterns researchers have seen that predict whose symptoms will dissipate naturally over time and what it takes to help those who seek treatment.\n\n\u201cWe think that social support is a key protective factor against the development of PTSD,\u201d said James Hamilton, professor of psychology at the University of Alabama. It helps explain why most survivors heal naturally over time. So, hearing other survivors of sexual violence talk about their experiences on social media and watching high-profile abusers lose jobs or go to jail could be helpful. It could give survivors a sense that they are part of a community, not foundering alone in dark water. And, Foa said, knowing that it\u2019s possible to think about, or even talk about, what happened without experiencing immobilizing emotional distress is often a first step on the road to recovery for those who struggle with PTSD long term.\n\nBut beyond personal experiences, experts know very little about how watching strangers talk about sexual assault in social or traditional media affects people \u2014 especially people who have, themselves, experienced similar traumas. Neither Foa nor any other experts I spoke with could think of any studies that looked specifically at this issue.\n\nThere is some research that is tangentially connected. For instance, a 2006 study found that crime victims who read about their own cases in the newspaper or saw coverage on TV experienced high rates of negative emotions afterward \u2014 66 percent reported sadness, 48 percent reported fear.\n\nIndeed, the same survivors who told me that #MeToo had been empowering for them also told me that it had been, at times, a painful and retraumatizing reminder of their experience. That was true for Booker. That was also true for Jay Wu, a survivor and communications manager for the National Center for Transgender Equality. Wu identifies as a non-binary gender and uses the pronoun \u201cthey.\u201d \u201cI think partly it\u2019s just the nature of talking about things like this,\u201d they said.\n\nOther studies suggest that media exposure to a trauma that isn\u2019t your own can also be stressful. A survey of more than 2,000 New Yorkers after 9/11, for example, found that people who viewed the most television had a 66 percent greater chance of experiencing PTSD-like symptoms, even though three-quarters of the respondents did not see the disaster first-hand.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that media exposure alone can cause PTSD, said Blair Wisco, professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. At the same time, she said, studies have shown that therapists, first responders and others whose jobs expose them to scenes of trauma do have an increased risk of a sort of vicarious PTSD.\n\nIt\u2019s also the case that, positive or negative, #MeToo media coverage is likely to affect people and groups differently. The survivors I spoke with emphasized that some of how #MeToo affects people is tied up in whether those people can see the movement as working for them \u2014 or being about them at all.\n\nTransgender people, for example, have a higher probability of experiencing sexual assault or violence than the general U.S. population. A large 2015 survey found that nearly half of all trans people had been sexually assaulted. But, Wu said, trans people have often been left out of #MeToo media narratives that center on cisgender women, people whose female gender identity matches the sex they were recognized as having at birth. Some trans survivors have told Wu that #MeToo presents an opportunity to get trans stories out there. But for others, Wu said, it\u2019s just another cultural moment that ignores their existence and their pain.\n\nAnd that issue \u2014 whether all survivors feel like the community #MeToo is building is really for them \u2014 could have wide-reaching consequences for mental health. Booker spoke about this concern. So did Constance, another RAINN speaker and rape survivor who asked that her last name not be used. The media narrative has focused on wealthy, professional, culturally prominent, cisgender, white women, these survivors told me.\n\n\u201cThe actors and models coming out, they\u2019re being heard and taken seriously, but other individuals are not,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t in a particular industry or don\u2019t have the money, you\u2019re dismissed.\u201d If the psychological benefits of #MeToo are centered around creating a feeling of not being alone and building an atmosphere where survivors are believed, then it\u2019s important to know that not all of them are receiving that message.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth-Baker"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-stephen-hawking-taught-me/", "published": "2018-03-15T17:39:25", "title": "What Stephen Hawking Taught Me", "text": "How could someone write a history of time? And how could that person possibly make it brief? Time is a dimension; it is the fabric of reality. Writing a history of time would be like trying to write a history of up, or the history of green.\n\nBut when I read \u201cA Brief History of Time,\u201d Stephen Hawking\u2019s popular-science touchstone, at some point in middle school, it felt more accessible than I expected. It described how we know what we know, and in doing so, it taught me the rules of the universe. I found those rules had profound implications. The book introduced me to the idea that science is a search for meaning amid complexity, and for the answer to why the universe \u2014 and everything else \u2014 came to exist.\n\nDepending on your thoughts about the afterlife, Hawking is no longer among us. He died March 14 at his home in Cambridge, England. He was 76.\n\nHawking\u2019s theories are among the most celebrated discoveries in modern physics, and defy simple explanation even among his peers. But to me and millions of others who read his books, he was a wonderfully approachable teacher. Because of Hawking, I came to see physics as the foundation and pinnacle of science and philosophy.\n\nIn his book, I learned that we actually know quite a lot about how we got here. About 13.8 billion years ago, at a point of infinite density, the universe began in what we call the Big Bang, and is still flying outward today. We have no idea why this happened, or what set it off.\n\nThrough Hawking\u2019s book, I also learned about how all this might come to an end. The book was my introduction to entropy, a law of thermodynamics that says, basically, things even out in the end. And further, that this is the way things are supposed to be. The attempt to instill order from chaos is one of the foundational projects of human society, and certainly one of our greatest sources of trouble. Yet disorder is the natural way of the universe; entropy always increases.\n\nI also learned that nothing can escape entropy \u2014 not even black holes. This was one of Hawking\u2019s great insights, and it is one of the most important discoveries in the history of modern physics. Like the philosophical notion of entropy, it has profound meaning for us all.\n\nBlack holes are so named because they are bottomless gaping maws of destruction from which not even light can escape. Except when it can! Hawking realized that black holes, by warping spacetime, apparently leak out a form of radiation. This will eventually cause them to dry up and evaporate. Even black holes have a thermodynamically limited lifespan, it appears. They will fade away. The sun will fade away. Eventually, everything fades away.\n\nHawking wrote an equation that explains this black hole radiation, which is now named for him. It set the cornerstone of four decades of efforts to come up with a grand unified theory, a way to reconcile thermodynamics, gravity and quantum mechanics (though we still haven\u2019t worked it out).\n\nThrough Hawking and Albert Einstein, I also learned that perspective is the key to knowing the universe. According to quantum theory, pairs of particles throughout the universe are constantly bubbling in and out of existence, and becoming many different manifestations of things at any given time and place. These are called \u201cvirtual particles.\u201d\n\nHawking realized that at a black hole\u2019s jaws \u2014 a special, weird location called the event horizon \u2014 these virtual particle pairs can be split apart. When this happens, the black hole swallows one and not the other. They become no longer virtual, but a definite thing. The black hole acts as the decider of their fates, if you will. At least, this is how it would appear to an observer on the outside of the black hole. So, whether or not a particle is really here, like here here, in time and space, literally depends on how you look at it. Reality depends on your perspective.\n\nThese discoveries made Hawking famous, as did his debilitating ALS and his sense of humor, temper and ego. He was the most recognizable scientist since Einstein, and a prominent figure in popular culture.\n\nHe was not uncontroversial. Hawking often inspired, sometimes even fomented, controversy in the highest echelons of science, even as he sold millions of books and enthralled multitudes with his simplified and witty explanations. He famously made public wagers with other physicists and gloated when he finally won. He was a complicated \u2014 some would say flawed \u2014 parent and spouse. He worried candidly and publicly about contacting aliens, and about artificial intelligence. He boycotted a science conference in Israel at the behest of Palestinian researchers.\n\nYet he is one of the rare Western public intellectuals whom almost everyone could respect in some way regardless of politics. I tried to think of someone else who could fill the void he leaves \u2014 brilliant scientist, philosopher, writer, engaging speaker, teacher, advocate for government-subsidized health care and champion of people with disabilities \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since I read my parents\u2019 paperback copy of \u201cA Brief History of Time.\u201d But the ideas Hawking presented in it have stayed with me. Things fall apart, and it\u2019s okay. We have limited time in this universe, so make the most of it. Try to see things from others\u2019 point of view, because doing so will enable you to construct a more meaningful existence.\n\nStephen Hawking served as my tutor for these physics laws-turned-life-lessons.

But the people who have spent the last two decades trying to understand this phenomenon are still here, and still trying to sell politicians and the public on possible solutions that are complicated, expensive and tough to sum up in a sound bite.\n\nAny research into school shootings is made more difficult by how uncommon such shootings are. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight wrote about the more than 33,000 people killed by guns in America every year. Of those deaths, roughly one-third \u2014 about 12,000 \u2014 are homicides, but hardly any are due to mass shootings. If you define mass shootings as as an event where a lone attacker indiscriminately kills four or more people, in a public place, unrelated gang activity or robbery, then mass shootings account for a tiny portion of all gun homicides \u2014 probably a fraction of a percent.\n\nThere have been many attempts to formally quantify school shootings, but, as with mass shootings, all use different definitions. Our chart is taken from a 2016 paper that defined a school shooting as a premeditated incident of gun violence that took place in an educational setting, killed or wounded at least three victims (not counting the perpetrator), was unrelated to gang activity and was not an act of domestic violence. This data suggests that school shootings, though still extremely rare, are more common today than they were 40 years ago.\n\nBut no matter how you define a school shooting, they\u2019re still a subset of a subset \u2014 just as mass shootings account for a fraction of all gun homicides, school shootings account for a fraction of all mass shooting deaths. In 1995, when O\u2019Toole began to study school shootings, they seemed like even more of an outlier than they are today. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even call it a phenomenon,\u201d she said. \u201cPrior to Columbine, there was no indication that it was going to become one of those crimes that just becomes part of the culture. It looked like it could have faded away.\u201d\n\nThese uncommon but high-profile tragedies had also drawn the attention of Marisa Randazzo. In 1999, she was the chief psychologist for the Secret Service and became a part of a joint effort between the Secret Service and Department of Education to better understand school shooters and how to prevent attacks before they happened. Randazzo had previously worked on the Exceptional Case Study Project \u2014 a Secret Service project designed to better understand people who threaten the president and other public figures. Like school shootings, assassinations are extremely rare events that have a huge impact on society. That rarity makes them hard to study \u2014 and makes it hard to tell blowhards from real threats. But their impact makes them important to understand.\n\nRandazzo found that the project\u2019s findings echoed what she was learning about school shootings. For instance, the Secret Service had once focused its energy on threats made by people with a history of violent crime or who had a mental illness that caused them to act irrationally. But the Exceptional Case Study Project analysis showed that most people who actually carry out attacks didn\u2019t meet either of those criteria. Instead, a better way to figure out who was a really a threat was to talk to friends, family and coworkers \u2014 most attackers had discussed their plans with other people.\n\nRandazzo and O\u2019Toole\u2019s parallel reports came to remarkably similar conclusions.\n\nFirst, these studies determined that there wasn\u2019t much point in trying to profile school shooters. Yes, most were (and remain) male and white, but those categories were so broad that they\u2019re essentially useless in identifying potential threats ahead of time, Randazzo said. What\u2019s more, she said, more detailed profiles risked stigmatizing perfectly reasonable behaviors \u2014 like wearing wearing black and listening to loud music.\n\nInstead, the reports focused on the behavior and mental state of the young people who chose to kill. While these teens were deeply troubled, that\u2019s not quite the same thing as saying that those who commit school shootings are just irredeemably mentally ill. Nor does it mean those young people suddenly snapped, giving no warning. \u201cSchool shooters typically do this out of a profound adolescent crisis,\u201d said James Garbarino, a professor of psychology at Loyola University who specializes in teen violence and began studying school shooters in the late 1990s.\n\nRandazzo described a pattern of young people who were deeply depressed, unable to cope with their lives, who saw no other way out of a bad situation. The stressors they faced wouldn\u2019t necessarily be problems that an adult would see as especially traumatic, but these young people were unable to handle their emotions, sadness and anger, and they started acting in ways that were, essentially, suicidal.\n\nSome of the best data on the mental state of school shooters has come from interviews with those shooters (and would-be shooters) who survived the attack. Randazzo described one such living school shooter, currently serving multiple life sentences, who told her that before the attack he spent weeks vacillating between suicide and homicide. Only after he tried and failed to kill himself did he settle on killing others in hopes that someone would kill him. Garbarino, who has interviewed dozens of people who went to prison for life as teenagers, both for school shootings and other violent crimes, heard many similar stories.\n\n\u201cThe reason I emphasize this is that we know so much about how to help someone who is suicidal, and those same resources can be used very effectively with someone who is planning to engage in school violence,\u201d Randazzo said. So how do we spot the ones who are planning an attack at a school? The studies she and O\u2019Toole published years ago showed that, like people planning to attack the president, would-be school shooters don\u2019t keep their plans to themselves. They tell friends or even teachers that they want to kill. They talk about their anger and their suicidality. And as more teens have attacked their schoolmates, that pattern has proved to hold true over time. It was true for Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland shooter. It was true for the at least four potential school shootings that were averted in the weeks after Parkland \u2014 all stopped because the would-be killers spoke or wrote about their plans and someone told law enforcement.\n\nWhile all the experts I spoke with said that policies that keep guns out of the hands of teenagers are an important part of preventing mass shootings, they all also said it was crucial to set up systems that spot teens who are are struggling and may become dangerous.\n\nBut those systems seem to break down over time. Randazzo told me that her team had trained numerous school districts in school shooting prevention back in the early 2000s and, as of this year, many of those districts no longer had prevention systems in place. Thanks to staff turnover and budget reprioritization, that institutional knowledge simply withered away. And ironically, that happens precisely because school shootings are so rare. \u201cIt takes time and effort for a school to create a team and get training,\u201d Randazzo said. \u201cAnd, fortunately, threatening behavior doesn\u2019t happen often enough\u201d to spur schools to action.\n\nRead more: Mass Shootings Are A Bad Way To Understand Gun Violence", "author": ["Maggie Koerth-Baker"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-after-22-trillion-digits-were-still-no-closer-to-the-end-of-pi/", "published": "2018-03-14T10:58:05", "title": "Even After 22 Trillion Digits, We\u2019re Still No Closer To The End Of Pi", "text": "Depending on your philosophical views on time and calendars and so on, today is something like the 4.5 billionth Pi Day that Earth has witnessed. But that long history is nothing compared to the infinity of pi itself.\n\nA refresher for those of you who have forgotten your seventh-grade math lessons : Pi, or the Greek letter \\(\\pi\\), is a mathematical constant equal to the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter \u2014 C/d. It lurks in every circle, and equals approximately 3.14. (Hence Pi Day, which takes place on March 14, aka 3/14.)\n\nBut the simplicity of its definition belies pi\u2019s status as the most fascinating, and most studied, number in the history of the world. While treating pi as equal to 3.14 is often good enough, the number really continues on forever, a seemingly random series of digits ambling infinitely outward and obeying no discernible pattern \u2014 3.14159265358979\u2026. That\u2019s because it\u2019s an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be represented by a fraction of two whole numbers (although approximations such as 22/7 can come close).\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped humanity from furiously chipping away at pi\u2019s unending mountain of digits. We\u2019ve been at it for millennia.\n\nPeople have been interested in the number for basically as long we\u2019ve understood math. The ancient Egyptians, according to a document that also happens to be the world\u2019s oldest collection of math puzzles, knew that pi was something like 3.1. A millennium or so later, an estimate of pi showed up in the bible: The Old Testament, in 1 Kings, seems to imply that pi equals 3: \u201cAnd he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about \u2026 and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.\u201d\n\nArchimedes, the greatest mathematician of antiquity, got as far as 3.141 by around 250 B.C. Archimedes approached his calculation of pi geometrically, by sandwiching a circle between two straight-edged regular polygons. Measuring polygons was easier than measuring circles, and Archimedes measured pi-like ratios as the number of the polygons\u2019 sides increased, until they closely resembled circles.\n\nMeaningful improvement on Archimedes\u2019s method wouldn\u2019t come for hundreds of years. Using the new technique of integration, mathematicians like Gottfried Leibniz, one of the fathers of calculus, could prove such elegant equations for pi as:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\\frac{\\pi}{4}=1-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{7}+\\frac{1}{9}-\\ldots\\end{equation*}\n\nThe right-hand side, just like pi, continues forever. If you add and subtract and add and subtract all those simple fractions, you\u2019ll inch ever closer to pi\u2019s true value. The problem is that you\u2019ll inch very, very slowly. To get just 10 correct digits of pi, you\u2019d have to add about 5 billion fractions together.\n\nBut more efficient formulas were discovered. Take this one, from Leonhard Euler, probably the greatest mathematician ever, in the 18th century:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}=\\frac{1}{1^2}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{3^2}+\\ldots\\end{equation*}\n\nAnd Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught mathematical genius from India, discovered the totally surprising and bizarre equation below in the early 1900s. Each additional term in this sum adds eight correct digits to an estimate of pi:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\\frac{1}{\\pi}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{9801}\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}\\end{equation*}\n\nMuch like with the search for large prime numbers, computers blasted this pi-digit search out of Earth orbit and into deep space starting in the mid-1900s. ENIAC, an early electronic computer and the only computer in the U.S. in 1949, calculated pi to over 2,000 places, nearly doubling the record.\n\nAs computers got faster and memory became more available, digits of pi began falling like dominoes, racing down the number\u2019s infinite line, impossibly far but also never closer to the end. Building off of Ramanujan\u2019s formula, the mathematical brothers Gregory and David Chudnovsky calculated over 2 billion digits of pi in the early 1990s using a homemade supercomputer housed in a cramped and sweltering Manhattan apartment. They\u2019d double their tally to 4 billion digits after a few years.\n\nThe current record now stands at over 22 trillion digits \u2014 thousands of times more than the Chudnovskys\u2019 home-brewed supercomputer \u2014 worked out after 105 days of computation on a Dell server using a freely available program called y-cruncher. That program, which uses both the Ramanujan and Chudnovsky formulas, has been used to find record numbers of digits of not only pi, but other endless, irrational numbers, including e, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), \\(\\log{2}\\) and the golden ratio.\n\nBut maybe 22 trillion digits is just a bit of overkill. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses only 15 digits of pi for its highest-accuracy calculations for interplanetary navigation. Heck, Isaac Newton knew that many digits 350 years ago. \u201cA value of \\(\\pi\\) to 40 digits would be more than enough to compute the circumference of the Milky Way galaxy to an error less than the size of a proton,\u201d a group of researchers wrote in a useful history of the number. So why would we ever need 22 trillion digits?\n\nSure, we\u2019ve learned a bit of math theory while digging deep into pi: about fast Fourier transforms and that pi is probably a so-called normal number. But the more satisfying answer seems to me to have nothing to do with math. Maybe it has to do with what President John F. Kennedy said about building a space program. We do things like this \u201cnot because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s one major difference: The moon is not infinitely far away; we can actually get there. Maybe this famous quote about chess is more apt: \u201cLife is not long enough for chess \u2014 but that is the fault of life, not of chess.\u201d\n\nPi is too long for humankind. But that is the fault of humankind, not of pi.

It\u2019s not that I hate my iPhone, exactly, but I frequently hate how I use it. I check it all the time, especially when I\u2019m in the middle of hard work requiring concentration and effort. When I\u2019m bored, I look at whatever the internet is serving up to me, often getting anxiety-provoking information I\u2019d rather not ruminate about right then. I feel nervous about being \u201coff the grid\u201d if I don\u2019t have my phone with me, even if I\u2019m unreachable only for an hour or two. And yet, despite all these ill effects, I keep carrying and checking my phone.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a slave to my mobile device, so I jumped at the chance to serve as a guinea pig for the program outlined in Catherine Price\u2019s new book, \u201cHow to Break Up With Your Phone.\u201d I also dug into the research and talked with experts who study digital media use. What I learned is that it\u2019s possible to take back our lives and attention from our phones, but it takes some planning and commitment.\n\nWith the world of possibilities it presents, the phone has become something that rewards us for looking at it, no matter where we are or what we\u2019re trying to do. That\u2019s a powerful pull, said Adrian Ward, a professor of marketing at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cWe are always carrying around this attentional, gravitational black hole,\u201d he said. In a study published last year, Ward and his colleagues asked participants to place their devices close and in sight, nearby and out of sight, or in another room. Then the researchers tested participants\u2019 cognitive capacity. The results suggested that just having your smartphone present affects cognitive capacity even if you aren\u2019t checking it or even thinking about it. We have a limited supply of cognitive resources, and the effort required to not pay attention to your phone siphons off some of those resources, Ward said. The study also showed that the more you depend on your phone, the more likely you are to suffer from its presence. Putting the phone face down or even turning it off doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nA more effective solution may be just keeping the thing around less often. \u201cI hide it in the corner and get it out of my realm of possibility,\u201d Ward said. I\u2019ve found that the more my phone is out of sight or, even better, charging in the other room, the less I feel compelled to check it.\n\nPrice\u2019s four-week plan to change your relationship with your phone builds up to a 24-hour trial separation. When I tried that as part of her focus group last year, I realized that my phone was often less necessary than I assumed. I had family activities scheduled during my 24-hour break, and in the absence of the phone, I was able to enjoy these activities without distraction. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve repeated the exercise, but I\u2019m trying to work more phone-free stretches into my day. Price instructed us to list the situations and contexts in which we had decided not to use our phones, and I found a handful, including anytime I\u2019m engaging with another human being, when I\u2019m waiting in line, when I\u2019m in my bedroom (it now charges elsewhere at night), while I\u2019m watching TV and when I\u2019m on the subway (with an exception for podcasts). I\u2019m batting about .800 in sticking to those intentions.\n\nSmartphones often lure us into multitasking. Think of all the ways you can use them when you\u2019re also doing something else. (I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever had a text conversation without simultaneously doing something else.) This can be fatal in the case of distracted driving or walking. And it can hurt your performance on the primary task at hand. We cannot effectively focus on two things at once, and it takes time for your brain to switch between tasks. That means multitasking actually doesn\u2019t improve productivity, said L. Mark Carrier, an experimental psychologist at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Research suggests that for college students, multitasking while studying and during lectures negatively affects overall learning and grades, he said. A study by Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues shows that after only 20 minutes of interrupted work, \u201cpeople reported significantly higher stress, frustration, workload, effort, and pressure.\u201d\n\nOne way to reduce the allure is to remove tempting distractions from the phone so it doesn\u2019t contain quite as much of the universe. Price suggests deleting apps that grab your attention but don\u2019t improve your life. Goodbye, social media! I\u2019m much less likely to reach for the phone if there\u2019s no Twitter or Facebook. (Instagram, which I\u2019ve only recently started to use, is a potential threat, but it doesn\u2019t call to me the way the others did. So for now, I\u2019m keeping it.) She also suggests hiding apps that are compelling but only somewhat useful and deleting notifications altogether. Tristan Harris, who worked at Google before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology, advocates setting your phone display to black and white, which he says is far less appealing than brightly colored icons and has helped many people reduce their phones\u2019 appeal.\n\nMy biggest struggle with my phone is that I check it more often than is necessary, and then I feel bad afterwards. \u201cPeople mistakenly assume you have to like something to do it over and over again,\u201d said Adam Alter, a professors of marketing at New York University and the author of \u201cIrresistible,\u201d a book about behavioral technology addiction. That\u2019s a logical assumption because \u201cthere\u2019s a strong correlation between how much we enjoy something and how much we do it,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s not a perfect correlation, he said. We overeat while hating the feeling of having overeaten. We fall in love with people who aren\u2019t good for us and come back for more. I haven\u2019t experienced disturbed sleep from my phone, but plenty of other people have. Regardless of whether we\u2019re truly \u201caddicted\u201d to phones and other technology, many people don\u2019t like their phone habits but find it very difficult to change them.\n\nEmail is my greatest anxiety-producer \u2014 I feel compelled to check it every seven minutes precisely in the late afternoon and evening hours. And I worry that I won\u2019t be able to respond to a work-related message quickly enough (whatever \u201cquickly enough\u201d means these days). That drives a compulsion to check, which relieves the fear of missing out for a while \u2026 until it builds up again. And when I check my email, I end up checking everything else, too. It\u2019s almost inevitable that I see a news story I wasn\u2019t prepared to worry about just right then.\n\nBy far the biggest insight I got from Price\u2019s plan was to think of my phone not as a monolith but as a collection of tools I dip into individually when I really need or want to use them. If I have a real use for the phone \u2014 coordinating dinner plans via text \u2014 I do that and nothing else. And for email, I put myself on a schedule: After work, I can check it hourly until 7 p.m., and then I\u2019m done for the day. I backslide on this fairly frequently, but when I stick to it, I feel fantastic \u2014 like my phone is no longer the boss of me.", "author": ["Katherine Hobson"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-dozens-of-mass-shootings-didnt-change-americans-minds-on-guns/", "published": "2018-02-27T10:58:43", "title": "Why Dozens Of Mass Shootings Didn\u2019t Change Americans\u2019 Minds On Guns", "text": "The mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, isn\u2019t fading quietly from the headlines like so many acts of gun violence before it. Nearly two weeks after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, media attention is still focused on the survivors and parents of victims who are demanding action on gun control, and lawmakers are showing signs of responding.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to make the reaction to this shooting feel different from the aftermath of other gun-related massacres. But is it a sign that Americans are actually changing the way they think about mass shootings and coalescing around a push for gun control? That may depend on whether this event is able to move people past a series of complicated psychological barriers that can keep Americans from thinking about shootings in the same way they think about about other acts of mass carnage, like terrorism, that can sometimes spark more national unity and political momentum.\n\nUnderstanding why mass shootings haven\u2019t translated into a broader national movement for gun control in the past can help us evaluate whether the Parkland shooting is likely to spur change. According to psychological research, there are a few key reasons why mass shootings haven\u2019t galvanized a lasting, large-scale crackdown on guns so far.\n\nRepeated acts of violence can numb our emotional responses\n\nThe exact number of mass shootings is hard to pin down, but gun violence is disturbingly common in the United States, especially compared with other developed countries. And repeated exposure to acts of violence \u2014 even when that exposure comes secondhand through the news \u2014 can have a numbing effect, according to Yuval Neria, a professor of psychology at Columbia University.\n\nThis effect has been mostly studied with regard to terrorist attacks in countries like Israel that have experienced chronic violence, but there\u2019s no reason to imagine that it wouldn\u2019t extend to mass shootings or other acts of gun violence as well, Neria and other psychologists said, because the two events aren\u2019t psychologically distinct. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a difference between mass shootings and acts of terrorism in terms of how they affect the brain \u2014 they\u2019re both intentional, man-made acts that inflict horror and fear,\u201d he said.\n\nHabituation to terrorism can actually have something of a useful function \u2014 by defusing the sense of vulnerability that acts of terror are designed to cause, habituation can prevent terrorism from being effective \u2014 but becoming acclimated to repeated violence also creates the sense that these are uncontrollable events for which there\u2019s no clear solution, according to Dov Waxman, a professor of political science at Northeastern University who has studied terrorism and mass violence in Israel. As a result, he said, the public may not exert much pressure in favor of any particular course of action.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t good at calculating risk\n\nSurvivors of many previous mass shootings have tried to make their case for gun control by arguing that we\u2019re all vulnerable to gun violence and should therefore want to enact regulations that could prevent future shootings. \u201cConsider your own children,\u201d said Nicole Hockley, the mother of a 6-year-old who died in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, in a listening session with President Trump a week after the Parkland massacre. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be me \u2014 no parent does.\u201d That might seem persuasive, especially to parents. But Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon who studies risk, said that our perceptions of risk and fear aren\u2019t straightforward or logical \u2014 they \u201creside in us as a gut feeling rather than an analytic calculation.\u201d\n\nSlovic\u2019s research has shown that because feelings and intuition play such a strong role in our evaluations of risk, we\u2019re less likely to instinctively perceive items that are familiar or beneficial as something that\u2019s hazardous and should be banned or regulated. This has particularly strong implications for gun owners. \u201cA lot of people own guns or know someone who owns a gun or see a general benefit to guns,\u201d Slovic said. \u201cPositive feelings about something like guns can dampen the emotional response to an event like a shooting and make it feel less risky.\u201d\n\nOf course, having an intense emotional response to a violent event isn\u2019t always a good thing \u2014 some researchers have argued that Americans\u2019 fears of terrorism are overblown and result in misdirected and wasted resources. And that poses a risk for the gun violence debate as well, since it\u2019s possible to argue that fears of mass shootings are exaggerated given that they constitute only a small subset of gun deaths overall.\n\nAmericans are divided on who \u2014 or what \u2014 is to blame for gun violence\n\nAnother crucial distinction between terrorist attacks and mass shootings, from a psychological perspective, is that terrorists\u2019 ideologies and goals are relatively clear, while mass shooters\u2019 motives tend to be diverse or opaque. The apparent randomness of mass shootings makes it hard to collectively focus blame or anger, according to Sarah Lowe, a professor of psychology at Montclair State University. This could help explain why repeated exposure to terrorist attacks in Israel is seen as having helped strengthen national unity, while mass shootings in the U.S. seem to sow divisions.\n\nThis confusion about the motives of mass shooters may also exacerbate the public\u2019s tendency to seize on divergent explanations for acts of gun violence, making it difficult to come to any kind of consensus on policy. A study published last year found that gun owners were far less likely than people who don\u2019t own guns to say that they blamed mass shootings on the availability of guns. While both groups assigned similar levels of blame to the shooter and pop culture, gun owners assigned more responsibility to parenting as a reason for the shooting, while people who don\u2019t own guns placed more of the onus on the weapons. The study also found that people who had guns in their homes were more likely to believe that shootings would happen again, regardless of whether the government took action.\n\nThe authors attributed the findings to a psychological concept called \u201cmotivated reasoning,\u201d which is when people\u2019s responses and judgments match up with whatever they\u2019re already motivated to believe. Gun owners\u2019 feeling that their identity is connected to guns \u2014 and the general politicization of gun rights \u2014 likely amplify this tendency, according to the study\u2019s authors. According to polling from Pew, about half of gun owners say that owning a gun is an important part of who they are. Party and ideology are also strongly linked to perspectives on the importance of gun rights: Regardless of whether they own guns, Republicans are far likelier than Democrats to say that the right to own guns is essential to their own freedom.\n\nGun control advocates, meanwhile, may believe that particular policies are necessary even in the absence of concrete proof that they work. All of this makes it hard to unite the country on a single course of action, especially one that involves government regulation of guns.\n\nThe characteristics of the Parkland shooting \u2014 and the response to it \u2014 mean that this incident could be positioned to overcome some of these psychological barriers. Slovic speculated that focusing on restrictions that target the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used in the shooting, rather than guns as a category, might make it easier for gun owners to psychologically distinguish the gun used in the shooting from the weapons they personally possess. That could create some common ground that leads to banning or at least limiting the AR-15\u2019s use.\n\nThe numbing effect of repeated exposure to violence is also enabled by a quick drop-off in media coverage, but the Parkland students\u2019 vivid stories \u2014 combined with images, text messages and videos from the attack \u2014 could imbue the event with continued urgency and make viewers empathize with survivors in a new way. \u201cHearing directly from people who have experienced the trauma is understandably very powerful,\u201d said Sandro Galea, a professor of public health at Boston University who studies trauma and firearms.\n\nBut it will be hard for gun control advocates to change the broader social context \u2014 in particular, beliefs about the origins of mass shootings. In an ABC News poll released in the wake of the shooting, Americans were more likely to say that better mental health screening and treatment could have prevented the shooting than to say that stricter gun control laws could have prevented it. A substantial minority also said that allowing teachers to carry guns could have prevented the shooting \u2014 a suggestion that has been echoed by the president \u2014 signaling that Americans still are far from unified on whether gun control is the right course of action for combating mass shootings.\n\nThis could be the biggest challenge for activists trying to galvanize support for gun reform. Even if the activism around this shooting can successfully keep the issue of preventing gun violence in the national conversation, that doesn\u2019t mean the country will unify behind gun control as the solution.", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-should-have-stayed-home-this-flu-season/", "published": "2018-02-23T21:10:13", "title": "This Year\u2019s Super Bad Flu Season In 20 Maps", "text": "Influenza isn\u2019t just widespread \u2014 the strains in circulation are also severe. As the following chart illustrates, the share of doctor visits for flu and flu-like illnesses has not been this high since the 2009-10 season, when the flu hit early and hard but then quickly declined. (The flu season typically begins around October, peaks somewhere between December and February and peters out by the end of May.)\n\nStill, there\u2019s some good news out this week. Data released Friday shows that, after a steep and steady rise over the past weeks, doctor visits for flu and flu-like illnesses are finally dropping.\n\nThe CDC tracks \u201cflu-like illnesses\u201d because viruses other than influenza, such as respiratory syncytial virus, can provoke flu-like symptoms too. Making a definitive diagnosis requires lab testing that takes time and isn\u2019t done in all cases. But what makes influenza on its own noteworthy is that it can become severe enough to kill you \u2014 and there\u2019s a vaccine against it.\n\nPrior to each flu season, researchers try to predict which strains will circulate in the coming year so that they can include these in that season\u2019s vaccine. But some years their predictions are better than others. On Feb. 16, the CDC released its latest data on the effectiveness of this year\u2019s vaccine. The numbers showed that the U.S. flu vaccine\u2019s overall effectiveness was 36 percent, which means that a vaccinated person reduced the risk of getting sick enough with the flu to seek a doctor visit by about one-third.\n\nBut the vaccine was only about 25 percent effective against a strain called H3N2, a particularly nasty subtype associated with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths than other strains. And that\u2019s a problem, because the H3N2 strain has been the most predominant this year. \u201cWe see lower protection against the H3N2 strain than we see against others, and that\u2019s a consistent finding from year to year,\u201d said Edward Belongia, an epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute in Wisconsin who has tracked the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness for the CDC over the past 14 flu seasons. The reasons for this aren\u2019t entirely clear, but there are a few preliminary and puzzling clues:\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence to suggest that the first flu virus you\u2019re exposed to as a child may orient your immune system to respond best to that kind of flu virus. This suggests that people who were exposed to H3N2 as children may mount a better immune response to it, Belongia said. If that\u2019s true, people older than 50 may be especially vulnerable: \u201cBefore 1968, no one was being exposed to H3N2,\u201d he said. Numerous studies going back to the 1970s suggest that people who are vaccinated every year may not get as much protection as those who get the vaccine one year but not the previous one or two years before then. This so-called repeated vaccination effect is not always present, and \u201cwe don\u2019t know what\u2019s driving it,\u201d Belongia said. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated and may be different in children than in older adults.\u201d The H3N2 viruses can mutate when grown in eggs for producing the vaccines, and that can lead to meaningful changes in how well the vaccine works, even if it was well-matched to the strains in circulation.\n\nWhat does this all mean? The flu vaccine is helpful, but it\u2019s not enough to get everyone through the winter without coming down with the crud. Even at the peak of the season, Belongia said, only something like 40 percent to 50 percent of the people who seek care for flu-like symptoms actually have influenza. And until scientists develop a universal flu vaccine that\u2019s effective against all strains, the vaccines we have will only reduce the severity of flu season, not eliminate it.\n\nIf we want to get serious about preventing flu deaths \u2014 particularly if there\u2019s a pandemic or a dangerous new strain \u2014 we should also give serious thought to quarantine strategies. The word quarantine carries a lot of political and ethical baggage, but it doesn\u2019t have to mean restricting travel. It can also include promoting policies that enable people to stay home when they are sick.\n\nPeople who have the flu are very infectious, and if they can stay home from work or school (and the grocery store and post office and everywhere else), they can reduce the spread of the disease. But our societal and workplace norms can make it hard to stay home when you\u2019re sick. People who have a respiratory illness should avoid passing things like money or food back and forth, and yet workers in jobs that require tasks like these may find it especially hard to get (or afford) time off.\n\n\u201cWe have many workplaces where people don\u2019t have an opportunity to take any paid sick leave, so you have a strong incentive to come into work no matter how sick you are,\u201d Belongia said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the solution is, but this needs to be looked at in terms of sick leave policies.\u201d\n\nAs this brutal flu season barrels on, taking precautions to stop its spread remains crucial. In many cases, that can mean avoiding public places when you\u2019re ill. Yes, you can spread the flu in the early stages, before you\u2019re flat-out sick, but you\u2019re particularly contagious when you\u2019re in the thick of the symptoms. And in that case, unless you require urgent medical care, the best thing you can do is stay the hell home.", "author": ["Christie Aschwanden"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-one-thing-for-trump-to-like-uranium-its-another-for-him-to-save-it/", "published": "2018-02-21T17:01:37", "title": "It\u2019s One Thing For Trump To Like Uranium. It\u2019s Another For Him To Save It.", "text": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A mining industry is trapped in a state of slow economic decline and looks to the Trump administration to reverse its fortunes.\n\nThat could be the lead-in to a story about coal \u2014 an industry the administration has made a point of promoting. But it\u2019s also similar to the story of uranium, the radioactive mineral that serves as a raw material for manufacturing fuel for nuclear power plants and the explosive cores of nuclear weapons. The key difference: Although coal companies have pushed for reduced regulation, representatives of uranium mining companies told me in an interview that they don\u2019t want less environmental protection. They want protection of a different kind, however.\n\nIn its efforts to make coal great again, the Trump administration has made a point of embracing the industry, cutting regulations and talking up the mineral\u2019s importance. Uranium hasn\u2019t gotten quite the same level of personal attention from the president. (There\u2019s been a distinct lack of \u201cTrump Digs Uranium\u201d signs, for instance.) But his administration has made several moves in the past year that seem to favor uranium mining interests: It shrunk the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah in a way that would make it easier for companies to mine uranium on hundreds of previously established claims in the area; it proposed ending a ban on uranium mining near the Grand Canyon; it moved forward on a proposed uranium mine near the Black Hills; it nominated a deputy administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency who used to be a lobbyist for a uranium mining company; and it left an Obama-era proposal about groundwater protections at uranium mining sites in limbo \u2014 neither approving the proposed rule nor rejecting it.\n\nBut while it\u2019s taken outside economists to point out that environmental protection rollbacks aren\u2019t going to save the coal industry, uranium industry insiders say they have little interest in taking advantage of the loosened environmental protections the Trump administration has offered them. \u201cThere\u2019s not a big push to start up new mines [on former federal lands]; the price is way too low,\u201d said John Cash, vice president for regulatory affairs at the uranium mining company Ur-Energy. \u201cThe market is really oversupplied at this point.\u201d He said uranium mining companies don\u2019t want to roll back environmental regulation. Instead, they\u2019d rather the government block foreign competition.\n\nThere was a time when it was good to be a U.S. uranium mining company. During the Cold War, the federal government set up a series of policies that had the effect of guaranteeing uranium miners a high price for their product, said Luke Danielson, president of the Sustainable Development Strategies Group, which consults on minerals development projects around the world. \u201cPeople made massive amounts of money in this boom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the mid-\u201960s, the government realized we had enough uranium stockpiled to last a really long time, and it pulled the plug.\u201d Production rebounded in the 1970s \u2014 a time of optimism about the future of nuclear energy \u2014 but the output of the U.S. uranium industry has been on the decline since 1980.\n\nThat trend continues as old nuclear power plants close and aren\u2019t replaced. Meanwhile, contrary to the collective wisdom of the 20th century, demand for electricity doesn\u2019t seem to have to go up, exponentially, forever. Back then, the industry believed that there would always be new demand and that new power plants would have to be built to meet it, said Nick Carter, executive vice president for uranium at the UX Consulting Co., a nuclear industry data and consulting firm. But demand has stagnated, and the nuclear industry hasn\u2019t had much luck competing, cost-wise, against cheaper natural gas, wind and solar resources. So when utility companies buy nuclear fuel, they are focused on keeping costs low and are looking for the best deal. And that usually isn\u2019t coming from the U.S.\n\nIn 2016, just 10 percent of the uranium purchased by the owners of nuclear power plants was domestically sourced. That\u2019s why Cash and Paul Goranson, chief operating officer for Energy Fuels, another uranium mining company, want help on the demand side of the equation. In January, their two companies filed a petition with the U.S. Commerce Department asking for an investigation into whether the industry needs government protection against foreign competitors. Only 14 of these investigations have taken place since 1980, and it\u2019s rarer still for the government to take action. Ultimately, though, Cash and Goranson would like to see the administration mandate that 25 percent of all the uranium purchased by U.S. electric utility companies come from U.S. uranium mines. Fighting foreign competition would matter more, they say, than repealing environmental protections.\n\nBut it still might not be enough to rebound the industry to its previous highs or keep it solvent over the long term.\n\nThe international market for uranium has been decidedly less grim \u2014 at least, it was up until the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan (and the subsequent closure of power plants there and in Germany). That event sent the price of uranium into a tailspin and left the world with large stockpiles of uranium and little demand for it. Even countries usually seen as the big winners in the global uranium mining industry have scaled back production. There are new nuclear power plants being built in China, India, Russia and other countries, said Keith Florig, who is a research scholar at the University of Florida and studies risk and the nuclear energy industry. But those countries\u2019 power plants are primarily buying uranium from domestic mines or from mines they have developed and control in other countries. Worldwide demand for uranium could go up and still leave U.S. producers behind.\n\nOne reason that U.S. companies would have trouble competing with producers from those other countries is the difference in environmental regulations. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, around 40 percent of the world\u2019s uranium came from Kazakhstan, a country that, according to experts, can offer its uranium at a very cheap price because it\u2019s not doing much in the way of environmental protection. Kazakhstan mines uranium by pumping a sulfuric acid solution into the ground and processing the uranium that binds to it. In the U.S., this process, called in-situ mining, is less toxic, but more expensive, using a sodium bicarbonate solution. U.S. uranium miners also have to remediate the groundwater at in-situ leaching sites, something that Cash and Goranson said isn\u2019t required in Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhstan is the world\u2019s uranium miner Top 10 uranium-producing countries and their share of resources in the ground, as of Jan. 1, 2015 Share of global uranium Country production resources in the ground Kazakhstan 41% \u2013 13% \u2013 Canada 16 \u2013 9 \u2013 Australia 9 \u2013 29 \u2013 Niger 7 \u2013 5 \u2013 Namibia 6 \u2013 5 \u2013 Russia 5 \u2013 9 \u2013 Uzbekistan 4 \u2013 2 \u2013 United States 3 \u2013 1 \u2013 China 3 \u2013 5 \u2013 Ukraine 2 \u2013 2 \u2013 Sources: OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nUranium producers and politicians from uranium-producing states have pushed back against recent EPA efforts to increase groundwater protections at in-situ mining sites, but Cash said the U.S. uranium industry doesn\u2019t want to mine the way that Kazahkstan does. \u201cWe want to protect the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we should be good stewards of the environment.\u201d But that lack of environmental protection in Kazhkstan makes a difference on price \u2014 $10 per pound according to calculations put together by his engineers. Cash framed the 25 percent purchase mandate that he and Goranson have requested as a way to make up for that price difference between the two countries.\n\nOf course, the catch is that while the Ur-Energy and Energy Fuels plan would help prop up the American uranium industry in the short term, it doesn\u2019t account for the fact that the nuclear power industry here isn\u2019t growing. In fact, it\u2019s contracting. The U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s projections for nuclear power demand are even worse than for coal. By 2050, the agency expects the U.S. electric system to use about 20 percent less nuclear power than it did in 2016.

It is the first comic-book movie in decades to have a black protagonist. It was shot by one of the best directors of his generation and with an Oscar-nominated woman behind the camera. It is going to make a ton of money and potentially bust a number of pernicious myths about the international market and movies featuring people of color.\n\nBut I want to talk a little bit about Shuri.\n\nShuri (played by Letitia Wright ) is the sister of T\u2019Challa, the king of Wakanda and the film\u2019s titular character. She oversees the technological operations of the superscientific nation. If you\u2019re comparing T\u2019Challa to James Bond, she\u2019s Q.\n\nShe\u2019s also the funniest character in the movie, steals every scene she\u2019s in and \u2014 for my money \u2014 the most important character.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world. Black people have been historically underrepresented on screen, and black women in strong roles even more so. Shuri provides a science-y role model for black women, a group distinctly underrepresented in STEM fields.\n\nThis potential is essential to the character and factors into Wright\u2019s performance; the actress told Vogue: \u201cI hope it can spark someone to say, \u2018I\u2019m not a superhero, but I can be a scientist or build the next spaceship, like Shuri.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor example, a study titled \u201cIn Pursuit of the MD: The Impact of Role Models, Identity Compatibility, and Belonging Among Undergraduate Women\u201d in the journal Sex Roles found that when women in pre-med programs were exposed to short biographies of five successful female doctors, their interest in a career in medicine shot up (compared with a control group). More interestingly, their sense of belonging in their pre-med programs went up, as did their perception that their gender was compatible with their career aspirations.\n\nMovies can have an even longer lasting impact. A good movie changes the audience, and we have tons of evidence to back that up:\n\nMovies can also have direct, immediate effects on more mundane day-to-day decisions. Attendance at the American Museum of Natural History rose 20 percent after \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d came out, U.S. tourism to New Zealand increased 23 percent after \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d hit theaters, and Croatia\u2019s tourism business has been booming since \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d shot some scenes there. Or, how about this? Drivers seem more prone to speeding after The Fast and the Furious movies are released.\n\nI could go on, but the point is this: On the one hand, sure, movies are a product engineered to optimize financial windfalls for a small group of corporations and intellectual property holders. But on the other hand, I personally got interested in math because of Ian Malcolm, rock-star chaos theory mathematician in \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d and you would not be reading this if not for that.\n\nSo \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a big deal for a lot of reasons, but Shuri is chief among them.", "author": ["Walt Hickey"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-sugar-would-it-take-to-get-a-rocket-to-the-moon/", "published": "2018-02-01T16:25:16", "title": "How Much Sugar Would It Take To Get A Rocket To The Moon?", "text": "The questions that kids ask about science aren\u2019t always easy to answer. Sometimes, their little brains can lead to big places that adults forget to explore. That is what inspired our series Science Question From A Toddler, which uses kids\u2019 curiosity as a jumping-off point to investigate the scientific wonders that adults don\u2019t even think to ask about. The answers are for adults, but they wouldn\u2019t be possible without the wonder that only a child can bring. I want the toddlers in your life to be a part of it! Send me their science questions, and they may serve as the inspiration for a column. And now, our toddler \u2026\n\nHow many cups of sugar would it take to get to the moon? \u2014 Jacob P., age 4.5\n\nI\u2019m going to be upfront here: I chose this particular question because I thought it would be kind of fun to troll some rocket scientists. I figured that asking them this question would be like asking a bunch of engineers about the number of cats that would be required to build the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when Mason Peck, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University, started cheerfully telling me about the sugar-based fuel used to launch homemade rockets. \u201cThere are lots of amateur rocketry people around the world that are interested in wacky propellants,\u201d Peck told me. \u201cAnything with some kind of hydrocarbon in it works pretty well. So obviously sugar would work. Pepperoni works, and it smells delicious by the way.\u201d Yes, seriously.\n\nRockets don\u2019t fly on sugar (or pepperoni) alone, mind you. Instead, the sugar is mixed with potassium nitrate \u2014 a mineral substance that is also used to preserve food and make gunpowder \u2014 to create a pliable mass that can be molded into a shape to fit the rocket before it hardens. The sugar burns and gives the rocket its oomph, and the potassium nitrate feeds oxygen to the sugar that it needs to burn. If you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cOctober Sky,\u201d then you\u2019ve watched fictionalized versions of future NASA rocket scientists build exactly this kind of \u201ccandy\u201d powered rocket. (Since learning that sugar really is relevant to rocketry, we at FiveThirtyEight have begun to wonder whether we are, in fact, the ones being trolled and Jacob P. is secretly a 45-year-old amateur rocketry enthusiast.)\n\nRegardless, this toddler\u2019s question brings up some interesting issues. So, since sugar can launch a rocket, could it actually send an object to the moon? The answer to that question is no, said Katie Robinson, a postdoctoral fellow with the Lunar and Planetary Institute, a NASA-supported research center in Houston. Or, rather, it\u2019s so impractical as to become functionally impossible. And the \u201cwhy\u201d behind that turns out to be deeply relevant \u2014 both to recent advances in space science and our dreams of interplanetary travel.\n\nThat\u2019s because we decide how to power our rockets based not only on a fuel\u2019s ability to burn, but also on how much of it is needed to accelerate a rocket out of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. When we launch anything off the surface of the Earth, the vast majority of what we\u2019re launching is the massive amount of fuel necessary to create the force to break the surly bonds of our planet\u2019s strong gravitational field. \u201cIt\u2019s grossly inefficient,\u201d said Richard Vondrak, a consulting scientist for lunar science and exploration in NASA\u2019s solar system exploration division. \u201cYou\u2019re accelerating a lot of fuel, but burning it up in the process.\u201d\n\nConsider the Apollo program, the NASA project to put a man on the moon. When we sent humans from Earth to the moon, we launched them using the Saturn V \u2014 a skyscraper doubling as a flamethrower that is still the tallest, most powerful rocket to ever fly. When we launched humans from the moon to send them back to Earth, on the other hand, we did it with the lunar module \u2014 a scrappy little vehicle that is the functional (and near literal) equivalent of a wart on Saturn V\u2019s face. The difference in the size of those two vehicles is the necessary result of the difference in the gravitational forces on Earth and the moon. Remember, the force of gravity on the moon is about one-sixth what it is on Earth. Astronauts bounce there. Rocketships soar.\n\nThe great misfortune of Earthling space travel is that we to have to start our travel from Earth. It means we need to carry a lot of fuel, which adds a lot of weight \u2014 and a lot of expense.. It costs about $10,000 to put one pound of payload \u2014 the people, machines, objects and supplies a rocket carries \u2014 into Earth\u2019s orbit. For context, the biggest payload the space shuttle system ever carried was the 50,000-pound Chandra X-ray Observatory, in 1999. Vondrak estimates that it\u2019s probably six times more expensive to send something to the moon. \u201cSo a quart bottle of water is $60,000 \u2014 a dollar for the water and $60,000 for the transportation,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of the expense, it\u2019s important that any rocket fuel we use to leave Earth pack as much punch-per-pound as it can. And that\u2019s why NASA doesn\u2019t launch sugar rockets. Sugar may work fine for amateur rocketry, but compared with professional rocket fuel, it has much less energy in the same amount of space.\n\nRobinson helpfully did the math for me, comparing the energy in white sugar with the energy in the liquid hydrogen and kerosene used in the Saturn V. There are a lot of different ways you could calculate this, she told me, depending on the assumptions you make about the way the different fuels burn. But Robinson said we\u2019d need, oh, 4,753,787 cups of sugar to launch the Saturn V to the moon. And because that sugar doesn\u2019t pack the same energy-to-weight ratio punch as actual rocket fuel, this hypothetical Saturn V would have to carry 285 metric tons more fuel than the real one. \u201cBasically sugar has a lot of energy, but it\u2019s still a lousy rocket fuel,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cLiquid hydrogen is a really good rocket fuel; it only accounts for 13 percent of the fuel by mass on the Saturn V, but accounts for nearly half the total energy produced when that fuel is burned.\u201d\n\nEven with the right fuel, long-distance space travel makes an already inefficient system even more so. Imagine trying to blast off from Earth, travel to Mars, land, launch from there, and travel back again. Now imagine the extra weight and expense of carrying all the fuel necessary for that trip. And that\u2019s why you hear about research into things like space elevators \u2014 a so-far-still-sci-fi system that would carry people, parts, and (yes) fuel into Earth\u2019s orbit by moving a vehicle along a tether between the planet and a geosynchronous space station. A space elevator wouldn\u2019t need rockets, or rocket fuel, and would be 100 percent reusable. But, for now, there\u2019s no material strong enough to build that kind of tether.\n\nInstead, in the near term, our best bet for planet-hopping is to perfect a system that would allow us to make fuel someplace other than Earth. Once you can get your space fuel in space, you wouldn\u2019t need to weigh down an Earth launch with extra gas, and then all kinds of possibilities open up, Peck said. Some ideas for how to do this involve building spaceships that can create their own fuel on board. Peck is part of a team working on one of these projects. The team\u2019s rocket engine uses solar power to create an electric current that can separate a molecule of water into hydrogen and oxygen. Split from their H2O tangle, these elements burn very well. In fact, the combination of liquid hydrogen and oxygen is a common choice for rocket fuel.\n\nPeck\u2019s team has developed a briefcase-sized craft that can fly on their engine. The catch: It has only enough power to fly in space, not launch on its own from Earth. He told me that NASA has agreed to take it into orbit for a test flight, though \u2014 probably sometime in the next couple of years. Even if it can\u2019t launch itself, a ship like this would make it more feasible and a lot cheaper to traverse the solar system.\n\nAnother option, along the same lines, would be to harvest hydrogen and oxygen from another object in space \u2014 the moon, for instance. Not very long ago, Robinson said, this would have sounded insane. When she was an undergrad \u2014 around 2007 \u2014 the idea of water on the moon was rejected out of hand. By the time she was working on her Ph.D., just four years later, water on the moon was a proven fact. How easily this water could be turned into rocket fuel is an open question, Robinson said. Most of the tangled hydrogen and oxygen that has been found is not in a form that most of us would recognize as water. Instead, it\u2019s bound up with the mineral apatite \u2014 microscopic crystals making up 1 percent or 2 percent of a lunar soil sample. And researchers still aren\u2019t sure whether there\u2019s enough of it on the moon to be a fuel source.\n\nThat said, NASA has also found evidence suggesting that there is ice in some of the shadowed craters on the moon\u2019s surface. If that\u2019s true, splitting lunar hydrogen and oxygen into rocket fuel would be much easier. That would be the key to a real, permanent moon base, Robinson said \u2014 a source of not only fuel, but also drinkable water and breathable oxygen.\n\nBut, for now, we\u2019re still struggling with the limitations imposed by what we can carry, and that first step from the ground to the sky remains our biggest hurdle. As long as rocket fuel weighs a lot and takes up a lot of space, anything that makes it easier and cheaper to get into space is a breakthrough.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth-Baker"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/if-you-stop-thinking-of-exercise-as-a-way-to-lose-weight-you-may-actually-enjoy-it/", "published": "2018-01-30T14:00:15", "title": "If You Stop Thinking Of Exercise As A Way To Lose Weight, You May Actually Enjoy It", "text": "For years, I thought of exercise in terms of calories in and calories out: Eat too much pizza on Saturday night, take an extra spin class.

Finally, I decided that just regularly doing something, even if it was only a short run or throwing a few weights around, was better than the all-or-nothing cycle I\u2019d settled into. Running 20 minutes most days of the work week didn\u2019t feel like a big burden, but it added up to much more exercise than one failed attempt to run for 50 minutes every two weeks. As it turns out, my shorter routine was already pretty much meeting the recommendations for preventing heart disease, diabetes, cancer and early death. And because I knew my new regimen wasn\u2019t burning a ton of calories, I started paying more attention to my eating habits. Exercise became a way to achieve better health, not control my weight.\n\nThis shift in thinking has profoundly changed my life. When I stopped leaning on exercise to save myself from my dietary habits, it became more fun and doable.\n\nI had visions of a self-help book empire based on this insight, but alas, it turns out I wasn\u2019t the first to have it. Yoni Freedhoff, a family physician and medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute in Ottawa, has spent years pushing for \u201cdetaching exercise from weight loss and reattaching it to health.\u201d As he likes to say, regular exercise is the single best thing you can do for your health. Evidence suggests that it can lower cholesterol and blood pressure, reduce deaths from heart disease, prevent and treat Type 2 diabetes, improve respiratory fitness in people with asthma, and help with depression, among other things. As many experts have observed, if exercise were a pill, it would be the most beneficial medication on the market.\n\nYet despite all its health benefits, exercise is not a particularly effective tool for weight loss. One review from 2014 found that unless you\u2019re doing an awful lot of aerobic exercise, you\u2019re not likely to lose a lot of weight. Without caloric restriction, most people who are overweight and obese can expect to lose up to about 4 pounds with exercise, the authors wrote. That\u2019s not the same as saying it\u2019s totally useless \u2014 it isn\u2019t. It appears to help, albeit modestly, lessen weight gain over the long term. And it seems to reduce the chances that lost weight will creep back.\n\nBut we actually don\u2019t burn a ton of calories when we exercise, Freedhoff said. If we did, we wouldn\u2019t have survived as a species during the majority of human history when calories were scarce. That\u2019s especially true in relation to the food we eat. For example, a 155-pound person burns 298 calories in 30 minutes of running at a 12-minute-mile pace. But the same person burns 42 calories in a half-hour of sitting around reading a book, so the net burn is closer to 256. That barely covers a half-cup of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, depending on the flavor.\n\nThere are also studies suggesting that even when we increase activity, our overall caloric expenditure holds steady, for reasons not fully understood. Perhaps we unconsciously compensate for workouts by being less active during the rest of the day. Of course, there will always be exceptions, but in general, exercise has a \u201cdisappointing\u201d influence on weight, Freedhoff said.\n\nIf you\u2019re exercising with the expectation that you\u2019ll lose weight, you may be discouraged and tempted to quit when the pounds don\u2019t peel off, he said. There is even research suggesting that people who believe obesity is caused by a lack of exercise rather than a poor diet are more likely to be overweight and to eat more.\n\nOn the other hand, if your goal is general health, there is plenty of evidence that exercise is effective. Public health groups, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine, are in consensus: Aim for a minimum of about 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking; 75 per week of more intense exercise, such as running, aerobics or fast cycling; or some combination of the two.\n\nWhy 150 minutes? \u201cIt\u2019s the magic number because according to the epidemiological research, that\u2019s the critical point where you start to see more substantial changes in the risk of disease and mortality,\u201d said Carol Ewing Garber, a professor of movement sciences at Columbia University and an author of the ACSM\u2019s guidelines. There\u2019s a benefit at lower levels of activity \u2014 something is definitely better than nothing \u2014 but the 150-minute-mark weekly is where you start getting a better bang for your buck, she said.\n\nPublic health groups also recommend regular strength and flexibility training, something that I had a much easier time fitting in when I wasn\u2019t trying to aerobicize myself into a smaller pants size. Strength training is particularly important to fight off the loss of muscle mass as you age.\n\nOf course, public health recommendations for entire populations aren\u2019t going to fit everyone. Individual response to exercise varies, and some people need more than others to get to the same level of fitness, Garber said. And diseases may require different amounts of exercise for prevention. A meta-analysis published in 2015 suggested that to substantially lower the risk of heart failure, people needed to exercise two or four times the current public-health recommendations. Again, though, even though \u201cmore is consistently better\u201d with heart failure prevention, anything is better than nothing, said Ambarish Pandey, a cardiology fellow at UT Southwestern Medical Center and an author of the study.\n\nMore exercise than the minimum is definitely associated with \u201cadditional and more extensive health benefits,\u201d according to the CDC. So if you\u2019re happily exercising beyond the current recs, great! But that\u2019s not strictly necessary: You can do something really great for your health by simply meeting the exercise guidelines, even it it\u2019s not the best way to tackle your weight. If you\u2019re like me, that reframing may even make exercise more pleasant and rewarding.", "author": ["Katherine Hobson"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/to-combat-female-genital-cutting-in-the-u-s-we-need-more-information/", "published": "2018-01-23T11:00:14", "title": "To Combat Female Genital Cutting In The U.S., We Need More Information", "text": "Female genital mutilation was criminalized in the U.S. more than 20 years ago, but the first major criminal prosecution related to the procedure is only unfolding now. Dr. Jumana Nagarwala will appear Tuesday in federal court in Michigan for a hearing related to her bail conditions. Seven additional defendants \u2014 including another doctor \u2014 have been charged with assisting Nagarwala, a U.S.-educated emergency physician, in a 12-year conspiracy to cut the genitals of prepubescent girls as part of a religious ritual.\n\nThe case is shedding light on a procedure that remains little understood in the U.S. \u2014 in part because we don\u2019t know how widely it\u2019s practiced. Female genital mutilation (also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision) is an umbrella term for the ritual, medically unnecessary excision of part or all of a girl\u2019s external genitalia. It can refer to several different types of cuts, all which are associated with negative health consequences \u2014 including difficulty urinating, reduced sexual pleasure, serious infections and complications in childbirth \u2014 and it is recognized by international groups like the World Health Organization as a human rights violation. The practice is justified for a variety of reasons, including religion, cleanliness, preservation of virginity by reducing sexual desire or as rite of passage to womanhood.\n\nFemale genital cutting has been documented in communities across Africa, the Middle East and Asia, including among the Dawoodi Bohras, the Indian Shiite Muslim sect to which Nagarwala belongs. The WHO estimates that more than 200 million girls and women have undergone the practice in the places where it\u2019s common, and more than 3 million girls are at risk of the procedure each year. But the global data on female genital mutilation is incomplete: There has been research on the practice in Africa, where it\u2019s believed to be most common, since the late 1980s, but other countries like Indonesia have only recently begun to investigate it via surveys.\n\nThis is problematic for the U.S., which made the genital cutting of female minors illegal in 1996 but doesn\u2019t conduct its own surveys on the procedure\u2019s prevalence. Collecting the data is difficult, and the issue hasn\u2019t historically been a public health priority in the U.S. Instead, government agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rely on data collected abroad and immigration rates from countries where the practice is common to estimate the number of women and girls who may be at risk. The lack of data means that advocates and government agencies don\u2019t know where prevention resources are needed, clinicians don\u2019t know which patient populations are most at risk or which kinds of cutting are most prevalent, and the problem continues to be perceived as one that primarily affects other countries.\n\nThe most recent U.S. estimate \u2014 which doesn\u2019t even try to quantify the number of women and girls who have undergone the procedure \u2014 concluded that as of 2012, there were approximately 513,000 women and girls at risk of genital mutilation \u2014 more than three times higher than estimates from 1990. But that number should be taken with a big grain of salt, according to CDC epidemiologist Thomas Clark. For example, the data doesn\u2019t account for immigrants from countries where female genital cutting isn\u2019t studied or widely practiced. That means, for example, that the Dawoodi Bohra aren\u2019t part of the estimate; even though female genital cutting appears to be widely practiced in their community, the Bohras make up a very small part of the Indian population, so India isn\u2019t one of the countries in the estimate.\n\n\u201cYou also can\u2019t assume that people who come to the U.S. are a representative sample of their country of origin,\u201d Clark said. That\u2019s especially problematic for estimating rates of female genital cutting, since it\u2019s not practiced uniformly within countries. It\u2019s also possible, he said, that some immigrants abandon the procedure as they assimilate. Awareness that the practice is illegal in the U.S. may be an additional deterrent, although it\u2019s also illegal in many African countries.\n\nAnd some advocates point out that although the estimates focus on immigrants, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that female genital cutting isn\u2019t new to the U.S. Female circumcision was performed as a treatment for masturbation by American physicians as recently as the mid-20th century; to bring attention to this history, a white woman from Minnesota named Renee Bergstrom wrote an essay in the Guardian about the removal of her clitoris by a Christian doctor in a church clinic when she was a young girl.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a problem that immigrants are bringing here,\u201d said Shelby Quast, the director of the Americas office of Equality Now, a global nonprofit focusing on women\u2019s rights.\n\nWithout accurate data, it\u2019s hard to launch prevention efforts or provide resources to affected women and girls. But gathering information about a secretive procedure believed to be concentrated among tightly knit immigrant communities remains difficult. That problem is compounded by the fact that although cutting is practiced by a number of different religious groups, Muslims like Mariya Taher \u2014 the co-founder of Sahiyo, a Bohra anti-cutting group \u2014 have said they have been reluctant to to speak out because they worry that openly discussing the practice may encourage anti-Islam legislation and rhetoric. (Female genital mutilation has no scriptural basis in either Islam or Christianity.)\n\nGhada Khan, a Ph.D. student and researcher at George Washington University who is currently conducting qualitative research on female genital cutting in the Washington, D.C., area, said she\u2019s received pushback from Muslim community members with such concerns. It\u2019s not an unjustified fear: In response to Nagarwala\u2019s arrest, a Michigan lawmaker introduced a bill that would ban residents from using Sharia law in state courts.\n\nBut Khan thinks that better data collection could actually help combat the idea that female genital cutting is a Muslim ritual by showing that it\u2019s practiced across religious and ethnic boundaries. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s a religious practice, but all of their justifications are cultural \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally about controlling a woman\u2019s sexuality,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to recognize that when you see how many different groups are practicing it, from many different parts of the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough research on the practice has become more of a U.S. priority in recent years, there aren\u2019t many good ways of obtaining information about its prevalence. Because the number of women and girls at risk in the U.S. is small within the context of the millions of women and girls in the country overall, adding questions about female cutting to population-wide health surveys \u2014 which draw from small samples \u2014 wouldn\u2019t give researchers a good sense of how common it is, according to Clark.\n\nAnother option would be to conduct targeted surveys in immigrant groups where prevalence might be high. These wouldn\u2019t provide a comprehensive snapshot of how common the procedure is overall, but it would offer researchers and clinicians more information about communities\u2019 perspectives on it and whether people are continuing to engage in the ritual after moving to the U.S., Clark said. That, in turn, would make it easier to target resources to addressing the issue \u2014 and help health care providers identify the cuts their patients have been subjected to.\n\nSuch efforts would also be an important complement to litigation like the Nagarwala case, according to Taher. \u201cWe need to make sure people are being held legally accountable, but the law alone can\u2019t change community perceptions or help victims heal,\u201d she said.", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-competency-test-for-trump-could-be-a-bad-idea/", "published": "2018-01-12T16:16:01", "title": "A Competency Test For Trump Could Be A Bad Idea", "text": "Doctors, lawyers and soldiers have to prove that they\u2019re mentally competent to do their jobs. Should the president?\n\nThat\u2019s what Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, proposed on Tuesday, when he introduced a bill that would require the president-elect to pass a physical and mental medical examination before swearing in. Although written to broadly encompass anyone elected to the nation\u2019s highest office, the bill is clearly aimed at President Trump. It\u2019s even named after one of the president\u2019s recent tweets: the Standardizing Testing and Accountability Before Large Elections Giving Electors Necessary Information for Unobstructed Selection Act. (That\u2019s STABLE GENIUS in acronymese.)\n\nTrump\u2019s mental health has been the talk of Washington for more than a year \u2014 mental health professionals have offered long-distance personality evaluations, there have been suggestions that Congress could invoke the 25th Amendment, and the public has debated whether the president shows signs of age-related cognitive decline. But the conversation reached fever pitch this past week after the publication of Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\u201d\n\nWe are not here to adjudicate whether Trump is mentally ill, suffering from dementia or otherwise mentally incapacitated. (We do, though, have thoughts about whether it\u2019s appropriate to discuss the matter.) Instead, we\u2019re seeking to better understand whether it\u2019s practical to screen a president for mental competency. For answers, we turned to law, medicine and the military \u2014 other industries where a person\u2019s personal stability can have big impacts on the safety of others. Sure enough, evaluations like the one proposed by Boyle are done routinely in some of these other professions. But comparing how mental health is handled in these different jobs also demonstrates why transferring other industries\u2019 norms wouldn\u2019t be easy \u2014 or even desirable.\n\nThere are tests for mental competency before someone can become a doctor, a lawyer or a soldier. The specifics vary by state for lawyers and by specialty for medicine and the military.\n\nAll of them are broad entrance examinations, focused on whether a potential lawyer, doctor or soldier can do the job that they are proposing to take on. For example, to become a lawyer in Illinois, you have to pass a character and fitness review. Applicants fill out documents, including character references and medical history questionnaires, which are reviewed by five different committees, said Jayne Reardon, executive director of the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on Professionalism. If those committees think an applicant needs additional scrutiny, they can choose to hold a hearing. \u201cIt can be an adversarial process where the applicant gets a lawyer to represent them,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd that process doesn\u2019t end once you\u2019re part of the club. Surgeons, for instance, undergo a review every two years by whatever hospital they are credentialed to work at, which basically serves as a broad professional check-up, said David Welsh, a surgeon and a member of the board of governors of the American College of Surgeons. Meanwhile, drill instructors in the military get mental health-specific evaluations annually because their jobs are so psychologically demanding, said Craig Bryan, a psychologist and executive director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah.\n\nThough the specifics of these institutional systems vary, there are a few similarities that could help shape a hypothetical presidential screening. First, all three professions are focused on behavior and potential performance on the job, not on whether someone has been diagnosed with a mental illness or personality disorder, or has reached a specific age. Someone with bipolar disorder, for instance, could still pass the fitness reviews Reardon described and become a lawyer \u2014 although, depending on their personal medical history, they might end up with a conditional license that requires them to keep taking their prescribed medication to remain one.\n\nAll these testing systems are also universally applied. While some individuals might end up receiving a higher-than-normal level of scrutiny, there\u2019s a basic level of testing that everybody in these professions has to take. Everyone is treated the same. No one is assumed to be A-OK and given a free pass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very delicate balance because (people with mental health issues) have rights too,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cBut their rights end where the clients are not being protected.\u201d\n\nThis balance is thought about a little differently in the corporate world, where it\u2019s common to use tests of personality to screen people for jobs. But that\u2019s usually implemented on a company-by-company basis, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership practice at the Yale School of Management.\n\nThere\u2019s no universal entrance examination that licenses people to become corporate executives or members or a board of directors. And while Sonnenfeld said that can create risks, he was also opposed to implementing something like the universal screenings used in law, medicine and the military. The corporate world has relied, to varying degrees, on personality and mental competency tests as a filter in hiring and promotions for decades. But those tests have often proven to be scientifically flawed and bad for corporate culture. \u201cIn France they have handwriting analysis and even had phrenology in use until quite recently,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. Neither of those systems is a scientifically valid way of learning about human personality and behavior. Meanwhile, the personality tests commonly used by U.S. companies can end up accidentally incentivizing a conformist workplace or scientifically enforcing discrimination against minorities and people with disabilities.\n\nRegardless of the test, the interpretation of the results is just as important as the way they\u2019re gathered. These concerns \u2014 whether the metrics being employed to test someone\u2019s mental competency are valid and whether the results are being interpreted in a way that is both fair for individuals and good for the institution \u2014 were shared by Elizabeth Suhay, a professor of government at American University whose work involves the interactions between science and politics. She was troubled by the idea of instituting a competency test for the presidency, especially in a polarized political climate. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming pretty obvious to everybody that people are able to politicize facts just as much as values,\u201d Suhay said.\n\nShe drew a corollary to the impeachment process, which effectively allows Congress to define what counts as \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Impeachment is an open, democratic process, Suhay said. But it leaves a lot of room for politicization in the definition of what is a problem and what isn\u2019t. A mental competency test for the presidency would likely do the same. But because it would come with a veneer of science, in the form of test results, it could carry a false sense of certainty and objectivity.\n\nBut the stakes are high, she said. If you make the presidency dependent on passing a mental health test of some sort, you could end up undermining the foundations of democracy as people find ways to use the test to prevent opponents from running. At the same time, most voters don\u2019t have transparent information about a candidate\u2019s mental health. Both the risks to democracy and the risks of an incompetent president are real.", "author": ["Maggie Koerth-Baker"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-wellness-habits-we-love-too-much-to-investigate/", "published": "2018-01-08T15:00:09", "title": "The Wellness Habits We Love Too Much To Investigate", "text": "FiveThirtyEight spent last week writing about our science resolutions for the new year, testing whether our habits and hobbies are backed by evidence.

But I always drink a full glass of water before I pee, out of some notion that I\u2019m somehow preserving my overall hydration. I doubt this is scientifically sound, and sometimes it\u2019s really hard to pull off (because I really, really need to pee), but I\u2019m sticking with it.\n\nElla Koeze, visual journalist: Years ago, an aunt told me that my blood type meant my ancestors were \u201cherders\u201d and my body is best suited to consuming dairy.

On Wednesday, a new one was. The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, an organization devoted to doing exactly what its name suggests, announced that it had discovered a new prime number, the largest ever found: \\(2^{77,232,917}-1\\). That\u2019s more than 77 million 2s all multiplied together, minus 1. I\u2019d write it all out for you, but there\u2019s a big problem: It\u2019s 23,249,425 digits long. (So, it goes by its nickname: M77232917.)\n\nInstead of writing it out, I\u2019ll offer this chart, which shows how long the longest known prime has been over time. (We\u2019ve charted it on a log scale so we can more easily compare the huge range of numbers.)\n\nA prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and one. These numbers play an important role in pure mathematics and its field of number theory. Emphasis on pure. The British mathematician G. H. Hardy once proudly wrote that number theory was so free of practical application that \u201cno one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers.\u201d (That has changed recently, however, as primes now play an important role in cryptography.)\n\nMathematicians have been searching for primes for centuries, often with no more than a quill and a brain. By 1588, an Italian mathematician had proved that 524,287, or \\(2^{19}-1\\), was prime. By 1772, the legendary Leonhard Euler had shown that 2,147,483,647, or \\(2^{31}-1\\), was, too.\n\nThen came the computer. You can clearly see the dawn of the computer age in the chart above. Over the course of the past 70 years or so, the longest known prime has become thousands and thousands of times longer. Supercomputers have been a boon for prime hunters. The discovery of longer primes has gone hand in hand with the development of faster and more powerful processors.\n\nToday, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search project relies on distributed computing to hunt its mammoths. As with similar projects for folding proteins or searching for extraterrestrials, volunteers download custom prime-searching software and donate their spare computing power to the project. One such volunteer, Jonathan Pace, discovered M77232917 on his machine the day after Christmas. He\u2019d been searching for 14 years. It took six days to prove that the number was indeed prime.\n\nM77232917 is certainly not the largest prime number. In fact, there is no largest prime number. There are infinitely many \u2014 a fact established by the Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 B.C. Fascinating open questions about prime numbers do remain, such as the Goldbach conjecture (which wonders if every even integer above two can be expressed as the sum of two primes) and a twin prime conjecture (which wonders if there are an infinite number of pairs of primes separated by 2, like 11 and 13).\n\nBut finding an even more enormous prime won\u2019t prove these mathematical ideas. So why hunt? Reasons provided by the prime search project include tradition, collection, glory and money. It lists a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime.

Throughout the week, we\u2019ve been questioning whether some of our habits and hobbies are based on junk science or real evidence. Here\u2019s the fourth entry, on the merits of mindfulness.\n\nSometime around, oh, my 60th panic attack last year, I figured it was time to see a therapist. On top of weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy, she mentioned that I should really try this mindfulness thing people keep talking about. It sounded simple \u2014 you sit, you concentrate on your breathing, and you try to find some solace in the modern world. My therapist told me that meditation could make me feel better and that it had been shown to change the physiology of the brain.\n\nHmmmm, I thought.\n\nSkepticism is a FiveThirtyEight staffer\u2019s currency. The only mantras we chant around the office are: Wait for the evidence; wonder if the evidence has something wrong with it; trust the good evidence only until better evidence comes along. I was especially distrustful because mindfulness and meditation have been having a moment \u2014 meditation apps occupy some of the top spots on the App Store\u2019s rankings of most popular health and fitness apps; Anderson Cooper has profiled the merits of mindfulness on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d; mindfulness is being used in schools as a way to help manage classrooms. Given the hype and this publication\u2019s natural aversion to health trends, I figured I was safe disregarding my therapist\u2019s big claims.\n\nOne can overcommit to skepticism, just as one can overcommit to certainty.\n\nBut as FiveThirtyEight\u2019s science team assembled the junk science we wanted to shed in 2018, I started to wonder whether mindfulness really was bunk. So I dove into the scientific literature and discovered I was wrong: There is some limited evidence to suggest that meditation might help with some ailments and may produce measurable changes in the brain. It\u2019s no miracle cure, and there\u2019s still a lot of science left to do, especially about the kind of casual meditation people may fit into a busy day. But in my rush to doubt my therapist\u2019s advice, I forgot that skepticism can sometimes be as flawed as the science it seeks to temper.\n\nWestern researchers have been thinking empirically about the efficacy of meditation only for a few decades, and they largely study it in two ways: how subjects say meditation makes them feel and how it might shape the brain. Importantly, meditation can be any of a number of things \u2014 a focus on breath, a silent chanting of a mantra, a focus on feelings of love and kindness \u2014 and it\u2019s still unclear whether some types of meditation are more effective than others.\n\nThat creates a problem for the science, since it\u2019s difficult to draw broad conclusions if different trials all test for the effects of \u201cmindfulness\u201d but don\u2019t treat \u201cmindfulness\u201d as the same thing. \u201cIt\u2019s this loose enough definition that it allows for anyone to say what they\u2019re doing is mindfulness,\u201d said Nicholas Van Dam, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne and one of the authors of a new paper about the limitations of mindfulness science. What\u2019s more, the mindfulness regimens that researchers study are likely very different from what you\u2019d casually do at home. Apps like Headspace, which offers as little as three minutes a day of directed meditation, are a far cry from the eight-week, 20-plus-hour mindfulness training that is used in the best studies.\n\nWith all those caveats on the record, let\u2019s look at what we do know.\n\nIn 2014, a team of researchers led by Madhav Goyal, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, put together a meta-analysis of 47 trials featuring 3,515 participants and examined whether meditation consistently helped various ailments. The meta-analysis, which was published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, mostly came up empty \u2014 there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence in the scientific literature to say for sure that meditation had an effect on, say, sleep problems, substance abuse or inattentiveness.\n\nStill, a few benefits did emerge. Subjects in several studies reported being less anxious, feeling less depressed and suffering through less physical pain than before they began a mindfulness-based stress reduction program, compared with participants who received no structured therapy. The effect wasn\u2019t huge, but it was there.\n\nFor the anxious, depressed or pained among us \u2014 so, all of us? \u2014 that seems like promising news. But it\u2019s important to note that there was not evidence that mindfulness was superior to other treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral group therapy or progressive muscle relaxation.\n\nMeditation\u2019s effect on the brain is similarly promising but preliminary. Studies show a consistent trend that meditation can alter brain structure. A 2016 meta-analysis of 30 studies in the journal Brain and Cognition showed that mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques stimulated development in areas of the brain related to regulating attention and keeping perspective on a situation. It also found changes in the participants\u2019 amygdalae indicative of an improved ability to regulate emotions. In 2014, a different meta-analysis published in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews also found structural changes in participants\u2019 brains after they meditated.\n\nStill, scientists urge caution when interpreting the results. The 2014 meta-analysis was careful to note that \u201cany firm claims about whether meditation truly causes differences in brain structure are still premature.\u201d Mindfulness research is also easily misrepresented. In 2005, Sara Lazar, a professor at Harvard and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, and others published a study that found differences in the brains of people who practice mindfulness, compared with those who don\u2019t. But that\u2019s all it showed \u2014 not that mindfulness caused differences in brain chemistry. Since then, Lazar said, the science has reached the point where we can show that meditation has a direct effect. But her experience is a reminder that mindfulness science can fall victim to the media hype cycle.\n\nSo where does all this leave a skeptic like me? I\u2019ve tried mindfulness, and I think it has plenty to teach me about how to fight life\u2019s undertow and come up for air. Still, I\u2019m unlikely to fold mindfulness into my own routine. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has made my panic attacks almost nonexistent, and the science doesn\u2019t suggest that mindfulness as a dedicated practice is necessarily better than talk therapy anyway. Plus, it\u2019s not clear that the brief, app-led mindfulness I\u2019d do at home would replicate the longer, more integrated mindfulness that most studies have tested.\n\nBut after looking at the research, I\u2019ve come to realize that my dismissal of mindfulness was premature \u2014 and likely informed by my own biases against any number of things: science fads, non-Western medicine, things that could actually make me stop having panic attacks, etc.\n\nAnd so I\u2019m also taking away another lesson: that one can overcommit to skepticism, just as one can overcommit to certainty. In my research for this article, I came across an interview with Catherine Kerr, a neuroscience researcher who died in 2016: \u201cThe mistake is investing 100-percent certainty in a result and not holding a probabilistic view of scientific truth or risk and benefit. When people are making decisions for their own well-being, they need to hold that uncertainty in mind.\u201d The same goes for investing 0-percent certainty in something. When I took a breath and stepped outside my normal thought process, I gained a different perspective.

Throughout the week, we\u2019ll be writing about our resolutions for the new year. Here\u2019s the second entry, on Tom Brady\u2019s fitness empire.\n\nI am done with testimonials from professional athletes. I\u2019ve spent the last year and a half reporting and writing a book about exercise recovery , and what I\u2019ve learned is that advice from elite athletes is often cluttered with pseudoscientific explanations for their stupendous results. The problem is that gifted athletes don\u2019t necessarily know how they got that way. Or, in the words of David Epstein, author of \u201cThe Sports Gene,\u201d \u201cJust because you\u2019re a bird doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an ornithologist.\u201d\n\nTake New England Patriots quarterback and five-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, for instance. He\u2019s still playing at 40, a geriatric age in the NFL. What keeps him performing at such a high level all these years? It could be that he\u2019s blessed with a strong arm and a sturdy frame, or that the Patriots\u2019s strong offensive line has (mostly) protected him from sacks and related injuries.\n\nBut Brady has his own theories. He attributes his athletic longevity to a list of 12 principles outlined in his best-selling 2017 book, \u201cThe TB12 Method.\u201d (Twelve is an important number to Brady; it\u2019s not only the number on his jersey, but also the brand on the many products he sells to his fans). The TB12 principles include generic advice like \u201cfeeling better \u2014 that\u2019s the key\u201d and \u201cbalance and moderation in all things.\u201d\n\nModeration in all things, that is, except when it comes to water. \u201cSometimes I think I\u2019m the most hydrated person in the world,\u201d Brady writes after advising readers to drink at least one half of their body weight in ounces of water every day. \u201cAt 225 pounds, that means I should be drinking 112 ounces a day, minimum,\u201d he says. If you don\u2019t drink enough, he claims, you decrease the oxygen in your bloodstream, build up toxins in your cells and create an \u201cunhealthy inner environment,\u201d whatever that means. (Brady also contends that \u201cthe more hydrated I am, the less likely I am to get sunburned,\u201d a claim disputed by scientists.)\n\nWater alone isn\u2019t enough though. Brady also relies on TB12\u2122 Electrolytes, \u201ca natural mineral concentrate that enable athletes to turn any liquid into a hydrating sports drink enriched with 72 trace minerals extracted from sea water.\u201d (Curiously, the product packaging lists only 17 ingredients.) Who doesn\u2019t love guzzling sea-water extract?\n\nElectrolytes, though, aren\u2019t anything special. They\u2019re simply salts and minerals. \u201cThey\u2019re brilliant marketing,\u201d exercise scientist Tamara Hew-Butler at Oakland University told me. Sodium and potassium are the major ones we need, and your body maintains stores of them that it can tap into as needed to protect your body\u2019s normal functioning. \u201cYou have a lot of redundancy in the feedback systems to protect their levels,\u201d she said. Unless you\u2019re exercising continuously in excess of 18 hours or more, you normally make up for any loss through the food you eat in your next meal. Despite all the hoopla about their presence in sports drinks and fancy bottled waters, there\u2019s no need to take them in supplements or some special formula.\n\nDrinking excessive amounts of water when you\u2019re not thirsty isn\u2019t just dumb, it\u2019s dangerous, because it can produce a potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia, or \u201cwater intoxication.\u201d Despite the marketing campaigns of bottled water makers and sports drink manufacturers, there\u2019s no good science to show that athletes or anyone else needs to drink beyond thirst, which is your body\u2019s natural way of telling you to drink, just like hunger means you need to eat. But there\u2019s plenty of good evidence that drinking too much can kill you. Hyponatremia happens when the blood becomes dangerously diluted, which can lead to symptoms that look a lot like dehydration \u2014 such as fatigue, headache, confusion and weakness. In the most serious cases, it can provoke brain swelling, coma and even death. I have been unable to find a single case of a football player collapsing and dying from dehydration on the field , but at least two high school football players have died from hyponatremia. Yet Brady says that underhydration is a greater problem than overhydration.\n\nBut wait \u2014 there\u2019s more! Brady also recommends a restricted diet that, among other things, avoids nightshades and favors \u201calkaline\u201d foods, which he says, without presenting any evidence, reduce inflammation. (The diet is apparently outlined in greater detail in the TB12 Nutrition Manual, which sells for $200.)\n\nFor every bit of advice, there\u2019s a product for sale. In addition to the electrolytes and rollers and stretchy bands, there\u2019s a protein powder that he just happens to sell, and a brain training app that you can subscribe to for $14 a month (or $96 for a year).\n\nBrady credits his athletic longevity to something called \u201cmuscle pliability,\u201d a term invented by his \u201cbody coach,\u201d Alex Guerrero, a man twice investigated by government regulators for misrepresenting himself as a doctor (he\u2019s not) and falsely asserting that one supplement he was shilling had been clinically tested and proven to cure cancer, Parkinson\u2019s, AIDS and other diseases and that another, which Brady once endorsed, could prevent concussions.\n\nWhat\u2019s muscle pliability? \u201cPliability is the name Alex and I give to the training regimen he and I do every day. Using his hands and elbows, Alex performs targeted, deep-force muscle work to lengthen and soften every muscle of my body, as I rhythmically contract and relax that muscle,\u201d Brady writes in his book. It may sound like massage, but Brady insists it\u2019s something different. (The best part of inventing your own word is that you can make it mean whatever you want it to.) \u201cThe goal of pliability is to reeducate your brain-body connection, which continually sends messages to your muscles to stay long, soft, and primed,\u201d he writes, adding that you can think of it as the \u201cnew \u2018warm-up\u2019 and \u2018cool-down.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe book illustrates a series of exercises and self-massages that Brady promises will make muscles less tight, dense, stiff and injury-prone. Do the muscle pliability exercises in his book do what they advertise? It\u2019s hard to say, because the only evidence provided is Brady\u2019s testimonials, and there\u2019s no actual scientific research on this stuff. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re trying to say with that,\u201d said Keith Baar, a physiologist who studies muscles and exercise at the University of California, Davis. University of Kentucky muscle physiologist Tim Butterfield told me that he\u2019d never heard the term pliability used in muscle research. To test Brady\u2019s claims yourself, you\u2019ll have to buy some TB12 vibrating foam rollers or, better yet, hire a TB12-certified body coach. \u201cI want to make it very clear that the best method of achieving optimal pliability is through a certified TB12 body coach,\u201d Brady writes.\n\nMaybe he really believes in this stuff, but after reading all 303 pages of Brady\u2019s book, I can\u2019t help noticing how much of his recommendations sound like advertising. For every bit of advice, there\u2019s a product for sale. In addition to the electrolytes and rollers and stretchy bands, there\u2019s a protein powder that he just happens to sell, and a brain training app that you can subscribe to for $14 a month (or $96 for a year).\n\nBrady has faced criticism for his association with Guerrero, and Patriots coach Bill Belichick is reported to be distancing his team from the disgraced guru, but it\u2019s easy to see what Brady sees in the guy. Brady might well be the greatest quarterback in NFL history, and Guerrero has taught him how to turn that on-field r\u00e9sum\u00e9 into an off-field wellness empire.\n\nCORRECTION (Jan. 3, 2018, 2:38 p.m.): An earlier version of this story missidentified sodium and potassium as molecules.

Leona Helmsley was, too. But gangsters and entitled millionaires aren\u2019t the only ones who hold something back from the tax man. Each year, Americans of all stripes underpay the IRS by hundreds of billions, aided by the fact that the agency lacks the resources to catch all the cheaters.\n\nRecently, tax dodging has found a new champion: liberal state governments fighting back against the Republicans\u2019 far-reaching tax reforms, which seem to hit a number of blue states particularly hard. New Jersey and California want to reclassify certain state and local taxes as tax-exempt charitable donations, while New York might swap the state\u2019s income tax for a deductible payroll tax, among other ideas under consideration. There\u2019s little doubt about the underlying goal of these potential changes, nicely summarized by Connecticut\u2019s state revenue commissioner when he called his state\u2019s plan a \u201cbit of payback for what I think was the utter disregard of the Congress for the impact of this on states like Connecticut.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have long blessed other ways of avoiding paying taxes. When Hillary Clinton challenged then-candidate Donald Trump during the first presidential debate for not paying income taxes, he responded: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d And by cutting funding for audits and enforcement, his party has made it easier for people and companies to fudge their returns.\n\nThe bipartisan flirtation with avoiding taxes, through both legal and illegal means, threatens a tax system that is already bringing in historically low levels of revenue and that pays for everything from social security to military preparedness. Three foes in particular are enabling tax dodgers, making their ploys more common and more damaging: reduced support for the IRS, new incentives for people to become cheaters and widening partisan distrust.\n\nFoe No. 1: A weakened IRS\n\nThere may be no purer example of D.C. dysfunction than the effort to underfund the IRS. That\u2019s because the IRS isn\u2019t like other agencies; when you cut its funding, you actually lose money.\n\nEvery dollar devoted to the IRS budget generates four to five dollars in new revenue, according to statements and congressional testimony from former IRS chief John Koskinen. That\u2019s because a portion of each dollar goes to paying auditors, updating computer tracking systems and otherwise expanding the agency\u2019s ability to collect unreported money from taxpayers.\n\nWhile this argument may sound self-serving coming from the head of the IRS, recent history seems to confirm Koskinen\u2019s view. IRS funding has been cut substantially in recent years, from over $13 billion in 2010 to roughly $11 billion in 2016. And those cuts have set off a chain reaction of underenforcement and undercollection \u2014 including a 30 percent cut in \u201ckey enforcement occupations,\u201d which has translated into fewer audits.\n\nSpecifically, that $2.2 billion funding cut between 2010 and 2016 coincided with an $8.6 billion decline in revenue from audits and investigations.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this figure may actually understate the real losses because audits also have spillover effects. After being audited, tax filers tend to change their behavior, increasing compliance to avoid future investigations, according to a study conducted in Denmark. Recent research has also found that when businesses are visited directly by the IRS, other firms who use the same tax preparer also pay slightly more in taxes. With fewer IRS agents taking to the field, these indirect benefits don\u2019t accrue.\n\nFoe No. 2: Small businesses cheat, and tax reform fosters them\n\nTax evasion isn\u2019t for everyone. Salaried workers who get regular paychecks and a W-2 form have fewer opportunities for it. The IRS simply knows too much about their pay, having gotten regular updates from their employer \u2014 not to mention regular payments via withholding.\n\nInstead, the biggest cheaters are the ones for whom it\u2019s easiest. And that tends to be on the business side, with an outsize role for smaller and less bureaucratic outfits \u2014 particularly small shops with single owners, self-employed freelance consultants and other independent contractors.\n\nIn these businesses (whose owners are generally referred to as \u201csole proprietors\u201d or \u201cnonfarm proprietors\u201d), the people earning the income are the same ones who decide what information to share with the IRS. There is no third party \u2014 an employer or investment manager \u2014 to pass those details along in a non-self-interested way. And while the owner-workers are still expected to report every dollar they get from clients, along with a fair accounting of appropriate deductions, that doesn\u2019t always happen.\n\nThe effect can be dramatic. The IRS regularly performs a \u201ctax gap\u201d analysis \u2014 comparing tax filings against census and other third-party data to estimate underreported and missing income. In 2008-2010, the most recent period for which the IRS has published this analysis, nonfarm proprietors underreported their taxable incomes by an average of 64 percent. And while they accounted for around 15 percent of all individual income tax returns, they were responsible for nearly 30 percent of all underreported dollars.\n\nThe biggest tax evaders are those with the least oversight Estimated underreported taxable income* by income type, 2008-10 Amount of third-party information Income type Share of tax liabilities misreported Little or none Farm income 71% \u2013 Nonfarm proprietor income 64 \u2013 Rents and royalties 62 \u2013 Other income 49 \u2013 Form 4797 income 42 \u2013 Some Capital gains 27 \u2013 Partnership, S-corp, etc. 16 \u2013 Substantial Taxable Social Security benefits 19 \u2013 State income tax refunds 13 \u2013 Dividend income 7 \u2013 Unemployment compensation 6 \u2013 Pensions and annuities 4 \u2013 Interest income 3 \u2013 Wages, salaries, tips 1 \u2013 * Net misreported amount divided by the sum of the absolute values of the amounts that should have\n\nbeen reported. Source: IRS\n\nLooking ahead, there\u2019s reason to fear that the new tax bill will only make the situation worse. Among its key provisions is a sizable tax break for these sole proprietorships and other so-called \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses (non-corporate businesses whose profits are distributed among owners and recorded as a form of personal income).\n\nThis tax advantage functions as a kind of incentive, encouraging more people to file as sole proprietors in order to claim the new deduction. That in of itself is entirely legal, and in some cases could spur entrepreneurship as people jump at the lower-cost chance to start their own small businesses. But it would also mean more people moving from the well-regulated world of paystubs to the tax-evasion-rich world of self-reporting, providing easier paths to tax cheating for more people. Some workers could even use creative accounting to pretend that they are independent contractors in order to take advantage of such opportunities.\n\nFoe No. 3: Partisanship\n\nNorms matter, too, when it comes to tax evasion. Comparative studies of different tax systems have found that people are more likely to pay when they have faith in their government \u2014 and the overall fairness of its tax system.\n\nThis is a two-part problem for the United States. First, residents don\u2019t have much faith in the U.S. government: Polls show that levels of trust hover around 20 percent, close to historic lows. Second, rising partisanship makes this trust problem harder to solve, because it means that whoever takes office will face opposition from a stalwart and sizable population of distrusting voters loyal to the other party.\n\nThe U.S. tax system hangs in the balance. A recent working paper from a team of university and government economists found that tax evasion is indeed wired \u2014 like a light switch \u2014 to the partisan outcome of presidential elections. The results suggest that when George W. Bush claimed the presidency in 2000, people in heavily Republican counties became more tax-compliant and suddenly started revealing more of their income to the IRS; ditto for heavily Democratic counties after Barack Obama\u2019s election.\n\nAnd what was the source of this extra income, hidden from view until a friendly president assumed the Oval Office? Using proprietary data from the IRS, the researchers were able to show that more income was suddenly reported from those same under-inspected sources, including sole proprietors and other pass-through businesses.\n\nAlso, while you might expect these swings between Democratic and Republican tax evasion to balance out over time, that\u2019s not guaranteed. If polarization continues to increase, it could be that each election produces a new level of evasion as ever more people on each side look to hide income from presidents they distrust.\n\nOne crucial piece of information is still missing in all this: How much are people currently concealing, year in and year out? The IRS makes that calculation as part of its \u201ctax gap\u201d reports, but that means that the most recent data, from 2008-2010, reflects a time when funding cuts were only beginning and the new Republican tax bill was barely a glimmer in the eye of current House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nEven in 2008-2010, the share of taxable income being secreted from view was at its highest level since the mid-1980s, at 18.3 percent, although the IRS attributes part of this increase to technical changes in how it creates its estimates. Only the IRS knows for sure whether people have continued to hide more money from tax collectors since then, but apart from a few preliminary calls from legislators for extra funding to help the IRS oversee the latest tax reform package, there has been no effort to stop it. Quite the contrary, the foes of tax compliance have only gathered strength.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tariffs-and-bank-regulations-are-splitting-both-parties-in-the-lead-up-to-the-midterms/", "published": "2018-03-15T16:30:48", "title": "Tariffs And Bank Regulations Are Splitting Both Parties In The Lead-Up To The Midterms", "text": "We think of today\u2019s Washington as being rigidly divided along party lines on nearly every issue. But a bloc of Democrats in the Senate just joined with Republicans and the Trump administration on a bill that would lighten some restrictions on banks imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, one of President Obama\u2019s signature policy achievements. Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans are considering legislation that would stop President Trump\u2019s new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which several Democrats and labor leaders have publicly supported.\n\nBipartisanship? What is going on here? First, on policy, it\u2019s clear that the economic issue divides within the two parties that were exposed in 2015 and 2016 remain unresolved, as both the Democratic and Republican parties have establishment wings clashing with populist blocs. Second, I suspect that some Democrats running for re-election in more conservative-leaning states are looking for ways to make their public profiles less liberal by aligning with some of Trump\u2019s positions.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the policy. On the biggest issues of 2017 (health care and taxes), Trump basically abandoned the populism of his presidential campaign and signed on to traditionally conservative bills. Democrats, even ones in red states, felt no need to back these bills since they did not reflect their priorities and were unpopular with the public. No Democrat in the House or the Senate voted for either the tax policy overhaul or the GOP\u2019s various measures to repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut the unity within the two parties and the clear divide between them in 2017 should not make us completely forget about 2015-2016. In those years, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was casting the Obama administration as too friendly to Wall Street, and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was making a similar case against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries. On the GOP side, Trump was proposing new tariffs, opposing international trade deals and generally talking up more protectionist, \u201cnationalist\u201d stands; establishment-oriented presidential candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sharply criticized one of Trump\u2019s tariff ideas and embraced trade agreements that Trump opposed.\n\nIt seems like the energy and passion of the Democratic grass roots is now on the left, echoing the more populist visions of Sanders and Warren. So I am a bit surprised both by the size of the bloc of Senate Democrats who voted to roll back some of Dodd-Frank (16 Democratic senators and one Democratic-leaning independent joined Republicans \u2014 more than a third of the Senate Democratic caucus) and by the individual members from more liberal states who joined this effort, like Virginia\u2019s Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. But I was not surprised by the reaction of Warren, who has suggested that her Democratic colleagues who backed this bill are tools of Wall Street and that they will be partly responsible if there is another stock market crash and taxpayers bail out the large banks again.\n\nThe embrace of this bill by those 17 members of the Senate Democratic caucus suggests that the populist wing of the Democratic Party has not completely taken over. The Democrats backing the bill argue that this is simply a readjustment of the measure\u2019s language to get rid of some of its unintended consequences \u2014 they feel that the Dodd-Frank rules were meant to apply to the biggest banks in the country but are currently hitting too many smaller banks. (A key provision that the Senate is considering stipulates that only banks with more than $250 billion in assets would be considered \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d and therefore subject to a number of provisions in Dodd-Frank targeting the largest banks. Under current law, that oversight applies to banks with more than $50 billion in assets.)\n\nBut it\u2019s easy to see this dispute as a manifestation of the tug-of-war going on between more liberal and more centrist Democrats. The 10 Senate Democrats with the lowest Trump Scores (FiveThirtyEight\u2019s measure of how often they vote with the Trump administration) all opposed this legislation. The 10 Senate Democrats who vote most with the Trump administration all backed this bill.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the split on tariffs is even sharper: One man (Trump) stands against the Republican Party establishment. Before Trump formally announced the tariffs, which are expected to go into effect this month and are designed to lift the U.S. steel and aluminum industries, a group of 107 House Republicans signed on to a letter expressing concerns about them. In contrast, there is really no organized effort in the broader Republican Party or on the Hill to defend the tariffs. The president had the power to implement his policy anyway, but he does not appear to have persuaded the rest of the GOP leadership to move in a different direction on trade.\n\nTariffs do have their supporters, though \u2014 among the opposition. Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia were among those who spoke positively about them, along with Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, a coalition of unions across the U.S. Brown in particular has long warned about the dangers of international trade for American workers. On trade policy, Trump is simply more aligned with Democrats in the Rust Belt than Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where we come to politics. What if the reshuffling of the party lines on Dodd-Frank and tariffs is all about the midterms? Seven of the 10 Democrats running for re-election this year in states Trump won in 2016 support the Dodd-Frank rollback. Brown and Casey, who are among that 10, don\u2019t support that legislation \u2014 but aligning with Trump on tariffs could help their prospects, since these members may need some Trump voters who liked his rhetoric on economic issues in 2016 to back them this fall.\n\nSimilarly, opposing tariffs and supporting a rollback of Dodd-Frank, which are the positions of most congressional Republicans, align perfectly with the views of the Koch brothers and other big-money donors who will be critical to Republicans keeping control of Congress. Backing Trump\u2019s protectionist policies could help GOP candidates with the party base, which strongly supports both the president and tariffs, but donations and support from the GOP\u2019s establishment donors may be even more valuable. (We should note that backing a rollback of Dodd-Frank could help Democrats get more money from the financial community, too.)\n\nWhile these political considerations matter, I think there is at root a real ideological split within the two parties on economic issues. If Trump continues to take more protectionist positions, that is going to force the Republican Party to either move toward his views or use congressional authority to stop him. It\u2019s not clear if Sanders or Warren or both will run for the 2020 Democratic nomination, but the broader issue of how opposed to big banks and Wall Street the party should be will surely factor into the next presidential party primary.", "author": ["Perry Bacon Jr."]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-tariffs-could-actually-work-if-he-has-a-plan/", "published": "2018-03-13T10:58:43", "title": "Tariffs Can Work \u2014 When They\u2019re Part Of A Plan", "text": "Republicans are in revolt. Economists on the left and right are deeply skeptical. President Trump\u2019s top economic adviser resigned rather than be party to it. The culprit: tariffs, and specifically the president\u2019s decision to slap duties on imported steel (25 percent) and aluminum (10 percent).\n\nThough they are widely vilified, tariffs actually can work, providing protection for a few vulnerable companies, safeguarding entire industries, maybe even encouraging a wholesale reassessment of what counts as fair trade. Tariffs also come with considerable costs and risks, however, and making the gambit work requires a well-defined goal and a winning strategy. And it\u2019s not clear that Trump has the detailed plan needed to make this gamble pay off.\n\nOne early estimate of Trump\u2019s plans, for example, uses a variant of a well-respected model to project that the tariffs would eliminate five jobs for every one they save, because the help they offer steel producers is more than offset by the elevated prices that users of manufactured steel, like car manufacturers, wind up having to pay. This is often a risk with tariffs: By raising the price of imported goods, tariffs strain the budgets of companies \u2014 and consumers \u2014 who buy those goods. In addition, tariffs can provoke an escalating trade war in which foreign countries who resent the new border tax fight back by implementing protectionist measures of their own.\n\nBut these risks don\u2019t mean tariffs are doomed to fail; they just require a long-term goal that justifies the short-term cost in jobs and dollars \u2014 and a way to reach it.\n\nThis kind of targeted tariff helped save Harley Davidson, for example. In the early 1980s, the company was losing market share to smaller, more affordable imports from Japan. Bankruptcy seemed a real possibility until President Ronald Reagan agreed to introduce a severe protective tariff.\n\nDeliberately designed to be fast-acting and short-lived, the tariff started at a steep 49.4 percent before gradually falling back to the normal 4.4 percent rate over the course five years. In the end, it didn\u2019t take that long for Harley Davidson to reorganize its operations, fix manufacturing problems and return to profitability. By year four, they felt secure enough that they actually asked for the tariffs to be lifted early (presumably because the tax had already fallen dramatically and because a show of strength was good PR).\n\nTo some observers, that turnaround might still count as a failure because the company recovered not on its own but with the help of regulations that, by their very nature, interfere with the free market, limiting consumer choices and putting upward pressure on prices. But clearly the tariffs accomplished their basic goal, blunting competition from Japan in order to give an iconic U.S. company breathing room to catch up.\n\nNow consider a broader example of tariffs in action, namely the heavily protectionist world of European agriculture. The EU operates under an integrated set of policies designed to ensure a decent standard of living for Europe\u2019s farmers while also guaranteeing a reliable supply of food for European citizens. Among those policies are direct payments to farmers, funding for rural development \u2014 and also tariffs, including some tariffs that bite deeply into the pockets of U.S. farmers. When sending goods to Europe, American farmers face an average tariff of 13.7 percent, or nearly three times what E.U. farmers face when exporting their products to the U.S.\n\nAll this special treatment for native agriculture comes at a serious cost, of course: Over a third of the E.U. budget goes to support the roughly 5 percent of citizens involved in farming, which is money that can\u2019t be used for other urban or industrial priorities. But what really matters is whether Europeans think these costs are outweighed by the benefits that come with tariffs and other agricultural supports. And in a recent Eurobarometer poll, 52 percent of respondents said they \u201ctotally agree\u201d or \u201ctend to agree\u201d that the EU should have trade barriers for agricultural products, compared to 34 percent who disagreed.\n\nWhich brings us back to Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports from outside North America and a 10 percent levy on aluminum. Here, too, the defining question shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cWhat will it cost?\u201d but rather, \u201cWhat\u2019s the underlying goal, and can it be achieved at a reasonable cost?\u201d\n\nThe chosen goal might be quite narrow, along the lines Trump himself outlined when he signed the tariff proclamations last Thursday: \u201cA strong steel and aluminum industry are vital to our national security.\u201d Ensuring that the U.S. can produce enough steel to keep building planes and ships in the event of a military emergency seems like a tailored and well-defined objective, not unlike the aim of the tightly targeted Harley Davidson tariff.\n\nBut narrow efforts aren\u2019t always the most successful. The last time the U.S. imposed steel tariffs in an attempt to bolster the industry, under President George W. Bush, the real-world effects proved rather meager. Imports did decline, but seven U.S. steel companies still went bankrupt and the number of workers in the industry seems to have dropped. Partly, this may be because the tariffs didn\u2019t last long enough to allow for the kind of restructuring that U.S. steel mills really needed; they were lifted within two years, after the World Trade Organization ruled them illegal. But it\u2019s also possible the industry needed more help than tariffs alone could provide as a result of high pension costs and a history of inadequate investment.\n\nWith the virtue of hindsight, it seems like the time was ripe during Bush\u2019s presidency to pursue a bigger goal: not just helping America\u2019s struggling steel industry but helping many U.S. industries fight off the full force of what\u2019s sometimes called the \u201cChina shock\u201d \u2014 the sudden rise in Chinese imports of all kinds after the country joined the WTO and gained broader access to U.S. markets. Between 2000 and 2007, America lost about a million manufacturing jobs, affecting industries well beyond steel. A more ambitious plan \u2014 one that included steel tariffs alongside other protections and supports \u2014 might have helped defend U.S. industries across the board.\n\nTrump may indeed have something bolder in mind, in which case steel and aluminum tariffs may merely be the opening move. At times, he seems ready to embrace a widening trade war, saying that if Europe retaliates against the steel imports, the U.S. could impose a new tax on EU cars. And during his campaign, he floated the far more disruptive possibility of a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports.\n\nBut if the goal is indeed grander \u2014 a realignment in global trade that opens space for more U.S. exports and U.S. manufacturing jobs \u2014 then tariffs alone probably won\u2019t suffice. Remember that to build a unified agricultural support system, the EU created a complex package of tariffs, subsidies, regulations and rural development aid that all operate in concert.\n\nTo ignite a renaissance of U.S. manufacturing, a lot of other things would have to change: The dollar would probably need to fall further, which would help spur exports; countries like China and Germany would have to start saving less and spending more, thus creating more demand for foreign goods, including those made in America; and the U.S. would likely have to pare back its own appetite for imports, including getting Americans to save more money.\n\nWhatever the objective, it needs to be paired with the appropriate tactics. For some goals, tariffs make sense, even if they do come with costs. Ultimately, the only way to assess Trump\u2019s tariff plans is not with a ledger comparing the boon for steel producers against the cost for steel users, but by identifying the broader goal \u2014 and seeing whether it gets met.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-position-on-iran-shows-how-much-harder-north-korea-will-be/", "published": "2018-03-12T11:00:24", "title": "Trump Is In A Worse Position With North Korea Than Obama Was At The Start Of The Iran Talks", "text": "President Trump boldly announced last week that he would meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to talk disarmament, working to fulfill his recent State of the Union promise to prevent Pyongyang from obtaining nuclear missiles that could hit the U.S. homeland. In making that pledge, Trump declared, \u201cI will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump has been relentless in criticizing predecessor Barack Obama not only for failing to defuse the North Korea threat, but also for the nuclear disarmament deal he did succeed in striking \u2014 the agreement with Iran. Calling that pact fundamentally flawed and unenforceable, Trump indicated that his standards for non-proliferation agreements are exceptionally high. (He still hasn\u2019t spelled out clearly what \u201cdenuclearizing\u201d Pyongyang \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s stated goal \u2014 would look like).\n\nThe contrast between the Trump administration\u2019s approaches to North Korea and Iran indicates how difficult it will be for the president to fulfill his promise regarding Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 Trump so far has put himself in a worse bargaining position with North Korea than Obama was at the start of the Iran talks, and the challenge in North Korea is even greater.\n\nObama was in a better position with Iran\n\nAfter several months of secret contacts between U.S. and Iranian officials, Obama signed off on the start of a formal negotiation process in November 2013. He entered those talks with several advantages over Trump\u2019s current situation; in particular, Obama had secured an interim agreement in which Tehran promised to freeze its nuclear progress, meaning that it couldn\u2019t use the talks simply to buy more time as it tried to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nTrump has no such commitment. While Kim allegedly offered to halt nuclear and missile tests this week while negotiating with the Americans, he made no pledge to stop the work that precipitated the current crisis: miniaturizing a nuclear warhead and fitting it atop an missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. And North Korea has dragged out negotiation processes in the past.\n\nObama was in a better position with the world\n\nThe main reason that Iran came to the negotiating table in 2013 is that the world had unified behind a far-reaching international sanctions campaign targeting Tehran over its nuclear work. Led by the U.S. but brokered through the United Nations, there was near-universal agreement that it was essential that Iran be kept from getting the bomb, even at the price of hurting domestic economies. The result was sanctions that caused Iran real pain.\n\nIn addition, five world powers (the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.K., France, Russia and China \u2014 and Germany) had come together with the U.S. to conduct the negotiations, meaning that Iran couldn\u2019t play countries off one another and any agreement signed had much greater heft.\n\nThough North Korea is under tight international sanctions and has a decimated economy, the biggest economy in the world \u2014 and the one country that is a lifeline for Pyongyang \u2014 hasn\u2019t ever signed onto the U.S. strategy: China. Trump said during the campaign that his game plan for taking on the North Korean regime would be to enlist Beijing, but while he has made some progress in that direction, there is far from a unified vision between the two powers about how to treat North Korea.\n\nObama was in a better position with his administration\n\nThe U.S. had laid years of groundwork before entering into talks with Iran. Well before Obama took office, the George W. Bush administration started the sanctions regime that ultimately proved critical. Washington had accumulated experience on how best to target sanctions; how to assess Iran\u2019s behavior in talks; and where they were most likely to find common ground.\n\nObama also had the full support of his Cabinet \u2014 necessary for a negotiation that requires the tireless diplomatic efforts of a secretary of state, the scientific expertise of an energy secretary, the sanctions enforcement of a Treasury secretary and the muscle of a defense secretary. Each step of the process was overseen by the entirety of the National Security Council.\n\nTrump, in contrast, reportedly made a snap decision to meet with Kim and didn\u2019t so much as consult with his National Security Council. It was \u201ca decision the president took himself,\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said plainly on Friday, mere hours after telling journalists traveling with him in Africa that direct negotiations were far down the line. Tillerson \u2014 who is nominally leading efforts to engage the North diplomatically \u2014 seems to have found out about the summit around the same time as the rest of us.\n\nThen there are the many ways that the North Korea situation is a tougher nuclear nut to crack than Iran\u2019s missile program. That might be part of the reason that it was the top unfinished crisis item that Obama left on Trump\u2019s desk, warning on his way out that it would be the new president\u2019s greatest challenge.\n\nNorth Korea has a stronger nuclear position than Iran\n\nIran did not already have nuclear weapons during those 2013-2015 negotiations. But North Korea does. Tehran was still in the process of producing highly enriched uranium usable for nuclear weapons and was only on the threshold of a nuclear weapons capacity when the interim deal froze the program.\n\nPyongyang already has up to 60 warheads, according to U.S. intelligence community assessments. At this point, the Koreans are simply perfecting their delivery vehicle, an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching any part of the U.S..\n\nPut simply: The more advanced the program, the more embedded it is in a nation\u2019s military and national security strategy, the more spread out its infrastructure is across the country, the more difficult it\u2019s going to be to detect, monitor and dismantle. And on all of these scores, Pyongyang is far beyond where Tehran ever was.\n\nNorth Korea has a better ability to hide its activities\n\nOne of the central pillars of the Iran deal is the requirement for constant monitoring of Tehran\u2019s declared nuclear-related sites and expedited access for inspectors to other sites upon request. This is meant to cover Iran\u2019s entire nuclear fuel cycle \u2014 or, in the words of skeptical Western diplomats, the \u201cchain of evidence\u201d of their nuclear activity \u2014 from start to finish, including its uranium mines and mills and enrichment and storage facilities. Meanwhile, the North Korean technology in contention \u2014 building ICBMs \u2014 is a matter of quiet and undetectable military research and development. Kim\u2019s government could be working in laboratories the U.S. never knows about.\n\nFurthermore, the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency is allowed to inspect only areas to which it has either been invited or where a nation has agreed to cede oversight control. Bet world powers would not know where to begin negotiating for access in North Korea, because it has no real grasp on where all the nuclear-related facilities are hidden. In other words, U.S. intelligence has extremely low confidence in where those 60-odd warheads are \u2014 if that\u2019s the right number.\n\nIn addition, all of North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities are de facto military facilities \u2014 a significant barrier to inspections, as nations of all stripes argue it\u2019s a violation of their sovereignty to grant U.N. monitors access to military sites. The IAEA would be dependent on Pyongyang providing an exhaustive list of nuclear facilities, even though it has consistently lied throughout the lives of past agreements.\n\nTrump started out in a weak position on North Korea and now is poised to enter talks from an even poorer posture. His lack of specificity about the terms of denuclearization means that his negotiators must enter high-stakes talks without knowing his own parameters for success. And then there\u2019s Pyongyang\u2019s wager that U.S. military options would be frozen so long as both parties remain at the negotiating table \u2014 raising the risk that North Korea is, once again, buying itself valuable time through talks to advance its nuclear arsenal.\n\nMeanwhile, the president\u2019s hardline position on the Iran deal could affect his negotiating posture with North Korea. At roughly the same time he plans on meeting with Kim, he is threatening to pull out of the Iran accord if the Europeans don\u2019t provide assurances that they are willing to strengthen it \u2014 suggesting that the U.S. cannot be trusted to follow through on its promises across governments, among other messages.\n\nOf course, whether Trump decides to go ahead with the summit under these conditions is far from certain. White House officials are already backpedaling on the president\u2019s firm commitment to the South Koreans that he would sit down with Kim by May.", "author": ["Michael Wilner"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/making-sense-of-trumps-two-big-moves-on-north-korea-and-tariffs/", "published": "2018-03-09T18:12:26", "title": "Making Sense Of Trump\u2019s Two Big Moves On North Korea And Tariffs", "text": "The announcement on Thursday night that President Trump planned to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, likely in May, was weird. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed blindsided by the move, it breaks with U.S. precedent (no sitting commander in chief has ever met with a North Korean leader), and it was announced at the White House in part by South Korean officials, rather than senior U.S. figures, like Tillerson or national security adviser H.R. McMaster or Trump.\n\nPair this announcement with what else happened on Thursday \u2014 Trump enacting new aluminum and steel tariffs over the objections of Republicans in Congress \u2014 and you have the president not only doing things that are surprising, but doing them on big, consequential issues. Until now, he has largely reserved his boldness for tweets and other rhetoric rather than actions.\n\nIs Trump growing more willing to break political norms and traditions in deed as well as word? It\u2019s too soon to say. But here are five things Trump\u2019s North Korea and tariffs moves tell us about the president\u2019s impulses.\n\n1. Trump is leading \u2014 Trump often seems like a weak and disengaged president, with his ideas downplayed and/or ignored by Republicans on Capitol Hill (his infrastructure proposal) and even his own staffers (his Democrat-friendly positions on immigration and guns at recent bipartisan meetings). But on tariffs and North Korea, Trump appears to have taken control. He took advantage of the fact that Congress doesn\u2019t have to sign off on either of these decisions and that even if his staffers want to rein him in (as they sometimes do), that becomes a lot tougher when he publicly announces a policy.\n\n2. But his ideas can still be slowed or sanded down \u2014 Last year, Trump, without really consulting the Pentagon, announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military. Though Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would probably dispute this characterization, it appears that he doesn\u2019t agree with the ban and is basically doing everything he can not to implement it. Or, to take another example: The president wants an expensive military parade, \u00e0 la France\u2019s Bastille Day celebration. I\u2019m not sure that will happen either.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s bold moves this week demonstrate the extent to which he is still operating within constraints. While Trump aides initially said his tariffs would have no exceptions, the final policy exempted Canada and Mexico as the president seemed to bow to complaints from congressional Republicans.\n\nDo I think that Trump and Kim will appear in a room together this year? Most likely. It will be hard for his aides to stop this meeting from happening now. But what that meeting will look like is another story. I suspect his aides will try to shift the session away from what Trump probably has in mind (him bonding with Kim and making a deal) and toward a more formal diplomatic session (lots of senior officials from the U.S. in the room trying to keep Trump on the script they have written for him).\n\n3. The establishment hates tariffs more than meeting with North Korea, so the stakes are different for Trump \u2014 The tariffs created a rift between Trump and fellow Republicans, and also between the president and top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, who seems to be quitting in protest. In other words, the GOP opposes the tariffs in ways that create political problems for Trump.\n\nIn contrast, while Tillerson may have wished for greater consultation between Trump and himself ahead of the announcement of the Kim meeting, the secretary of state has been calling for months for more diplomacy in dealing with North Korea \u2014 including direct talks between Pyongyang and Washington \u2014 so it\u2019s unlikely he would follow Cohn in resigning.\n\nAnd while congressional hawks might object to this meeting, I don\u2019t think Republicans in Congress will mount serious opposition to it because \u2014 even if they see it as ill-advised \u2014 it does not violate core GOP orthodoxy the way tariffs do. In fact, Vice President Mike Pence, hardly considered a dove before joining the Trump administration, was reportedly going to meet with North Korean officials himself.\n\n4. Trump\u2019s moves are only opening bids, so a lot depends on how he follows up \u2014 Outside of a few Democrats running in red states, it\u2019s hard to find many people in Washington who agree with Trump\u2019s tariffs. Economic experts on the right and left strongly oppose them, arguing that they will start a trade war that hurts the U.S. economy. Trump now owns the course that tariffs take, whether that lurches the country toward economic warfare or not.\n\nOn North Korea, some experts are already saying the meeting is dumb: Trump is giving Kim something the Asian leader really wants (a sit-down with a U.S. president that puts the two nations on somewhat equal footing) for nothing in return (North Korea hasn\u2019t agreed to give up its nuclear capabilities).\n\nConsider these words from Georgetown professor and North Korea expert Victor Cha in a New York Times op-ed after the news of the proposed meeting emerged:\n\nEveryone should be aware that this dramatic act of diplomacy by these two unusual leaders, who love flair and drama, may also take us closer to war. Failed negotiations at the summit level leave all parties with no other recourse for diplomacy. In which case, as Mr. Trump has said, we really will have \u2018run out of road\u2019 on North Korea.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear this meeting will make things much worse, since North Korea seems hell-bent on a nuclear weapons program anyway. And Trump\u2019s move is also receiving some positive feedback, especially from Democrats who have advocated for a less confrontational approach toward Kim. Leon Panetta, who was defense secretary under President Obama, called it a \u201cpositive step.\u201d\n\n5. Trump will argue his aggressive rhetoric is working, but there\u2019s no reason to think it is \u2014 I expect Trump and his aides to cast this meeting as a sign that the president\u2019s threats to attack North Korea \u2014 remember \u201cfire and fury\u201d and a \u201cmuch bigger and more powerful\u201d nuclear button \u2014 brought Kim to the negotiating table. I would be skeptical of that claim. President Obama probably could have met with Kim Jong Un (or Presidents Clinton and Bush with his father Kim Jong Il, the previous North Korean leader) if they had wanted. They didn\u2019t deem such an encounter the best way to stop North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions, and they may have been correct.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether this meeting, even if it\u2019s historic, will lead to the North Koreans\u2019 pulling back from their nuclear program. We don\u2019t know whether the imposition of tariffs, and the threats from Trump that made them sound extra menacing, will have the effect of cowing other countries\u2019 trade posture into something more to the U.S.\u2019s liking. Moreover, we don\u2019t know if bad results will cow Trump himself or whether he\u2019ll continue to feel free to act on his personal positions regardless of what his policy advisers and Washington Republicans think.", "author": ["Perry Bacon Jr."]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-is-keeping-reluctant-trump-voters-with-him/", "published": "2018-03-08T15:45:23", "title": "The Economy Is Keeping \u2018Reluctant\u2019 Trump Voters With Him", "text": "Last spring, FiveThirtyEight commissioned a SurveyMonkey poll that aimed to glean the views of voters who cast their ballots for President Trump but did so unenthusiastically. We called them \u201creluctant\u201d Trump voters; they were crucial in Trump\u2019s victory, and we\u2019ve been keeping tabs on this voter demographic over the year, including a new survey conducted Feb. 12-19.\n\nWho are reluctant Trump voters? They make up about a fifth of the president\u2019s 2016 coalition, and they are predominantly white \u2014 as are most of his supporters. But compared with other Trump voters, this reluctant group is slightly more likely to have a college education, call themselves politically moderate and identify as independent.\n\nMore than one year in, reluctant Trump voters are generally still happy that they voted for Trump. In the most recent survey, 57 percent of reluctant Trump voters said they had no regrets about their vote, though 28 percent said the jury was still out. For a comparison, 83 percent of all Trump voters said they had no regrets, while 11 percent said the jury was still out.\n\nMost importantly, our latest survey shows that the president is making some inroads with these reluctant Trump voters, however gradual, and that the economy is a big reason why.\n\nIn April of last year, our survey found that only 14 percent of reluctant Trump voters strongly approved of the job the president was doing. In the latest iteration of the survey, that number had ticked up to 22 percent. This could be due in part to reluctant Trump voters\u2019 views of the economy and their perceptions of Trump\u2019s handling of it.\n\nLast April, 87 percent of reluctant Trump voters approved of the way the president was handling the economy, with 29 percent \u201cstrongly\u201d approving and 58 percent \u201csomewhat\u201d approving. Last month, two months after the passage of the Republican tax bill, 84 percent of reluctant Trump voters said they approved of the way the president was handling the economy, but there was a notable jump in the percentage who \u201cstrongly\u201d approved \u2014 it was up to 40 percent from 29.\n\nThis is all obviously good news for Trump, but it also entails some risk. Our survey was conducted before Trump\u2019s surprise announcement last week that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, potentially setting off an international trade war. The move would fly in the face of Republican orthodoxy on free trade. It led Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, to announce his resignation, and it drew a rare public rebuke from House Speaker Paul Ryan. It\u2019s unclear how imposing tariffs might affect reluctant Trump voters\u2019 views on his handling of the economy, but if a trade war dampens economic growth, this is the part of the president\u2019s coalition that could be most at risk of abandoning him.\n\nFor now, though, reluctant Trump voters are mostly with the president. You can see that in their view of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 reluctant Trump voters, like all other Trump voters, see coverage of the Mueller investigation as overblown. Seventy-eight percent of reluctant Trump voters said the media was paying too much attention to Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. More enthusiastic Trump supporters were more likely to feel that way (89 percent), but not that much more likely. (Only 18 percent of respondents who voted for Hillary Clinton felt the same.) Partisanship, it would seem, continues to rule the day on the country\u2019s most contentious political matter.\n\nAnd, looking forward a bit, reluctant Trump voters could be a pivotal group in determining the political fallout of whatever Mueller finds. We asked people how serious they would consider it if Mueller \u201cdetermines President Trump obstructed justice by interfering with the investigation into his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russian government officials.\u201d While 73 percent of Americans think it would be a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d serious matter if the investigation finds that Trump obstructed justice, only 44 percent of Trump\u2019s enthusiastic backers fell into those categories. Reluctant Trump voters were in the middle: 64 percent said an obstruction finding would be at least somewhat serious.", "author": ["Clare Malone"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/blockchain-is-just-another-way-make-art-all-about-money/", "published": "2018-03-07T18:13:42", "title": "The Blockchain Is Just Another Way To Make Art All About Money", "text": "The Blockchain Is Just Another Way To Make Art All About Money Commercialism has suffocated traditional art. Is digital art next?\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, a small group of art collectors pooled $1 million worth of cryptocurrency to buy a photograph of a rose. But the picture won\u2019t be unwrapped over a candlelit dinner or hung on a bedroom wall. The photograph doesn\u2019t exist physically; it\u2019s a simple digital image. Its apparent value lies in its associated \u201ctoken\u201d: a one-of-a-kind digital asset that exists on an enduring, cryptographic digital ledger called the blockchain. The token, unlike the image, can\u2019t be duplicated. But its success could be.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote about people trying to turn a cartoon frog called Pepe into the vanguard of art\u2019s future on the blockchain. Reporting on that story immersed me in memes, but also in the ways that new technology might change the art world. A small triumvirate of artists, technologists and financiers are using the blockchain to render art rare and then selling it. In the process, they\u2019ve figured out a way to make digital art valuable.\n\nA lot of what makes physical art valuable is its scarcity \u2014 there are only so many paintings by Mark Rothko, after all. But digital art has always been different because it can be perfectly copied, ad infinitum. Crypto technology and the blockchain may be able to change all that. Just like Bitcoins are scarce, so too can original digital artwork now be scarce, even if duplicates remain common in the same way that prints or photographs of physical artwork are common. Proponents argue that this would democratize and decentralize art, helping artists get paid, helping resolve issues of authorship and ownership that the internet had rendered murky, and taking power out of the hands of auction houses and gallerists. But as I dove deeper into the promise of crypto-art, it seems to me more likely to democratize and decentralize not art itself, but art commerce. The appreciation of art and the fetishization of its prices have already become hopelessly intertwined. Crypto-art pulls this knot even tighter.\n\nManufacturing scarcity\n\nSpecific works of art used to be scarce simply because there was no technology available that could precisely copy them. Painters could, and did, attempt to recreate others\u2019 works, but for centuries the only really reliable image of, say, Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d itself. If only da Vinci\u2019s rivals had had a camera.\n\nThis eventually changed, of course. John Berger, an English critic, was fascinated by what happened when humans developed the technology to reproduce art, especially oil paintings. \u201cFor the first time ever,\u201d he wrote in 1972, \u201cimages of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free.\u201d Even as I write this, I\u2019m drinking tea from a mug decorated with a collage of images pulled from the works of artists from da Vinci to Edvard Munch to Jeff Koons. For Berger, this was the democratizing process, and one that undermined an art establishment that \u201cmakes inequality seem noble and hierarchies seem thrilling.\u201d As far as Berger was concerned, the cultural role that museums play should instead be filled by the images children choose to pin to their bulletin boards.\n\nComputers and the internet accelerated art\u2019s movement toward ubiquity and freeness \u2014 images, songs and films could be shared infinitely and quickly (often to the chagrin of their creators, who sometimes fought back). Those trying to bring the blockchain to art are, in a way, trying to reverse this process \u2014 to reintroduce scarcity, authenticity and an aura of exclusivity to a work of art. A piece of art on the blockchain can be one-of-a-kind in the way the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d once was.\n\nThere are several outfits in search of a crypto da Vinci. The Rare Pepe project and its cartoon frogs may be the first blockchain art market where anyone can submit their original work. CryptoKitties, the Beanie Babies of the blockchain, offers blockchain-bound cats for users to collect and breed. CryptoPunks deals in algorithmically generated digital characters. DADA.nyc is an artistic social network, featuring visual conversations between artists, that\u2019s now powered by the blockchain.\n\nBeatriz Helena Ramos founded DADA.nyc and knows that money is part of crypto-art\u2019s allure. \u201cWhen I saw the Rare Pepes example, I knew there was something there. Now it feels like a movement. It feels like the beginning of something big.\u201d\n\nJason Bailey, who creates, collects and blogs about crypto-art, agreed with Ramos and added that crypto-art also redistributes power in the art market. \u201cWe have seen what happens to organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts when left in the hands of a centralized power,\u201d Bailey said \u2014 if much of the money supporting the arts comes from a few big groups, then thousands of artists are at risk any time those groups face funding cuts. \u201cBuilding a robust, decentralized network of patrons is an important step toward ensuring the arts flourish in the future.\u201d (Power and money are never far from each other in art.)\n\nBut these claims of democratizing art are coming from the opposite direction of Berger\u2019s. Berger argues that technology like the camera leads to free and widespread replication, which levels the playing field, which allows consumers from all walks of life to access art. But crypto-art\u2019s boosters invert that dynamic. Technology like the blockchain, they say, democratizes art by creating scarcity, allowing more artists to profit from their work, thus leveling the playing field for creators rather than consumers. In their minds, that\u2019s the gunshot that will spark the revolution.\n\nArt as commodity\n\nArt has existed since Neanderthals began making cave paintings, but its hypercommercialization is a much more recent phenomenon, reaching a crescendo in the last few decades. No one artist\u2019s work was more responsible for melding art with cash than Andy Warhol\u2019s, which generates great mass media appeal and exists in great quantities \u2014 Warhol mass-produced replicas of Brillo boxes that now sell for millions. The 2018 version of Warhol\u2019s iconic Marilyn Monroe is a cartoon frog named Pepe.\n\nSome prominent critics saw an existential danger in art\u2019s gold rush. \u201cThe entanglement of big money with art has become a curse on how art is made, controlled and, above all, the way it is experienced,\u201d the late critic Robert Hughes says in his 2008 documentary, \u201cThe Mona Lisa Curse.\u201d He continues: \u201cAt the age of 70, I belong to the last generation that could spend time in a museum without ever once thinking about what the art might cost.\u201d\n\nAs art reached new heights of commercialism, artists split into two schools. On one hand were the commercialists: savvy marketeers such as Koons and Damien Hirst making market- and hype-ready pieces and getting very rich. On the other hand were the non-commercialists, including the earthworks artists, such as Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson, who ventured to the middle of a desert or a lake and turned rocks and dirt into unsellable work the size of towns that could, literally, crush an art gallery.\n\nBut in the popular consciousness, the commercialists won. \u201cMaking money is art and working is art and good business is the best art,\u201d Warhol once said.\n\nCrypto-art seems to embrace Warhol\u2019s philosophy. Sure, Rare Pepes and CrytoKitties can\u2019t fetch anywhere near the astronomical prices that traditional art can sometimes command. But in crypto-art, commerce is wrapped like a kudzu vine around the industry\u2019s newly formed artistic infrastructure. In the case of Rare Pepes, the art, literally and technically, is the currency \u2014 Rare Pepes are bought with Pepe Cash, a cryptocurrency that\u2019s just an incredibly plentiful piece of Pepe art. The value of an artwork fluctuates directly and wildly with swings in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Pepe Cash.\n\nJess Houlgrave, a cofounder of a company that tracks art ownership using the blockchain, regularly ponders these issues. She comes from a finance background, has worked at both Credit Suisse and the bids department at Sotheby\u2019s auction house, and wrote a master\u2019s thesis titled \u201cBlockchain: A critical assessment of use within the art ecosystem.\u201d I asked her what it meant that art was moving to the blockchain, and whether we should worry about the further intertwining of art and commerce.\n\n\u201cArtists have \u2014 for hundreds if not thousands of years \u2014 explored, explained and challenged current social and technological phenomena,\u201d Houlgrave said. \u201cThe artists who are making work focused on the blockchain \u2014 it\u2019s like any other movement [of people] who are looking at what\u2019s happening on the cutting edge.\u201d The cutting edge is now commerce.\n\nHoulgrave said that disputing or fighting the innate connection between art and commerce, as Hughes did or as I am inclined to, is naive. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency for people to say that art is just art and we shouldn\u2019t commodify it and should treat it as something that isn\u2019t an asset. The truth is that, for thousands of years, art has been an asset. It\u2019s been very tied up with our financial systems.\u201d Crypto-art just takes those ties a step further: It lives on a financial system.\n\nThe new art factory\n\nEvery revolution has its unintended consequences. What will be crypto-art\u2019s?\n\nJohn Zettler runs Rare Art Labs, a company that has sprouted up to help speed along the adoption of crypto-art. The company plans to tokenize digital artworks, thereby giving them a home on the blockchain, and to advise artists on how \u2014 and for how much \u2014 to sell their work.\n\nAt Rare Art Labs\u2019 Rare Digital Art Festival in January, a single digital Pepe the Frog image called \u201cHomer Pepe\u201d sold for over $30,000. The festival merited wide-eyed coverage in The New York Times, The Paris Review and Vice (though the Times didn\u2019t mention Pepe). If you\u2019ve heard of crypto-art before this week, odds are it was thanks to this event.\n\nRare Art Labs\u2019 motto is #ArtistsDeserveMore, and by my count, Zettler said the phrase \u201cvalue accretion\u201d four times during our interview. (His pinned tweet is a quote from Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and billionaire venture capitalist.) \u201cOur founding mission is to increase the aggregate artistic output of humankind,\u201d Zettler told me as we sat in a gilded monument to late capitalism: an exclusive coworking space in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron District that\u2019s sponsored by a huge multinational bank and designed for financial technology professionals. During the day he ponders artistic techno-abracadabra like: \u201cHow would you build an incentive structure for all network participants whereby you could actually create a self-fueling virtuous loop with an economics-based fuel, if you will, for bootstrapping the network and creating monetary incentives for early adoption?\u201d\n\nOne of Zettler\u2019s goals for the company is to establish, \u201cin places like Brooklyn,\u201d coworking spaces where artists can ply their trade at \u201cvery reduced prices.\u201d The company would supply creation tools such as cameras and software; Zettler\u2019s on-site tech experts would help the artists tokenize their work, placing it on the blockchain; and auction consultants would advise artists on when, where and in what quantities to sell their work.\n\nWarhol had his Factory; now Zettler wants his.\n\nOthers in his company sounded well aware of the risks of this marriage between art and commerce. \u201cIf this turns out to be part of the crypto-bastardization of art, I will be ashamed for the rest of my life for being a part of it, but I think, as of now, it seems it is having and will have a very positive impact on creators,\u201d Tommy Nicholas, Rare Art Labs\u2019 founding adviser, told me.\n\nA new order is emerging in the art world. But will it be any different than the old one? People like Zettler make me think not. He and Rare Art Labs may be handling a new type of art, but what they\u2019re doing with it is nothing new; in fact, it\u2019s exactly what the critic Hughes warned us against: the fetishization of art\u2019s prices and the emptying of its higher virtues. As a result, the relationship between art and the blockchain, which seems symbiotic for the moment, could soon become parasitic. Artists can only avoid the art establishment\u2019s capitalistic maw for so long.\n\nRead more: People Are Paying Thousands Of Dollars To Own Pictures Of Pepe The Frog\n\nDevelopment by Justin McCraw.", "author": ["Oliver Roeder"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-gary-cohns-white-house-resignation-is-different/", "published": "2018-03-07T12:55:22", "title": "Four Reasons That Gary Cohn\u2019s White House Resignation Is Different", "text": "Lots of people have left President Trump\u2019s White House. Those departures never seemed likely to have a real impact on policy. Most of them didn\u2019t appear to tell us something larger about what was going on within the administration, beyond it being chaotic. But the resignation on Tuesday of National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, the top White House economic policy adviser, appears to have direct policy implications \u2014 and it could portend other changes in the administration.\n\nWhy is Cohn different? Four reasons.\n\nTrump seems to be serious about tariffs \u2014 This resignation, unlike the departure of Communications Director Hope Hicks last week, appears to be directly related to a policy decision: Trump is on the verge of implementing tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. This move comes over the strong objections of Cohn, who has been trying to block Trump from making it since the start of the administration. Trump sounded like an economic populist during much of the 2016 campaign, but until now he had largely abandoned that approach while in office. Instead, he had been pursuing a Wall Street-friendly agenda of tax cuts and deregulation shaped in part by Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive.\n\nThat Cohn resigned suggests that Trump is serious about implementing these tariffs, despite resistance from fellow Republicans and the business community. This is not like Trump talking about supporting gun control, only to backtrack soon after. Trump has long favored new tariffs, appears to be acting on that policy preference and didn\u2019t stop pushing in that direction when his top economic adviser objected so strongly that he quit. Of course, this is Trump, so he could always reverse course, but so far he appears more serious about following through on tariffs than on his other more unconventional views.\n\nTrump is breaking with GOP orthodoxy in a big way \u2014 Cohn isn\u2019t the only person who objects to these tariffs. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who usually avoids direct criticism of the president, went public with his opposition to the tariffs. So has Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has largely aligned himself on policy with the president since Trump entered office.\n\nIf Trump is following through with these tariffs, as Cohn\u2019s resignation suggests, this is one of the most significant instances of the president separating himself from the broader party. Despite all the hubbub, Trump has pursued a pretty typically Republican policy agenda; tariffs would be the first real break.\n\nTrump has dumped one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d \u2014 We don\u2019t know exactly how decisions are made in the Trump administration. But people on the outside of the administration have likened Cohn\u2019s role on economic policy to that of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\u2019s on national security \u2014 an administration official with more traditional, establishment views looking to push the president away from his more unorthodox instincts. That role helps explain why the presence of Cohn in the White House has been a key source of reassurance to Wall Street and other market-minded constituencies. If Trump is willing to part with Cohn, is the president more likely to take other controversial steps on economic policy that he has hinted at in the past, such as pulling the U.S. out of NAFTA? Also, what if Trump no longer wants advisers who are in conflict with his views? Would he let Mattis resign if the two strongly disagreed on something?\n\nPeople with good jobs are leaving the White House, suggesting deep staff dissatisfaction \u2014 I assume that working with Trump is difficult. That said, there are some major perks. You might, as Hicks did, get to meet the pope. Cohn played a key role in writing a major tax bill. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s economic policy directors all remained for at least 23 months. Cohn is leaving this prestigious job after only about a year. That two fairly senior advisers are departing the Trump administration in a week\u2019s time \u2014 whatever the circumstances \u2014 is telling. Both Cohn and Hicks appear to have decided that the upside of remaining in the White House is outweighed by the downside.\n\nDoes that tell us anything? Maybe not. Every departure has its own peculiarities. Maybe Trump really wanted one or both of them gone, even if these moves were cast as resignations, not dismissals. But at the very least, Cohn and Hicks\u2019 decisions suggest that Trump hasn\u2019t become easier to manage or less erratic. Maybe Hicks and Cohn believe that the best days of working in the Trump White House have passed.\n\nAs I said before, this is Donald Trump, so he could decide next week to drop the tariffs idea and hire another person from Goldman Sachs to replace Cohn \u2014 or even ask Cohn himself to come back. But I doubt it. Instead, I will be curious \u2014 with Cohn ostensibly leaving over tariffs \u2014 whether Trump will take additional steps to implement his vision in his second year as president, even if he has to dump some well-respected aides along the way.", "author": ["Perry Bacon Jr."]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pepe-the-frog-symbolism-cryptoart-blockchain/", "published": "2018-03-06T11:00:54", "title": "People Are Paying Thousands Of Dollars To Own Pictures Of Pepe The Frog", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: This article includes depictions of a cartoon character that many deem offensive due to its association with white supremacist groups. Some links in this story lead to offensive material.\n\nPepe the Frog started as just a chilled-out amphibian with a chilled-out catchphrase: \u201cFeels good man.\u201d That was back in 2005, when he first appeared in a comic series called \u201cBoy\u2019s Club.\u201d When the comic debuted, Pepe and his cartoon roommates dabbled in \u201claconic psychedelia, childlike enchantment, drug-fueled hedonism, and impish mischief,\u201d according the publisher of a book compiling the strip.\n\nBut even cartoon amphibians can go through a metamorphosis. Pepe soon took on a life of his own, and his mischief became much less impish. The image board 4chan.org \u2014 a sort of twisted, anarchic incubator for memes ranging from wholesome to hateful \u2014 adopted Pepe and relentlessly remixed and repurposed him for far different purposes than the character\u2019s creator, Matt Furie, had intended. Users depicted Pepe as a crudely drawn, bright-green frog with enormous eyes and a wide mouth, often shown looking vaguely sad or slightly sly. He became so broadly popular that he even started showing up in celebrities\u2019 Twitter feeds.\n\nBut soon those remixes included hateful messages. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the frog was co-opted by the so-called alt-right, a loose collection of conservative, populist, white supremacist, neo-fascist and neo-Nazi groups. Pepe became an unofficial mascot of a racist and anti-Semitic campaign in support of the candidacy of Donald Trump. The frog had long since lost its aura of childlike enchantment and had donned MAGA hats and SS insignia. Pepe is now listed as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. Furie lawyered up, trying to wrench his creation back to its original status, but the alt-right fought back. When Richard Spencer, the white supremacist and alt-right figurehead, was famously punched in the face on a D.C. street on President Trump\u2019s Inauguration Day, Spencer was explaining his frog lapel pin, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Pepe. He\u2019s become kind of a symbol \u2014\u201d before being cut off as the punch landed.\n\nNow one group of people wants to make Pepe symbolize something else: the future. Artists and speculators are building a new way to make and sell art, trying to repurpose a cartoon popularized by a message board so lawless that it scared away advertisers and turn it into a viable commercial enterprise.\n\nGathering in a digital bazaar for Pepe-related images, they\u2019re trying to use the blockchain to create a new kind of art market, one that uses crypto technology and allows anyone to submit their work to be bought, sold and traded. The people involved hope to prove that crypto can be used to shift the art world\u2019s balance of power, putting control into the hands of artists, rather than galleries or commercial third parties. The art that they\u2019re selling, though, depicts that same frog that was featured in so many racist and anti-Semitic memes. But that hasn\u2019t deterred the artists, many of whom believe they\u2019re returning Pepe to his original, chilled-out roots. And they\u2019ve sold over $1.2 million worth of his image in the process. That\u2019s about 100 million in Pepe Cash. Yes, Pepe Cash.\n\nDANK PEPENo. issued: 420\n\nMost of this Pepe buying and selling happens through a website called Rare Pepe Wallet. The site features about 1,600 \u201cRare Pepes,\u201d with more added regularly. They depict Pepe in all manner of memetic mashups and aesthetic forms. Many, but not all, look like trading cards. There\u2019s smiling blonde Trump Pepe. There\u2019s Pepe as Super Mario. Pepe as the Pope on the cover of Time. Warhol Pepe. Dal\u00ed Pepe. Kardashian Pepe. \u201cFuturama\u201d Pepe. Run-DMC Pepe. The Pepe Sistine Chapel. And on and on and on.\n\nThe absurdity of this project is not lost on its participants. \u201cWe\u2019re using the most secure financial computer application ever known to man to swap cartoon frog pics,\u201d Steffen Cope, a Web developer who creates and trades Rare Pepes, told me.\n\nThere\u2019s such a thing as a Rare Pepe market only because of what the blockchain can do: It makes digital assets that are provably scarce. The blockchain\u2019s decentralized record of transactions \u2014 a digital ledger \u2014 can\u2019t be altered without leaving a public record. That allows for a more reliable accounting of who really owns digital art. Each Rare Pepe carries a finite number of digital tokens, and these tokens are what you really buy or sell when you buy a Rare Pepe. The blockchain guarantees, for example, that there are precisely 420 tokens associated with the image \u201cDank Pepe\u201d \u2014 never more, never less.\n\nThis is the same technology that drives cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and, in fact, the Rare Pepe tokens live on the Bitcoin blockchain, making the frog meme tokens as provably rare and as secure as Bitcoin itself.\n\nRare Pepes are even purchased with a cryptocurrency named after the frog \u2014 Pepe Cash \u2014 a unit of which is, as of Monday afternoon, trading for about 5 cents. Pepe Cash, which has been around since 2016, is, itself, a Rare Pepe \u2014 though there are 701,884,009 units of Pepe Cash in circulation. The currency has a market cap of roughly $37 million.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money that could potentially be spent on something that doesn\u2019t tangibly exist. So why in the world would anyone buy a Rare Pepe? After all, the only thing you really own when you buy a Rare Pepe is a digital token; the images themselves are freely available and infinitely reproducible. You can copy them, paste them, email them or tweet them for nothing. So why part with your hard-earned Pepe Cash?\n\n\u201cI think the image isn\u2019t the most important thing,\u201d Joe Looney, the co-founder of the Rare Pepe Foundation and a developer of Rare Pepe Wallet, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not the image so much as it\u2019s the whole legend of it.\u201d\n\nBy \u201clegend,\u201d Looney meant not the frog\u2019s fraught past but the origin story of the each card\u2019s creation \u2014 its artist, its creation date, its ineffable memetic appeal. Sure, the image associated with the token you buy may float around the Web or find its way onto FiveThirtyEight, but you and provably few others are its owners, for whatever that\u2019s worth. (Right now, it appears to be worth a lot \u2014 more than 75 individual Pepes have sold for over $1,000, and over 25,000 in all have changed hands.)\n\nRARE PEPENo. issued: 300\n\nBut, of course, that legend doesn\u2019t necessarily undo Pepe\u2019s legacy. While the Rare Pepe project is exploiting the blockchain for its digital immutability, it\u2019s also attempting to overcome the nature of the internet itself, which can preserve posts for decades, serving as a kind of fossil record for what would once have been cultural ephemera. Regardless of what the cartoon comes to mean in the coming years, the internet is and likely always will be rife with references to the racist Pepe, the Nazi Pepe, and the Pepe lapel decorations of cold-cocked white supremacists.\n\nThe people who trade Rare Pepes are familiar with that tension, though they don\u2019t see it as a reason they should stay away from the frog. I recently found them on Telegram, a messaging app and favorite hangout of the crypto set. I was lurking in a channel called Rare Pepe Blockchain Trading, which at the time had more than 1,500 participants, and I had private chats with about 20 members of the Rare Pepe community. I asked them about what they thought they were creating \u2014 and its politics.\n\nOne user I spoke with, Steve from Los Angeles, who goes by CryptoChainer, refused to share his full real name. He explained, \u201cHaving the first search result of my name come up with Rare Pepe isn\u2019t entirely exciting, but I wish it was.\u201d He added: \u201cMost Americans still probably associate it with alt-right or some crap \u2014 4chan, Nazis, what have you.\u201d But for Steve and other Rare Pepe enthusiasts, Pepe\u2019s appeal lies in part in his versatility \u2014 it\u2019s a recognizable meme that allows endless artistic expression while also serving as a rallying point for their crypto community.\n\nLike Steve, many in the Rare Pepe world \u2014 including a sizable percentage of the community who don\u2019t live in the U.S. \u2014 aren\u2019t very concerned about the frog\u2019s popular connotations. They rejected its racist associations, or were barely aware of them, or were sick of being asked about them, viewing the troubling link as either pass\u00e9 or irrelevant \u2014 the artifact of a specific and fleeting moment in U.S. political history. But even when Pepe isn\u2019t partisan, it can still have politics of a certain kind. \u201cI think Pepe best represents the world\u2019s pivot from P.C. and identity politics back to a more inclusive politics and open exchange of ideas,\u201d someone with the username BuddhaNeedPepecash72 said.\n\nJESUSPEPENo. issued: 10\n\nIndeed, most in the Rare Pepe community see the frog as the future of art and art commerce. One Pepe enthusiast said he hoped to create \u201cthe first eternal digital open museum.\u201d Jason Rosenstein told me that he\u2019s able to pay his New York City rent with the money he\u2019s made from Rare Pepes. Christine Lewis, who, at almost 60, jokingly called herself \u201ccrypto grandma,\u201d came to the community because her friend told her that Pepe Cash was a good investment and that \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be a big deal \u2026 in five years, lol.\u201d Another user, PimpingKek, claimed to be the world\u2019s only Rare Pepe agent, identifying hot talent around the globe, getting them set up on the blockchain, and advising them on how to price their work and roll it out to the market. (Kek, of course, is the Egyptian god of darkness of whom Pepe is said to be a present-day avatar.)\n\nSometimes Pepe\u2019s darkness creeps into the submissions to Rare Pepe Wallet. Anyone can create a Rare Pepe, which means that anything can be submitted as a Rare Pepe. Which is why the Rare Pepe Foundation \u2014 whose website tagline is \u201cBlockchain Revolution\u201d \u2014 says it takes pains to filter out offensive Rare Pepe submissions before they make it to the Rare Pepe Wallet gallery. (\u201cTrying to be keep it light for now,\u201d the site says in its submission guidelines. \u201cPepe has alot of bad press.\u201d) Looney said that organizers have blocked the submission of offensive Pepes before, but that they hadn\u2019t needed to recently. \u201cThat probably coincided with when it was more in the media as a Nazi frog,\u201d he said.\n\nEven among the Rare Pepes approved for display in the online gallery, it\u2019s difficult to judge how many people might find them offensive, or even whether they\u2019re intended to offend. One work, titled \u201cTrump Wall,\u201d depicts a crude Mexican frog caricature, but Looney said it was created by a Mexican artist, and it has a description that reads, \u201cPepe not impressed by Trump Wall.\u201d Many others explicitly address politics. There is one titled \u201cKillary Pepe\u201d that features the caption \u201ccircumvent any law\u201d under an image of a Hillary Clinton frog sending an email. There is an entire series of Putin-themed Pepes. There are a handful of Trump-themed ones. There is a Pepe take on Clinton\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d campaign slogan. But many Rare Pepes are so tongue-in-cheek, so caked with alternating layers of irony and truth and absurdity that it\u2019s hard to hear any definite political signal through the noise. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a \u2018no political Pepes\u2019 rule, so you\u2019ll certainly find them if you\u2019re looking through the directory,\u201d Looney said. \u201cSome definitely toe the line.\u201d\n\nMODERN PEPENo. issued: 100\n\nArt is often political, and good art nearly always provokes. But the specter of Pepe\u2019s past remains. Can the project navigate the tightrope between the perfect memory of the blockchain and the long memory of the internet? The topic comes up in the Rare Pepe Blockchain Trading group from time to time. A representative exchange: \u201cPepe is a symbol for Nazis,\u201d someone said. \u201cLol no,\u201d came a response. \u201cDid you know that since racists drive cars that cars are racist?\u201d someone else added sarcastically.\n\nRare Pepes are now catching the eyes of the art world\u2019s old guard, as well. In January, a digital art festival in New York City hosted an in-person auction of a one-of-a-kind Rare Pepe called \u201cHomer Pepe.\u201d It sold for $39,200. Vice reported that, during the auction, \u201cstaff from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and Sotheby\u2019s Institute of Art sat silently.\u201d\n\nBut for how long?\n\nComing this later week: How crypto-art and the blockchain could shape the future of art.\n\nAdditional development by Justin McCraw.", "author": ["Oliver Roeder"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-the-supreme-court-really-bust-public-sector-unions/", "published": "2018-02-26T11:01:54", "title": "Could The Supreme Court Really Bust Public-Sector Unions?", "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Monday in a case that\u2019s being billed as a potentially devastating blow to organized labor in the U.S. In Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31, the justices will decide whether laws in 22 states and the District of Columbia that allow public-sector unions to charge nonmembers fees for collective-bargaining activities violate the employees\u2019 free-speech rights.\n\nSupporters of the fees \u2014 including many Democrats, who receive funding from the labor movement \u2014 warn that such a decision could decimate unions\u2019 economic power and hurt workers as a result, while anti-union forces on the right say that these fears are overblown. But we don\u2019t really know what would happen in the long term if those fees were struck down, because the research doesn\u2019t paint a clear picture either way.\n\nEconomic theory does suggest an answer. For many economists, these fees \u2014 known as \u201cagency\u201d fees or \u201cfair share\u201d fees \u2014 are a necessary solution to a classic economic dilemma known as \u201cfree ridership.\u201d The thinking goes that because unions are required to advocate on behalf of all workers, not just their members, there\u2019s no reason for individual workers to pay for a benefit they could get for free. And if enough workers stopped paying dues, according to this reasoning, the unions would shrink, causing problems for the workers they support. But we can\u2019t always tell if the theory matches up with what happens in the real world. In the case of union fees, that\u2019s largely because there\u2019s no straightforward method that will allow the direct effects of the change to be observed.\n\nUnionization rates are generally lower across the board in states that have scrapped contribution requirements for public- and private-sector unions, known as \u201cright-to-work\u201d states. But critics of the fees say that doesn\u2019t mean that ending the mandatory fees is directly responsible for the decline of unions \u2014 or that some loss of union membership can justify restrictions on workers\u2019 free-speech rights. They argue that public-sector unions will survive in the absence of mandatory payments since they still exist in right-to-work states and that the unions can retain a significant percentage of the workforce as members even without requiring all workers to pay fees.\n\nThe issue of free ridership was also at play 40 years ago, when the Supreme Court ruled in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that the fees were constitutional for public-sector unions. Although it wasn\u2019t the central issue in that case, the court said the fees \u201ccounteract\u201d free riding. Today\u2019s justices are divided on how heavily to weigh this concern: In previous cases involving public-sector dues, Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, wrote that free-rider arguments are \u201cgenerally insufficient to overcome First Amendment objections,\u201d while Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, argued that \u201cendemic free-riding\u201d continues to provide justification for requiring payments from non-members.\n\nIn this case, the justices are being asked to overturn the precedent set in Abood, and it seems likely that they will. Critics of the unions say the problem isn\u2019t free riders \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cforced riders\u201d like plaintiff Mark Janus.\n\n\u201cAre you really receiving a benefit when you\u2019re being required to pay to support a view that you disagree with?\u201d said Robert Alt, president of the Buckeye Institute, a right-leaning think tank in Ohio. He argued that even though unions may see an initial loss in revenue, they can attract membership and stay influential in ways that don\u2019t involve a forced payment.\n\nBut Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard University, said that if Janus prevails, he expects significant numbers of public-sector employees to \u201cbail out\u201d over time and leave the unions with less revenue and workers with less support. \u201cThe unions might not disappear, but their power will be really diminished,\u201d he said. That\u2019s worrying, he said, because without strong unions, workers could see a decline in benefits and wages.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to figure out which workers are forced riders and which are free riders \u2014 and it\u2019s also challenging to determine what the impact of removing agency fees would actually be. To make their arguments, both sides in the case being heard Monday are drawing on a natural experiment that has been going on in the states for years \u2014 by comparing right-to-work and non-right-to-work states and by examining the results of states changing their policies on union fees. As with many natural experiments, though, disentangling the effects of a single policy difference from the myriad forces affecting something like wage growth can be nearly impossible.\n\nSince 2012, six states have enacted \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation that prohibits employment contracts from requiring union dues as a condition of employment. Twenty-two additional states have similar but less recent laws, while 22 states do not have right-to-work laws.\n\nIndividual studies have produced what seem like decisive answers to the question of what happens when the agency-fee requirement is removed \u2014 but taken together, they don\u2019t present a coherent narrative. Part of the problem is that when economists design studies to address this question, controlling for all the right factors is difficult. Right-to-work policies, for starters, exist alongside other pro-business policies, and disentangling whether a loss in, say, manufacturing jobs is related to the decline of the unions or something like competition from abroad is tricky.\n\nA 2011 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute examined differences between right-to-work states and states without right-to-work policies, controlling for the demographic and job characteristics of workers, as well as state-level economic conditions and differences in the cost of living. That study found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than wages in non-right-to-work states. A 2007 study by a professor at Hofstra University found, similarly, that employment and wages were lower in right-to-work states.\n\nBut another study, which controlled for economic conditions at the time the states adopted right-to-work, found that right-to-work laws were associated with higher wages in most cases. And other research has found that employment may be higher in right-to-work states, at least in some sectors. There may also be some variation by industry and worker demographics: For example, an examination of right-to-work laws in the Midwest found that they decreased wages for workers with two- or four-year college degrees, but had little to no impact for workers with graduate degrees or only high school degrees.\n\nA review of the empirical evidence surrounding right-to-work laws conducted by the Congressional Research Service in 2014 concluded that \u201ceven the most sophisticated studies are unable to fully isolate the effects\u201d of different agency-fee policies.\n\nThere is a general consensus among experts and advocates \u2014 including some opponents of the required payments \u2014 that if agency fees are struck down, public-sector unions will probably lose members and face diminished revenues in the short term. But some economists believe unions may be able to adapt and innovate in response, from changing how they negotiate agreements to the broader employment services they provide.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the unions might have to morph into a new kind of organization,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt they\u2019ll be weakened in the short term. The question is whether they\u2019ll be able to come back from that and continue offering substantial benefits to workers.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/black-panther-is-groundbreaking-but-its-shuri-who-could-change-the-world/", "published": "2018-02-16T19:37:41", "title": "\u2018Black Panther\u2019 Is Groundbreaking, But It\u2019s Shuri Who Could Change The World", "text": "\u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 which hit theaters on Thursday \u2014 is notable for a number of reasons. It is the first comic-book movie in decades to have a black protagonist. It was shot by one of the best directors of his generation and with an Oscar-nominated woman behind the camera. It is going to make a ton of money and potentially bust a number of pernicious myths about the international market and movies featuring people of color.\n\nBut I want to talk a little bit about Shuri.\n\nShuri (played by Letitia Wright ) is the sister of T\u2019Challa, the king of Wakanda and the film\u2019s titular character. She oversees the technological operations of the superscientific nation. If you\u2019re comparing T\u2019Challa to James Bond, she\u2019s Q.\n\nShe\u2019s also the funniest character in the movie, steals every scene she\u2019s in and \u2014 for my money \u2014 the most important character.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world. Black people have been historically underrepresented on screen, and black women in strong roles even more so. Shuri provides a science-y role model for black women, a group distinctly underrepresented in STEM fields.\n\nThis potential is essential to the character and factors into Wright\u2019s performance; the actress told Vogue: \u201cI hope it can spark someone to say, \u2018I\u2019m not a superhero, but I can be a scientist or build the next spaceship, like Shuri.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor example, a study titled \u201cIn Pursuit of the MD: The Impact of Role Models, Identity Compatibility, and Belonging Among Undergraduate Women\u201d in the journal Sex Roles found that when women in pre-med programs were exposed to short biographies of five successful female doctors, their interest in a career in medicine shot up (compared with a control group). More interestingly, their sense of belonging in their pre-med programs went up, as did their perception that their gender was compatible with their career aspirations.\n\nMovies can have an even longer lasting impact. A good movie changes the audience, and we have tons of evidence to back that up:\n\nMovies can also have direct, immediate effects on more mundane day-to-day decisions. Attendance at the American Museum of Natural History rose 20 percent after \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d came out, U.S. tourism to New Zealand increased 23 percent after \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d hit theaters, and Croatia\u2019s tourism business has been booming since \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d shot some scenes there. Or, how about this? Drivers seem more prone to speeding after The Fast and the Furious movies are released.\n\nI could go on, but the point is this: On the one hand, sure, movies are a product engineered to optimize financial windfalls for a small group of corporations and intellectual property holders. But on the other hand, I personally got interested in math because of Ian Malcolm, rock-star chaos theory mathematician in \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d and you would not be reading this if not for that.\n\nSo \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a big deal for a lot of reasons, but Shuri is chief among them.", "author": ["Walt Hickey"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/8-tips-to-improve-your-relationship-courtesy-of-international-relations/", "published": "2018-02-14T14:34:32", "title": "8 Tips To Improve Your Relationship, Courtesy Of International Relations", "text": "A big part of the science of international relations is the study of the causes of war. But it\u2019s also about how nations can cooperate \u2014 like signing treaties, providing aid and generally promising not to kill each others\u2019 citizens. It considers humans on the grandest, most violent scale \u2014 asking how we can overcome what might be a fundamentally selfish, fearful human nature to not just coexist but do better than we could alone.\n\nBut over 15 years of studying, researching and teaching international relations, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s also a deeply personal science, involving commitment, communication and trust. Those things can help reduce conflict and increase cooperation between nations \u2026 and people (in my experience, at least). So, seeing how it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, I bring you eight pieces of relationship advice courtesy of international relations.\n\n1. Say what you mean, and prove it\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard the adage that you should pay attention to what someone does, not what they say. International relations scholars agree. Countries that send \u201ccostly signals\u201d \u2014 taking an action that incurs some cost, such as moving troops away from a border or disabling a nuclear program \u2014 are better able to communicate their intentions in a convincing way to other countries.\n\nYou can see some of that idea at work on Valentine\u2019s Day: Buying roses makes that \u201cI love you\u201d more credible, said James Morrow, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan and co-author of \u201cThe Logic of Political Survival.\u201d \u201cAn engagement ring is also a costly signal,\u201d he added.\n\nYou can apply this idea to other areas of your relationship too. If you want your partner to believe that you\u2019ll finally make time for a vacation, for example, book the tickets.\n\n2. Have an audience\n\nProposing at a baseball game may seem cheesy and clich\u00e9, but there may be something to it. Leaders who generate \u201caudience costs\u201d \u2014 that is, they make public promises \u2014 tend to keep those promises more often than leaders who keep their intentions to themselves or confined to a small circle. The idea here is simple: accountability. The trick is you need an audience whose opinions matter to you. That\u2019s, in part, why democratic leaders are often better at keeping promises than authoritarian ones \u2014 the former are more accountable to their public.\n\nLikewise, you might consider proposing in front of your parents or a group of friends rather than a bunch of drunk strangers watching a ball game.\n\n3. Reciprocity is king\n\nMany scholars considered sustaining international cooperation without a central world government nearly impossible until they discovered the power of the simple rule of \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d: If another country does something nice for you, do something nice in return. They will then return the favor, then you will, and so on \u2014 until you\u2019re both living happily ever after.\n\nSo, if your partner takes out the trash this week, do it the following week, and you\u2019ll never have to discuss it again. Domestic bliss is yours! \u201cYou can also think about tit-for-tat as implicit punishment,\u201d said James Fearon, a professor of political science at Stanford University, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take out the trash, I\u2019ll stop walking the dog\u2026.\u201d\n\n4. But so is forgiveness\n\nOK, your partner didn\u2019t take out the trash last week. You\u2019re entitled to not take it out this week. But then, forgive and start over. Research shows that punishing someone repeatedly for one wrongdoing \u2014 similar to a strategy called \u201cgrim trigger\u201d \u2014 is less effective at sustaining long-term cooperation than just punishing a nation once and moving on.\n\n5. No disagreement is an island\n\nYour partner wants to use your first vacation in forever to go to the beach. But you want to go to the mountains. Stalemate! Well, maybe not. There are lots of creative ways to solve an impasse like this, including \u201cissue linkage\u201d \u2014 for example, where a person\u2019s advantage in one domain can be countered by providing a benefit to the other person in a different domain, making what would be an otherwise lousy outcome much better. Let\u2019s say Country A wants Country B to remove steel tariffs. Country B could agree, but only on the condition that Country A curbs its greenhouse gas emissions. So, go ahead and give in on the beach \u2014 but then you\u2019re entitled to not do the dishes for a week.\n\n6. Careful, conflict is easily escalated\n\nOne of the most enduring puzzles about war is that it breaks out even though both parties would be better off coming to a peaceful, negotiated settlement. The same thing can happen in relationships, where after a huge fight you wonder what it was you were fighting about in the first place.\n\nOne reason escalation is so easy in both scenarios is that there\u2019s a temptation for each side to bluff about how far they\u2019re willing to go to get the other side to back down. This is because each side has an incentive to act like they care more about getting their preferred outcome than the other side so that when the time comes to draw up an agreement, they get the better deal. The problem is, when both sides (rationally) pretend to care more than they do, they may find themselves in a position where they\u2019ve escalated and can\u2019t back down (thanks to the aforementioned audience costs, for example). In technical terms, this means they\u2019ve shrunk the bargaining range. Trump shouldn\u2019t threaten North Korea with a nuclear attack unless he\u2019s prepared to do it; likewise, don\u2019t threaten to move out unless you really think that\u2019s the solution.\n\n7. The right third party can help\n\nThird parties intervening in a dispute between two countries can help them keep peace, especially when the arbiter is seen as legitimate by both sides. Get a good therapist, and get everyone\u2019s buy-in.\n\n8. Even symbolic stuff can make a difference\n\nSome research suggests that signing an international agreement, like the Paris Climate Accord, can compel countries to change their behavior, but other research shows agreements only attract countries that are already following the rules. Marriage may operate the same way \u2014 it could change your behavior, but it\u2019s more likely only going to reflect the relationship as it is. Still, neither are necessarily useless \u2014 agreements of all kinds can serve as \u201cfocal points\u201d that clarify what kind of behavior the other is going to follow.\n\nSo there you have it! All of these are easier said than done, of course. We still see countries go to war and we still see couples fight. But these are the strategies people use to cope with \u201cuncertainty about the future and the intentions of others,\u201d Alexander Von Hagen-Jamar, a postdoctoral fellow at Lund University, said.\n\n\u201cLeaders of countries and people in relationships are both constantly wary of having their territories attacked or their hearts broken,\u201d said Sarah Croco, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland.\n\nYet, it all may be worth the risk of conflict if it helps us get to cooperation, because cooperation is more than just the absence of war. It means being able to accomplish things we can\u2019t alone \u2014 like operate an International Space Station or, you know, fall in love.", "author": ["Andrea Jones-Rooy"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-is-soaring-and-now-so-is-the-deficit-thats-a-bad-combination/", "published": "2018-02-14T10:58:42", "title": "The Economy Is Soaring, And Now So Is The Deficit. That\u2019s A Bad Combination.", "text": "Between costly tax cuts and last week\u2019s hefty spending bill, Congress is generating deficits that aren\u2019t just large, they\u2019re also unprecedented and potentially ominous. And even with some optimistic assumptions, President Trump\u2019s latest budget proposal wouldn\u2019t eliminate these deficits \u2014 in fact, the president is still angling to add a potentially costly infrastructure plan on top of current spending. But when the economy is this strong, deficits are usually small and shrinking, not ballooning back toward $1 trillion.\n\nWe are following a path that the country hasn\u2019t traveled since World War II, with green economic pastures alongside rivers of red deficit ink. And that combination carries unique risks \u2014 not because the numbers are especially large (during the early years of the Obama administration, the deficit regularly exceeded $1 trillion) but because these deficits provide unneeded stimulus, which can overheat an economy already operating near full capacity. And in the process, they drain away funding that might be better reserved for fighting off the next recession.\n\nCongress\u2019s don\u2019t-tax-but-spend approach is a root cause of the sizable deficit. Less than two months after Republicans passed a tax plan expected to cost the Treasury roughly $1.5 trillion, members of both parties agreed to raise spending by as much as $300 billion over two years, not including the new infrastructure and other spending increases in Trump\u2019s budget proposal. Resistance to these moves has been inconsistent, with just two members of the entire Republican caucus voting against both the tax cuts and the spending bill despite the fact that deficit reduction has been a GOP rallying cry for decades. Even famously deficit-averse House Speaker Paul Ryan signed on.\n\nBut in plum times, deficits this big carry real risks. To start with, financing these deficits will require the government to borrow more money via the bond market. And to attract enough investors, they may have to pay higher interest rates, in the form of higher bond yields. But that only makes the budget situation even worse, forcing the government to pay back its debt at higher rates.\n\nPrivate businesses would feel the squeeze, too. If the government starts paying higher interest on its bonds, companies will have to do the same for corporate bonds. That\u2019ll make it costlier for them to raise money, reducing investment and even dampening overall productivity.\n\nThis was less of a problem during the Great Recession and its aftermath because bond yields were held down by the Federal Reserve. Among other things, the Fed engaged in a massive bond-purchasing enterprise called quantitative easing, which created a kind of backstop to ensure that the government could find buyers without having to raise payouts.\n\nBut the situation has now reversed. The Fed is raising interest rates, selling off bonds and generally trying to restrain an economy that\u2019s growing at a pace the regulatory body fears may be unsustainable. And that means there is no backstop, just an environment where deficits could make it much more expensive for both government and private companies to borrow money.\n\nAnd this is just one potential issue. Perhaps the greater risk of rising deficits is that they make it harder for the U.S. to fight off the next recession, whenever it comes. Combating a recession generally requires a twofold approach: Rapid interest-rate cuts at the Federal Reserve to encourage borrowing and stimulus spending from Congress, both of which inject cash into the economy. But the Fed is in a weak position now. It can\u2019t cut rates by 4 or 5 percentage points, as it has in recent recessions, because interest rates aren\u2019t that far above zero right now \u2014 and the Fed\u2019s own projections suggest they won\u2019t get much higher, even over the long run.\n\nCongressional action is thus especially important, but here\u2019s where deficits get in the way. When Congress passed stimulative tax cuts during the recession of 2001 and boosted direct spending with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, they were starting from a position of relative comfort, as pre-recession budget deficits were either small or nonexistent. This time around, the U.S. is liable to enter its next recession with a substantial deficit, inflaming concerns that even necessary stimulus would be just too dangerous.\n\nTo appreciate just how unusual today\u2019s deficits are, consider that the last time the job market was comparably robust was in the mid-2000s, and at that time the deficit declined from 3.4 percent of the GDP in 2004 to 1.1 percent in 2007. One cycle earlier, when the unemployment rate hit a 30-year low in 2000, the U.S. actually ran a budget surplus.\n\nThe charts below plot both annual deficits and what\u2019s called the \u201coutput gap,\u201d a measure of how close the U.S. economy is to its full potential. And the story comes together in the bottom panel, where the march of dots leading up and to the right shows that from 1950 until very recently, the U.S. has stuck close to the same general pattern: When the economy approached \u2014 or sometimes exceeded \u2014 its growth potential, deficits tended to be small, or even to flip into surpluses. But when the economy weakened, as in the early Obama years, budget shortfalls widened, sometimes dramatically.\n\nWhat really stands out are the current projections, which show the U.S. walking into a deficit no-man\u2019s-land, an otherwise empty area where growth is above expectations and yet deficits remain large. Although, in the years since 1950, we\u2019ve had periods where the economy was stronger than today\u2019s, and others where deficits were larger, we\u2019ve never in that time seen a deficit this large in an economy this strong.\n\nBut the current deficits aren\u2019t going to vanish; they\u2019re expected to grow. Recent estimates from the Treasury Department show deficits increasing from $750 billion this year to just over $1 trillion by 2020. And while that does include the impact of tax cuts, a separate estimate from the bipartisan, pro-debt-reform Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget \u2014 which also accounts for last week\u2019s expensive budget agreement \u2014 puts the likely 2020 gap at $1.24 trillion.\n\nThe good news is that fixing the deficit problem is relatively straightforward, a matter of finding the right balance of spending cuts and tax increases. And now would seem a propitious time for either approach, given that the economy doesn\u2019t need any stimulus.\n\nBut deficit hawks seem to have become an endangered species in Washington, apparently outnumbered by the deficit shruggers, who\u2019ve grown inured to the prophecies of impending budget doom. Democrats warned of deficits during the tax cut debate, and some Republicans found their anti-deficit voices last week in a failed effort to block the spending bill \u2014 but these critiques seemed mostly opportunistic, a handy weapon for attacking your opponents\u2019 priorities that\u2019s quickly sheathed when pursuing your own.\n\nFor now, neither party seems willing to make deficit reduction a top priority, which worsens the odds of finding a solution \u2014 and lets the risk accumulate along with the debt.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-trump-or-the-democrats-be-more-worried-about-the-economy/", "published": "2018-02-07T10:58:30", "title": "Who Should Be More Freaked Out About The Economy \u2014 Trump Or The Democrats?", "text": "Who Should Be More Freaked Out About The Economy \u2014 Trump Or The Democrats?\n\nWelcome to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s weekly politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nmicah (Micah Cohen, politics editor): With the Dow nosedive on Monday, here\u2019s our topic for today:\n\nShould President Trump be freaking out about the stock market, and/or should Democrats be freaking out about the economy?\n\nLet\u2019s take those in order!\n\nclare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): Trump should be a little worried about how he\u2019s framed the stock market vis a vis his presidency.\n\nOn the Democratic side of things \u2026 I have no idea, to be honest! In some ways, I could see it helping them politically.\n\nmicah: Let\u2019s focus on the Trump part first.\n\nnatesilver (Nate Silver, editor in chief): But I think both sides should be freaking out, in the sense that the economy is likely to be more important to the midterms than a lot of stuff people freak out about.\n\njulia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): It\u2019s lucky for Trump that it\u2019s happening now and not in like October 2020.\n\nclare.malone: But wait, don\u2019t financial reporters keep telling me that the fundamentals of the economy are still relatively strong?\n\nmicah: Yeah, I don\u2019t think both sides should be freaking out. That can\u2019t be right.\n\nnatesilver: Wait, what do you mean? The economy could have a large impact on 2018 (and a larger one on 2020) and there\u2019s a pretty clear upside and downside case for both parties.\n\nSo it may not be a bad thing if we had more news cycles devoted to the economy and fewer to the fuckin\u2019 Nunes memo. For instance.\n\nmicah: Can we back up a moment? Can someone give a super brief primer on how the economy affects voters?\n\nIn general, good economic news helps Trump/Republicans and hurts Democrats because Trump/Republicans are the incumbent party (they control the White House and Congress), right?\n\nnatesilver: OMG\n\n\u201cSlack Chats for Dummies\u201d\n\nOf course good economic news helps the incumbent party.\n\nclare.malone: OK, but can we differentiate for the dummies whether we think this stock market thing will be bad for Trump in the long run? Because, as previously stated, people keep telling me not to worry too much about a crash of the market as long as other economic factors are stable.\n\nAnd I am one of those dummies, to be clear.\n\njulia_azari: So, election models based on fundamentals like the economy tend to focus on employment, real income or GDP.\n\nThere is also a school of thought that suggests that people\u2019s perceptions of how the economy is doing \u2014 not their own personal income/economic situations \u2014 matter for how likely they are to punish the incumbent party at the ballot box.\n\nA flood of bad economic news, even if combined with a sweet $1.50 raise each week, could change those perceptions.\n\nnatesilver: I have Very Strong Feelings about fundamentals models in this context.\n\nSpecifically that I think trying to specify exactly which economic variables move public perceptions is a fool\u2019s errand. And that most of the attempts to do so reflect overfitting and p-hacking.\n\njulia_azari: But, like, conceptually, can\u2019t we sorta posit that the stock market is different from, say, unemployment?\n\nnatesilver: Historically the unemployment rate has one of the weakest relationships with presidential popularity.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because people look at trends rather than levels. So if the unemployment rate goes from 4 percent to 5 percent, that might actually be worse for the president\u2019s party than if it goes from 8 percent to 7 percent.\n\nAnyway, in my view, the \u201ccorrect\u201d view of the relationship between the economy and elections is as follows:\n\nThe economy matters more than a lot of things, but is not deterministic; A better economy helps the incumbent party, other things held equal; There\u2019s no one economic magic bullet \u2014 you have to look at a broad series of economic indicators across various segments of the economy; Both perception and reality matter and it\u2019s not always clear which is more important; Trends matter more than levels; People have a relatively short time horizon for evaluating economic performance.\n\njulia_azari: I\u2019m disappointed to admit that I mostly agree with all of that. Can I talk about Trump?\n\nmicah: Yeah, so let\u2019s grant all that. Isn\u2019t the correct view, based on all that, to dismiss the Dow plummet as something Trump shouldn\u2019t worry about?\n\nWe know the stock market does not equal the economy. Especially the Dow!\n\nnatesilver: No, not at all. It could affect perceptions a lot. It\u2019s a trend rather than a level. And it\u2019s very salient and news-y.\n\nmicah: It\u2019s a one-day drop, Nate!\n\nnatesilver: Wait, you\u2019re strawmanning me again, Micah.\n\nYou just switched me from \u201cThe stock market could matter\u201d to \u201cYesterday\u2019s one-day drop does matter.\u201d\n\nmicah: \u201cIt\u2019s a trend,\u201d said Nate Silver.\n\nnatesilver: A prolonged period of volatility \u2014 with mostly downward-shifting numbers \u2014 could matter a lot.\n\nIf this week is a one-off, much less so.\n\nmicah: Ah, OK.\n\njulia_azari: The Dow is not only news-y but measurable in dramatic-sounding numbers. (I still have very vivid memories of the Dow reaching some benchmark in the 1990s. I was in high school and knew even less than I know now about stocks, but I remember it being a huge news story.)\n\nAlso, I think a downturn splits the Trump coalition \u2014 or at least has the potential to.\n\nTrump has a very delicate political coalition of the people who liked him in the primary, and those who didn\u2019t but voted for him in the general anyway. It\u2019s not clear that his primary supporters were necessarily poorer than people who preferred other candidates (per some work Nate did at the time). So what made reluctant Trump voters vote for him in the general election in 2016? Some of Clare\u2019s work shows that the economy is a priority for this group. If we\u2019re looking at stories about why Trump was able to consolidate (more or less) the Republican coalition, you have a combo of the cultural folks and the outcome-oriented/economy-focused folks. The latter group came to Trump reluctantly, but perhaps liked that he was a businessman, and saw him (or any Republican) as good for the economy. I see this as a vulnerability in his coalition. The cultural Trumpists, on the other hand, are pretty happy.\n\nnatesilver: I agree with that. I think Trump\u2019s sales pitch on being a competent manager of the economy is pretty important to a fairly wide group of voters. And it\u2019s also fairly important that the economy has, in fact, done fairly well.\n\nclare.malone: That is interesting. Those reluctant Trump voters, as we started calling them, might see a trend form over a couple of months \u2014 if this is the start of something \u2014 and that could help them form opinions that could, say, affect the midterms.\n\nnatesilver: One thing to note is that consumer confidence is quite high. Not only high in an absolute sense, but also high relative to merely good-ish numbers in other sectors.\n\nPeople feel fairly bullish, and it seems like Trump is a part of that.\n\njulia_azari: So I heard one of Trump\u2019s campaign advisers speak in January, and he basically started out with the stock market as a key justification for the administration\u2019s first year\n\nmicah: Yeah, I think our reluctant Trump voters would be the most vulnerable part of his coalition if the economy went south in any real way.\n\nclare.malone: By the way, I feel it\u2019s pertinent to point out that if you go to, say, the Fox News website, not much stock market coverage.\n\nmicah: Agreed, Clare.\n\nI don\u2019t think the economy washes away partisanship in any wholesale way. At the margins, maybe.\n\nnatesilver: But if you watch Fox News, there\u2019s a stock market ticker, right? (There\u2019s one on the website too.)\n\nclare.malone: Sure, and there\u2019s still some coverage of it:\n\nStuart Varney: \u201cThe sky is not falling\u2026There is no economic catastrophe on the horizon.\u201d pic.twitter.com/8we7ZIsDCm \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) February 6, 2018\n\nBut I do think a lot of their stuff is still about the Nunes memo.\n\nmicah: The reluctant Trump voter logic I think is like this (remember, these are people who voted for Trump but simultaneously said they had an unfavorable view of him): \u201cI\u2019m very uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s behavior, but he\u2019ll be good for business/the economy and I didn\u2019t want to vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThat logic has mostly worked for Year 1.\n\nThe behavior is still super problematic, but the trade-off worked for them.\n\njulia_azari: (Also Neil Gorsuch.)\n\nmicah: Right.\n\nIf the economy part falls out of it \u2026 he\u2019s in trouble.\n\nnatesilver: I have another theory too. Do you want to hear it?\n\nclare.malone: No.\n\nmicah: lol\n\nclare.malone: Kidding. Nate, spout.\n\nnatesilver: I\u2019ll warn you in advance that it\u2019s completely unprovable.\n\nclare.malone: LOVE THOSE\n\nnatesilver: Or not unprovable, but unproven.\n\njulia_azari: Perfect!\n\nnatesilver: My hunch is that one reason why Trump\u2019s approval has risen lately is that people are responding to a \u201csky is falling\u201d mentality from the media and Democrats.\n\nReluctant Trumpers are responding to it, that is.\n\nDemocrats can huff and puff, but as long as nothing breaks, nothing blows up and no one gets fired, it might seem like a lot of hot air.\n\nmicah: Oh, I don\u2019t buy that at all.\n\nclare.malone: Well, it\u2019s interesting\n\nmicah: I don\u2019t think voters, including reluctant Trump voters, have opinions about media approaches that are strong enough to affect their political outlook.\n\nclare.malone: I had a friend, who is a Democrat, recently bring up the Department of Labor\u2019s decision to remove data that adversely affected the administration\u2019s position from a proposal to change tip-pooling rules. And he said the Democrats should be messaging hard about all these economic rule changes and how they could adversely affect the working (wo)man, as it were.\n\nNot just about the Trump stuff.\n\nnatesilver: But Trump often makes the argument that, e.g., the media never brings up good news. Or that the Russia stuff is a bunch of baloney.\n\nAnd the question is \u2014 what tangible evidence do voters who are not partisan Democrats have to prove him wrong?\n\njulia_azari: Maybe there is a sort of closing of ranks among people who we might consider reluctant Trumpers. They liked Marco Rubio (or whoever) better in the primary, but they feel like the culture has shifted in this really uncomfortable way into a lot of anti-Trump virtue signaling in media and among corporate entities.\n\nAnd this leads them to rally around Trump/Republicans in a way they might not otherwise do. This is compatible with what Nate just said, right?\n\nmicah: It is, yeah.\n\nBut I\u2019m skeptical.\n\nI do think Clare\u2019s Democratic friend is right, though.\n\nclare.malone: He said something along the lines of, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t catch fire right away, the Democrats don\u2019t pursue it.\u201d\n\nI do think people tire of the virtue signaling. Democrats too, I\u2019d think, in some ways \u2014 i.e., Democrats who aren\u2019t the hardcore, Indivisible volunteers types.\n\njulia_azari: Yeah. So there\u2019s some interesting work in political science that backs this up a bit. I was just at a conference with Lilliana Mason of the University of Maryland, and her research illustrates how much people are motivated by protecting their group status and identity.\n\nmicah: Yeah. And there\u2019s truth to the idea that Democrats are shit at building an argument.\n\nnatesilver: That\u2019s overrated.\n\nmicah: I didn\u2019t even rate it! I just think it\u2019s true \u2014 the extent to which it matters is another question.\n\nnatesilver: I mean, there are times when it\u2019s right. Like, Democrats\u2019 messaging was kind of shit during the shutdown, even though they started out with more people blaming Republicans by default.\n\nSomebody wrote \u2014 I forget who, but I was very jealous of the post \u2014 that it\u2019s actually an advantage not to have a clear message at the midterm because it\u2019s one less thing you can be attacked on.\n\nclare.malone: Yeah, but \u2026 it\u2019s not like breaking news that Democrats try to fashion themselves as the party of the working (wo)man, historically.\n\nI find that a little facile.\n\njulia_azari: \u201cDemocrats suck at messaging\u201d is one of the journalistic tropes that needs to be interrogated.\n\nnatesilver: A healthy economy is very important to Trump\u2019s message, though.\n\nmicah: OK, let me ask this: Assuming the economy keeps chugging along (and I think that\u2019s probably the safest assumption at this point?), to what extent does that tamp down Democratic gains?\n\nOr, does the economy matter to voters less than normal because Trump is so atypical in other ways?\n\nnatesilver: It gives Trump and Republicans an argument.\n\nA credible argument. Something to hang their hat on.\n\njulia_azari: Well, his approval rating is lower than the economy would predict.\n\nAnd there\u2019s been a ton of Republican retirements despite the good economy.\n\nclare.malone: If we think midterms are about getting an anti-Trump turnout from the Democratic base \u2014 because they\u2019re eager to win back Congress so they can impeach him \u2014 I think it matters less.\n\nnatesilver: That cuts both ways. On the one hand, voters obviously have a lot of information to weigh and there are fewer swing voters than there used to be. On the other hand, a healthy economy is pretty important for a sense of normalcy, and Republicans don\u2019t have a lot of other good arguments to make.\n\nmicah: How many voters would agree with this article from The Atlantic, which argued that \u201cthe best hope of defending the country from Trump\u2019s Republican enablers, and of saving the Republican Party from itself, is to \u2026 vote mindlessly and mechanically against Republicans at every opportunity, until the party either rights itself or implodes (very preferably the former)\u201d?\n\njulia_azari: The two who wrote it.\n\nclare.malone: lol\n\nmicah: Like, what if it\u2019s November 2018 and GDP growth is 6 percent and special counsel Robert Mueller has come back with an obstruction of justice finding and some type of not-clear-cut collusion case?\n\n(Six percent is obviously ridiculous, but you see what I\u2019m getting at.)\n\nnatesilver: Then Trump and Republicans have a pretty good argument to make.\n\njulia_azari: To think of it a different way, Republicans suffered big midterm losses in 1982 (after a serious economic downturn) and in 2006 (with an unpopular war). Is anything that\u2019s going on now that bad? We don\u2019t know, but opposition to Trump has been pretty clear and well-organized. And, unlike Trump, neither Ronald Reagan in 1980 nor George W. Bush in 2004 lost the popular vote.\n\nmicah: I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is \u2026 does a good economy preclude a Democratic wave or just make it more unlikely?\n\njulia_azari: Less likely, but still possible.\n\nnatesilver: If you want to get fairly technical, I think the risks might be slightly asymmetric. A better economy somewhat helps Trump, but a bad economy could really hurt him. That\u2019s sort of been true for most presidents, by the way \u2014 it isn\u2019t anything unique to Trump. Sometimes other factors can overcome a good economy and make a president unpopular. But it\u2019s very hard for a president to be popular amidst a bad economy, unless he\u2019s inherited it and isn\u2019t seen as responsible.\n\nBut the thing is \u2026 it\u2019s not that easy for Democrats to flip the House and the Senate, given the Senate map and the way districts are drawn. So having a little bit of a wind at his back, in the form of the economy, might be enough for Trump.\n\njulia_azari: If Democrats are fired up and Republicans aren\u2019t, that might have wave implications. To put it another way, were the two successive waves during Obama\u2019s presidency about the economy? Or about strong responses to Obama, with his voters being less motivated to come out and defend Democratic candidates?\n\nmicah: Both?\n\nOK, we gotta wrap. Final thoughts?\n\nclare.malone: I still need to read more about the state of our economic fundamentals, but I think that we all need to be keeping an eye on the business section over the next few months.\n\njulia_azari: It\u2019s February. At this time two years ago, we were still trying to figure out which establishment Republican would pull ahead in the primaries. A lot can change.\n\nnatesilver: My final thought is that my lunch order is late and my stomach needs a stimulus.", "author": ["A Fivethirtyeight Chat"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/could-a-stock-market-downturn-tank-trumps-approval-rating/", "published": "2018-02-05T23:29:10", "title": "Could A Stock Market Downturn Tank Trump\u2019s Approval Rating?", "text": "The stock market fell on Monday. A lot. After a roller-coaster day, the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1,175 points, making for the largest single-day point decline in its history.\n\nIn percentage terms, the decline isn\u2019t nearly as bad \u2014 the 4.6 percent drop is well short of the record 22.6 percent sell-off that occured on Oct. 19, 1987, otherwise known as \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d The Dow would have had to lose almost 5,700 points on Monday to equal Black Monday on a percentage basis.\n\nBut it\u2019s likely that there will be further volatility in the days ahead. The Dow had a very good first few weeks of January, gaining almost 2,000 points and peaking at an all-time closing high of 26,616.71 on Jan. 26. The index has given up all of its 2018 gains and then some since then, however. Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange\u2019s VIX, a measure of implied volatility in stock prices over the next 30 days, spiked dramatically on Monday to finish its session at 37.3 points, a level rarely seen since the end of the financial crisis.\n\nThis is usually the point at which I\u2019d pause to deliver various pedantic admonitions about the stock market. For instance, I\u2019d tell you that the Dow isn\u2019t a very good stock market index as compared to broader and more robustly constructed ones such as the S&P 500, which declined by slightly less on Monday. I\u2019d also tell you that the stock market isn\u2019t always a very good proxy for the nation\u2019s overall economic health. In fact, the latest decline in share prices has been triggered, in part, by fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates because of strong wage and job growth. Good pocketbook news for workers can sometimes be bad news for investors, and vice versa.\n\nI\u2019m someone who writes about politics, however \u2014 and in political terms, the decline in the Dow is potentially important. President Trump has spent lots of time bragging about the stock market over the past year, from dozens and dozens of references in his Twitter feed to a riff about it in last week\u2019s State of the Union address. Moreover, the stock market is a highly visible economic indicator. Sure, something like real disposable income per capita might be a better overall measure of economic well-being. But the Dow gets mentioned a lot more often on the evening news.\n\nOverall, the stock market still looks pretty good for Trump, with the Dow having gained 23 percent during his presidency so far. But could a further reversal in those gains harm his approval ratings, which have been improving lately? Trump\u2019s approval rating is now 40.4 percent in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s index \u2014 not good, but the highest it has been since May 15.\n\nThe short answer is, sure, there could be some risk to Trump. One should not necessarily expect there to be an obvious one-to-one correlation, however. After Black Monday in 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Gallup approval rating actually improved to 51 percent from 49 percent two months earlier. The point is not that Black Monday helped Reagan \u2014 it probably didn\u2019t \u2014 but that whatever effect it had was swamped by other news events, plus whatever random statistical noise there was in the polling average. My past research also suggests that stock market growth has historically been a fairly weak predictor of a president\u2019s odds of being re-elected.\n\nMore recent academic research has found that there probably is some relationship between presidential approval ratings and the stock market, however. Furthermore, there\u2019s fairly robust evidence linking overall economic performance to presidential approval.\n\nI\u2019m marginally skeptical of these studies, but only because it\u2019s difficult to separate out the influence of the stock market (or any other economic indicator) from the rest of the economy. The present sell-off aside, there usually is some correlation between the stock market and other measures of economic well-being. The massive stock-market decline in 2008 was indicative of much broader problems with the economy, for example. Studies that take a bunch of highly correlated variables (e.g., the stock market, unemployment, inflation, consumer confidence, etc.) and attempt to correlate them with another variable (e.g., presidential approval) can run into all sorts of methodological problems such as overfitting.\n\nIn other words, there are lots of reasons to think there\u2019s a reasonably strong relationship between economic performance and presidential popularity. It\u2019s very difficult to say which particular indicators the public cares most about, however. (The approach we take for FiveThirtyEight\u2019s election forecasts, which are partly based on economic data, is essentially to average a bunch of economic indicators together \u2014 including the S&P 500 \u2014 but weigh them equally.)\n\nMoreover, the relative importance of different economic indicators can change from presidency to presidency, based on which ones that politicians and the media are talking about and which have had more visible effects lately. Inflation was a much more salient political topic during the 1970s and 1980s than it is now, for example.\n\nBut therein lies the risk to Trump. He has frequently highlighted the stock market \u2014 something that President Obama rarely did, by contrast, even though the Dow rose by almost 140 percent during Obama\u2019s two terms in office. If it continues to decline, it will be tough for Trump to dismiss its significance. Nor will he be able to cast doubt on the reliability of the numbers, since the price of a stock is not a government-created statistic and is simply a market price.\n\nMost presidents avoid talking about the stock market because of its unpredictability and volatility. In an era of algorithmic trading, there\u2019s some relatively minor piece of economic news, and voila! \u2014 the Dow can swing by 2,000 points in a few weeks or several hundred points in a day. By contrast, although macroeconomic conditions are not highly predictable at intervals more than about six months in advance \u2014 it\u2019s too soon to know quite what the economy will look like at the midterms \u2014 we\u2019re at least talking about changes that play out at intervals that span months to years and not days to weeks. U.S. GDP, currently $17.3 trillion, is extraordinarily unlikely to jump to $20.8 trillion or $13.8 trillion next month (a 20 percent increase or decline, respectively). But if the Dow were 20 percent higher or lower a month from today, it wouldn\u2019t be any enormous surprise. Trump should probably stick to bragging about jobs and wage growth, because those numbers have also been pretty good and the gains are more likely to hold.", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-much-from-a-state-of-the-union-usually-becomes-law/", "published": "2018-01-31T21:28:38", "title": "Not Much From A State Of The Union Usually Becomes Law", "text": "President Trump on Tuesday gave the first State of the Union address of his presidency, calling for new legislation in policy areas including immigration, infrastructure, prescription drugs and military spending.

They analyzed how successful past presidents have been at turning State of the Union policy announcements into law. We wrote about their research in May 2015, and Hoffman and Howard were kind enough to send us updated data.\n\nFrom Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama, according to Hoffman and Howard, presidents made an average of 34 proposals in each State of the Union or initial address to a joint session of Congress. The most requests a president made during this period were Bill Clinton\u2019s 87 in 2000. The fewest were just nine by Jimmy Carter in 1980.\n\nAbout 25 percent of policy announcements were ultimately successful, according to Hoffman and Howard\u2019s definition of success, which is a complete enactment of the president\u2019s recommended policy within a year of the address. They grade 14 percent more as partial successes \u2014 times when the president got a portion of the policy he asked for. The average policy agenda success rate increased to 32.7 percent when a president\u2019s party controlled both houses of Congress, which Trump\u2019s does.\n\nAltogether, an average of 60.6 percent of policy proposals mentioned in the State of the Union never materialized, suggesting that any one request from Trump is more likely not to be turned into legislation.

We cared only about outcomes, not what produced them. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency so far: Some things are going his way, but many results, both good and bad, are a continuation of trends that began well before Trump took office.\n\nNo. 1: Manufacturing jobs\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: More manufacturing jobs\n\nHow we measured it: Seasonally adjusted employment in the manufacturing sector\n\nThe U.S. added 184,000 manufacturing jobs in 2017. That\u2019s an increase of 1.5 percent over 11 months, which is slightly larger than the average annual increase since 2010 (1.1 percent), the first full year after the recession officially ended in 2009. Overall, the country now has 12.5 million manufacturing jobs, which is more than at any point since 2009 but still well below the levels we saw before the recession and in past decades.\n\nNo. 2: Coal jobs\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: More coal industry jobs\n\nHow we measured it: Seasonally adjusted employment in the coal mining sector\n\nCoal jobs increased from January through the fall of Trump\u2019s first year, but then dipped back down, meaning just 500 more people were working in coal mines at the end of December than had been in January. This increase continued a brief trend that began about a month before the election \u2014 the number of coal jobs dropped through most of 2016, bottoming out in September and then growing slightly through the end of the year. Still, the country doesn\u2019t have nearly the number of coal jobs it once did \u2014 the number of people working in that industry has shrunk by more than a third since the end of the recession.\n\nNo. 3: The trade deficit\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: A smaller trade deficit\n\nHow we measured it: The trade deficit as a share of U.S. gross domestic product\n\nThe deficit was essentially unchanged in 2017, according to our measure. We checked the size of the deficit (nominal exports minus nominal imports, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate) as a percentage of the gross domestic product, and that number shrank very slightly from 3.06 percent of the GDP to 3.04 percent last year. During Obama\u2019s two terms, the deficit varied from 2.4 percent of the GDP at its narrowest to 3.8 at its widest, averaging 3.1 percent over the full eight years. The U.S. has continuously run a trade deficit since the \u201980s, and Trump hasn\u2019t had much effect on it yet.\n\nNo. 4: Prime-age employment rate\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: More jobs for Americans\n\nHow we measured it: The share of the U.S. population aged 25-54 that is employed (often called prime-age employment)\n\nThe percentage of people aged 25-54 who had jobs increased from 78.2 percent to 78.9 percent \u2014 a rise of 0.7 percentage points \u2014 between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31, 2017. Between 2010, the first full year after the recession, and the end of the Obama administration, it increased an average of 0.4 percentage points per year. The prime-age employment rate is now approaching pre-recession levels: In November of 2007, the last month before the official start of the recession, 79.9 percent of 25-to-54-year-olds were employed.\n\nNo. 5: U.S. murders\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: Less violent crime\n\nHow we measured it: Number of murders in big cities\n\nThe FBI has yet to release the full crime statistics for 2017, so we turned to FiveThirtyEight contributor Jeff Asher, who keeps data on murder for U.S. cities with a population of more than 250,000.\n\nAsher\u2019s data includes the number of murders in all of 2017 for 43 cities. The combined total number of murders for those cities decreased 2.6 percent from 2016 to 2017. During the Obama administration \u2014 from 2009 through 2016 \u2014 the number of murders in those same cities increased on average by 1.2 percent per year. That was largely driven by big jumps in murders in 2015 and 2016 (the numbers actually fell in the first three years of Obama\u2019s administration).\n\nNo. 6: Health care uninsurance rate\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: To repeal the Affordable Care Act without increasing the share of uninsured Americans\n\nHow we measured it: Percentage of adults in the U.S. without primary health insurance\n\nAlthough multiple efforts by Republicans to get rid of Obamacare failed, Congress did vote to repeal one of the law\u2019s key provisions via last December\u2019s tax bill: the individual mandate, which requires most people to have health insurance or pay a fine. The repeal doesn\u2019t take effect until 2019, however, so it\u2019ll take a few years before we can see how that change affects this metric. Even without the mandate repeal, insurance coverage went down under Trump. According to Gallup, between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2017, the share of uninsured Americans increased by 1.3 percentage points, from 10.9 percent to 12.2 percent.\n\nNo. 7: U.S. oil and gas production\n\nTrump\u2019s goal: Increase U.S. oil and gas production\n\nHow we measured it: Monthly data on crude oil production and natural gas production\n\nBy October of 2017, the U.S. was producing 812,000 more barrels of oil per day than it was in January, an increase of 9.2 percent. U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, was 5.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in October than in January, an increase of 5.8 percent.\n\nThe annual average growth rate of oil production during the Obama administration was 7.3 percent. By comparison, natural gas production grew at an average of 2.5 percent annually during Obama\u2019s time in office.\n\nThe upshot? Few dramatic changes in either direction. Jobs in the manufacturing and coal mining industries ticked up, the trade deficit shrank a bit, and the number of murders in some big cities decreased. The uninsurance rate got worse \u2014 the only change in the opposite direction of Trump\u2019s goal. The biggest movement in the direction Trump hoped to see was the increase in oil and natural gas production.\n\nSo, according to these measures, Trump has had a reasonably good year. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean Trump was personally responsible for all of this change \u2014 in fact, many of these trends began long before Trump was elected. But presidents often get credited with whatever happens while they\u2019re in office anyway.", "author": ["Andrea Jones-Rooy", "Rachael Dottle"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/to-cut-the-debt-the-gop-should-focus-on-health-care-costs/", "published": "2018-01-11T10:58:23", "title": "The GOP Plan To Overhaul Entitlements Misses The Real Problem", "text": "Energized by the successful passage of tax cuts, some Republicans are eying a new target: entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. House Speaker Paul Ryan is leading the charge, arguing that the only way to break the cycle of rising deficits and surging debt is to reduce entitlement spending.\n\nPolitical resistance is likely to be fierce, not only because these programs are massively popular, but also because President Trump opposed any such cuts during his campaign. Even if the political hurdles can be cleared, though, the bigger problem is that this push for entitlement reform attacks the wrong target.\n\nThere is no wide-reaching entitlement funding crisis, no deep-rooted connection between runaway debts and the broad suite of pension and social welfare programs that usually get called entitlements. The problem is linked to entitlements, but it\u2019s much narrower: If the U.S. budget collapses after hemorrhaging too much red ink, the main culprit will be rising health care costs.\n\nAside from health care, entitlement spending actually looks relatively manageable. Social Security will get a little more expensive over the next 30 years; welfare and anti-poverty programs will get a little cheaper. But costs for programs like Medicare and Medicaid are expected to climb from the merely unaffordable to truly catastrophic.\n\nPart of that has to do with our aging population, but age isn\u2019t the biggest issue. In a hypothetical world where the population of seniors citizens didn\u2019t increase, entitlement-related health spending would still soar to unprecedented heights \u2014 thanks to the relentlessly accelerating cost of medical treatments for people of all ages.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed, then, is something far more focused than entitlement reform: an aggressive effort to slow the growth of per-person health care costs. Or \u2014 if that\u2019s not possible \u2014 some way to ensure that the economy grows at least as fast as the cost of health care does.\n\nDiagnosing the debt: It\u2019s not about demographics\n\nAmerica\u2019s long-term budget problem is very real. Already, the federal government has a pile of publicly held debts amounting to around $15 trillion, or about 75 percent of the country\u2019s entire gross domestic product. That\u2019s the highest level since the 1940s, yet the debt burden is expected to double by 2047 and reach 150 percent of the GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIt makes sense to list entitlement spending among the culprits for the growing national debt, given that these programs have grown from costing less than 10 percent of the GDP in 2000 to a projected 18 percent in 2047. Part of this is simple demographics: As America ages, more of us become eligible for Social Security and Medicare, thus driving up expenses.\n\nBut there\u2019s a crack in this demographic explanation: It only makes sense for the next 10 to 15 years. That\u2019s the period of rapid transition when graying baby boomers will boost the population of seniors from around 50 million to more than 70 million. A change like that should indeed produce a surge in entitlement spending as those millions submit their enrollment forms.\n\nBy 2030, however, this wave will start to ebb, leaving the elderly share of the population at a roughly stable 20 to 21 percent all the way through 2060, based on the size of the population following the boomers and slower-moving forces like lengthening lifespans.\n\nBut think what this should mean for entitlement spending. As the population of seniors levels out in those later years, costs should naturally stabilize \u2014 at least, if demographics were really the driving factor.\n\nThis is exactly what you see for Social Security. The CBO expects total Social Security spending to leap up over the next decade but then settle at just over 6 percent of the GDP, at which point it will cease to be a major contributor to rising entitlement spending or growing debts. Social Security is thus a minor player in our long-term budget drama; if you cut the program to the bone, shrinking future payouts so that they won\u2019t add a penny to the deficit, the federal debt would still reach 111 percent of the GDP in 2047.\n\nLikewise, cuts to welfare and poverty-related entitlements like food stamps and unemployment insurance are unlikely to improve the debt forecast. In fact, spending on these entitlements has been dropping since the high-need years around the Great Recession and is expected to shrink further in the decades ahead \u2014 partly because payouts aren\u2019t adjusted to keep up with economic growth, and partly because the birth rate has been falling and several programs are geared to families with children.\n\nBut the scale of the problem is totally different when you turn to health care. Spending on entitlement-related health programs \u2014 including Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies required by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 will never shrink or stabilize, according to projections. The CBO predicts these costs will grow over 65 percent between now and 2047 \u2014 and then go right on growing after that, heedless of the fact that the percentage of the population that\u2019s over 65 should no longer be increasing.\n\nWhy is health care eating the budget? Per-person costs\n\nDemographics aren\u2019t responsible for the projected explosion in health care costs. More important than the growing number of elderly Americans is the growing cost per patient \u2014 the rising expense of treating each individual\n\nThe CBO found that the lion\u2019s share \u2014 60 percent \u2014 of the projected increase in health spending comes from costs that would continue to increase even if our population weren\u2019t getting older.\n\nThe reasons for this are many, including the rising cost of prescription drugs and the fact that hospital mergers have reduced competition. But since 2000, per capita health costs in the U.S. have, on average, grown faster than the GDP. And while these costs rose more slowly after the Great Recession and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, analysis from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services suggests this slower growth rate won\u2019t last.\n\nWhich is bad news for these programs, because if the problem were demographic, it\u2019d be easier to solve. By mixing the kind of program cuts Republicans generally support with targeted tax increases favored by some Democrats, you could meet the short-term challenge posed by retiring baby boomers and raise enough money to cover the larger \u2014 but stabilizing \u2014 population of eligible seniors. But with ever-rising costs, there is no stable future to prepare for. To keep these programs funded, you\u2019d need a wholly different approach \u2014 indeed a whole new perspective on mounting federal debt and the role of entitlements.\n\nThe future is a race between rising health care costs and economic growth, a race that the economy is losing. Each time health costs outpace the GDP, it creates what the CBO calls \u201cexcess cost growth,\u201d which feeds the federal debt. If the government could close this gap, the long-term budget outlook would be a lot rosier.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this issue: Either contain health care costs \u2014 say through price regulation or more competitive markets \u2014 or boost economic growth enough to pay for this expensive health care. Success on either front would make health care spending look more manageable over future decades and lighten the debt load.\n\nEntitlement reform needs health care reform to work\n\nFew of the proposals that commonly fall under the heading of entitlement reform target the health care cost problem, which limits their ability to reduce the long-term debt.\n\nEven when they do address health care, often the result is to shift \u2014 rather than solve \u2014 the problem. Say lawmakers decide to dramatically cut Medicare. That would indeed ease the government\u2019s debt problem. But the underlying dynamic \u2014 the race between health costs and the GDP \u2014 wouldn\u2019t really change. Seniors would still need health care, and per-person costs would likely still grow (maybe even faster, since Medicare is a relatively efficient program).\n\nOn top of all this, there\u2019s also a deep-seated political barrier: It\u2019s no good if one party picks its favored solution only to watch the other party dismantle it when they next take over. You need political consensus to make changes stick, and America is notably short on consensus right now.\n\nIn the end, though, it won\u2019t do to just throw up our hands. Absent some workable solution, spending on health care will sink the federal budget, generating levels of debt that would hold back the economy and potentially spark a global crisis of confidence in the United States\u2019 ability to borrow.\n\nIf Republicans are serious about addressing this challenge and reducing America\u2019s debt, they need to find an approach to entitlement reform that can both reduce out-of-control health costs and also survive under Democratic governance.", "author": ["Evan Horowitz"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-hope-we-do-this-much-cool-stuff-in-2018/", "published": "2017-12-29T13:28:20", "title": "We Hope We Do This Much Cool Stuff In 2018", "text": "We Hope We Do This Much Cool Stuff In 2018\n\nAs the FiveThirtyEight staff recovers from a hectic year of news, we\u2019ve been reflecting on our favorite stories from the past 12 months. What follows is not a comprehensive list of our best work, but it is some of what has lingered in our minds as we get ready for 2018.\n\nOur editor in chief, Nate Silver, started the year like many others: trying to make sense of the 2016 presidential election. He wrote a dozen essays about what happened, including entries on President Trump\u2019s superior Electoral College strategy, the media\u2019s probability problem and \u201cthe Comey letter.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Kid Rock was rumored to be the next celebrity to follow Trump\u2019s path into politics. But the poll that started the buzz came from a shady corner of the internet and may not have been conducted as advertised. Harry Enten went down a rabbit hole and found that fake polls are a real problem.\n\nWhen Trump was a candidate, he often noted that the electoral system was rigged because so many noncitizens were registered to vote. But the evidence that Trump cited when making claims of voter fraud didn\u2019t show what Trump said it did. Maggie Koerth-Baker investigated how an academic paper became a keystone of the Trump administration\u2019s allegations of voter fraud.\n\nAfter about half a year of the Trump presidency, Julia Azari came to a striking realization: Trump is a 19th-century president facing 21st-century problems.\n\nThe media\u2019s coverage of the Trump administration has been filled with stories that employ anonymous sources to discuss what\u2019s happening in the White House. Not all anonymous sources are created equally, though. Perry Bacon Jr. put together a guide for when to trust a story that uses anonymous sources and which anonymous sources are worth paying attention to.\n\nAs the Democrats seek to take back Congress in 2018, David Wasserman wrote about their uphill climb: The congressional map is historically biased toward the GOP.\n\nTrump\u2019s rise to power inspired a huge following in some corners of the internet. In March, we profiled one of the president\u2019s most rabid fan clubs: a subreddit called \u201cThe_Donald.\u201d\n\nAs the Supreme Court deliberates partisan gerrymandering, Galen Druke has been profiling the problems with redistricting reform efforts: Partisanship always finds a way back in.\n\nTrump\u2019s contentious back and forth with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong Un, was a defining story of the summer. As the heads of state traded threats, Oliver Roeder wrote about how game theory can be used to win a nuclear standoff.\n\nAs stories about sexual assault and harassment inundated the fall, Clare Malone noted that nearly all of them were about people in white-collar industries. That prompted her to investigate whether the #MeToo moment will reach women in low-wage jobs.\n\nAnna Maria Barry-Jester spent much of the year covering the Republicans\u2019 efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act. But she also looked beyond Obamacare. In April, she wrote about how patterns of death in the South still show the outlines of slavery, and in June, she wrote that the health care system is leaving the southern Black Belt behind. In conjunction with those stories, Ella Koeze created an interactive map that shows 35 years of American death data.\n\nAfter the mass shooting in Las Vegas, there was some debate over whether stronger gun laws lead to less gun violence. But just looking at correlations between gun laws and violence isn\u2019t enough, Jeff Asher and Mai Nguyen wrote, because guns can cross state lines even when gun laws don\u2019t.\n\nWhen the FBI released its first crime report under Trump, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher noticed something: It was missing a ton of data, and the agency\u2019s explanations for why didn\u2019t add up. FBI Director Christopher Wray now says the data will again be released to the public.\n\nThis hurricane season was relentless for the U.S., with several major storms causing major damage. If Hurricane Sandy is any indication, the recovery from that damage is not going to be quick. Julia Wolfe and Oliver Roeder used FiveThirtyEight\u2019s longest chart ever to show that New York City is still getting calls about Sandy recovery.\n\nAfter the U.S. men\u2019s national soccer team broke our hearts with the worst loss in the history of U.S. men\u2019s soccer, we went looking for another squad to support.

As Kaepernick went unsigned in the offseason, Kyle Wagner and Neil Paine investigated whether it was Kaepernick\u2019s skills that were to blame. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nAs the 2016-17 NBA season came to a close, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s NBA team made the case for five different MVPs, including the eventual winner, Russell Westbrook.\n\nOne of the runner-ups for MVP, James Harden, has bloomed over the past few years into one of the league\u2019s best players. Chris Herring noted one of Harden\u2019s many quirks: He\u2019s great at drawing fouls behind the 3-point line.\n\nNate Silver is tired of baseball closers being used only as ninth-inning specialists. So, to help get more of a team\u2019s best relievers in the game earlier, he created a new stat: the goose egg, which tracks which relievers are the best at putting out fires when the stakes are highest.\n\nPeople are still trying to figure out why there are so many dang home runs in baseball now. Rob Arthur continued his investigation into the home-run surge, and the evidence points to the balls being juiced.\n\nSpeaking of those home runs, midway through this MLB season, there had been 56,785 home runs hit since the start of 2006. Neil Paine and Rachael Dottle charted how far those home runs would have traveled if you put them all together (4,280 miles) and which MLB player\u2019s bombs traveled the furthest.\n\nFor years, the Bechdel Test has been used to evaluate whether a film is invested in its female characters. But the Bechdel Test is an imperfect measure of Hollywood\u2019s inequalities. So Walt Hickey, Ella Koeze, Rachael Dottle and Gus Wezerek canvassed Hollywood in search of a new one and watched 2016\u2019s 50 top-grossing movies to see how they stacked up.\n\nIs your Dungeons & Dragons character rare?

(It\u2019s harder than it looks.)\n\nIn February and March, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s science team explored Mars. As part of that series, Christine Laskowski and Maggie Koerth-Baker noted why sex is one of space\u2019s final frontiers.\n\nWhen Maggie Koerth-Baker wasn\u2019t writing about space sex, she was writing about panda sex. In November, she wrote about Pan Pan, the panda who was so good at sex that he helped save his species.\n\nThe Trump administration has reshaped the nation\u2019s science agenda, and Republicans are often demanding that researchers provide \u201csound science\u201d to substantiate their claims. Christie Aschwanden wrote about that term and why the easiest way to dismiss good science is to demand sound science.\n\nDan Engber went to rural Oregon to find the grandfather of alt-science. His name is Art Robinson, and his contrarian views about things like climate change have found their way into powerful circles in Washington.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/legal-weed-isnt-the-boon-small-businesses-thought-it-would-be/", "published": "2017-12-29T11:00:41", "title": "Legal Weed Isn\u2019t The Boon Small Businesses Thought It Would Be", "text": "The business of selling legal weed is big and getting bigger. North Americans spent $6.7 billion on legal cannabis last year, and some analysts think that with California set to open recreational dispensaries on Jan. 1 and Massachusetts and Canada soon to follow, the market could expand to more than $20.2 billion by 2021. So it\u2019s no surprise that you see eager business people across the country lining up to invest millions of dollars in this green rush.\n\nBut here\u2019s a word of warning for those looking to dive head-first into these brand-new legal weed markets: The data behind the first four years of legal pot sales, with drops in retail prices and an increase in well-funded cannabis growing operations, shows a market that increasingly favors big businesses with deep pockets. As legal weed keeps expanding, pot prices are likely to continue to decline, making the odds of running a profitable small pot farm even longer.\n\nWashington offers a cautionary tale for would-be pot producers. The state\u2019s marijuana market, for which detailed information is available to the public, has faced consistent declines in prices, production consolidated in larger farms and a competitive marketplace that has forced cannabis processors to shell out for sophisticated technology to create brand new ways to get high.\n\n\u201cA lot of people (in Washington) are surprised, and a lot of people are in denial about the price dropping,\u201d said Steven Davenport, a researcher with the RAND Corporation. \u201cThe average price per gram in Washington is about $8, and it\u2019s not clear where the floor is going to be.\u201d\n\nDavenport has watched the legal weed market from its inception, starting with his work as a consultant to regulators in Washington state in 2013 when they were writing the rules that would govern the country\u2019s second legal weed market, which allowed for both growing pot and licensing businesses to sell the product the following year.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a lot of data on how the market for cannabis worked back in 2013, and the regulators in Colorado and Washington were trying to write rules for a product that had never been sold on any regulated market. Questions about the market dynamics behind selling pot were in some ways unanswerable, the telltale information buried deep in the ledgers of black market dealers.\n\nNow, four years later, as entrepreneurs launch recreational cannabis businesses in California and Massachusetts, the tables have turned. With legal pot sales happening every day in five states, there\u2019s a wealth of data about how the market works. In fact, there might be more public data on how this market works than any other market in the world thanks to a public database containing each legal weed transaction that has taken place in Washington state. The massive, 45-gigabyte database tracks every plant as it is harvested, processed and sold.\n\nThis data shows that legalization has been extremely disruptive to the previous ways of growing and processing pot, when small, underground weed businesses could stay afloat with a basement full of grow lights.\n\n\u201cPrices are declining, the industry is consolidating, product variety is exploding \u2014 and none of that is a surprise,\u201d said Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a former co-director of RAND\u2019s Drug Policy Research Center who co-authored a book in 2012 called \u201cMarijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know.\u201d \u201cThose are all things that we predicted well in advance because they are natural consequences of legalizing along a for-profit commercial model.\u201d\n\nDeclining Pot Prices\n\nPot shoppers didn\u2019t have much of an economic incentive to purchase legal weed when Washington\u2019s first recreational stores opened in July 2014. With only a handful of farms and stores licensed to sell legal pot, the market\u2019s supply was constricted, and the average retail price per legal gram in that first month of sales was $32.48, considerably higher than the black market or medical market prices.\n\nThe average retail price went up to $35.67 the following month, according to the state\u2019s data as provided by TopShelfData.com, but pot prices have seen a steady decline since then: Within six months, the average retail price had dropped to $21.07 a gram; a year later, after a change in state taxes, pot was averaging just $12.32 a gram; and by September of this year, the average retail price for a gram was $7.45, or 77 percent cheaper than when the legal market first began. Producers in September were getting an average wholesale price of $2.53 a gram of pot.\n\nThose prices are a lot lower than what the pot farmers thought they would be getting for a wholesale gram when they were first applying for licenses at the end of 2013, according to Susan Gress, a legal pot farmer on Vashon Island, just outside of Seattle.\n\n\u201cIt was just blue sky estimates, anything from $5 to $25 \u2014 nobody had any idea. We were hoping for somewhere around seven or eight (dollars a gram), and back in those days, we were able to get $8 a gram,\u201d Gress said. \u201cBut things have changed.\u201d\n\nGress, who used her retirement savings to start the Vashon Velvet pot farm in an old horse barn on her property, said she thinks her brand has a better chance of surviving because it is considered premium and she is able to charge closer to $5 for a wholesale gram. But not everyone will manage to keep going as prices go down.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly obvious why growing has gotten cheaper, Caulkins noted: On the one hand, pot farmers no longer have to spend time and energy avoiding police; on the other, industrial farming techniques and engineers are now involved in the industry, designing state-of-the-art grow facilities to increase efficiency and lower production costs. These changes \u2014 with their related price drops \u2014 are only likely to continue.\n\nCalifornia and Massachusetts are starting their own legal markets in 2018, and prices will decline even further if the federal government ends its prohibition, according to Caulkins.\n\n\u201cOnce it\u2019s nationally legalized and farmers can grow it just like tomatoes and asparagus, it will be crazy cheap to grow compared to what it was in the past, and it will be either crazy cheap or pretty darn cheap to process, depending on which kind of product you are making,\u201d Caulkins said.\n\nConsolidating Cannabis Farming\n\nWhen Washington\u2019s regulators set up their market for legal cannabis, they created three tiers of pot producers based on the square footage of each farm. License different sizes of farms, the thinking went, and the market will support a range of small, medium and large producers.\n\nFast-forward three years, and it appears this thinking was flawed. Big recreational producers have swallowed up most of the market, pushing out the small-scale growers of the black and medical markets. From January through September of this year, the 10 largest farms in Washington harvested 16.79 percent of all the dry weight weed grown in the state, which is more than the share produced by the 500 smallest farms combined (13.12 percent).\n\nDavenport said this consolidation of cannabis farming in Washington is just a harbinger of what\u2019s to come. \u201cI think what has become more clear is the inevitability of pretty large-scale production, and that is really going to start to drive down production costs,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nCurrent regulations keep pot farms from infinitely expanding, but as legalization marches forward, bigger farms could well be permitted. This summer, regulators in Washington expanded the maximum farm size from 30,000 square feet to 90,000. California plans on capping farms at 1 acre, or 43,560 square feet, when the market first launches. But the state rules do not currently stop farmers from using multiple licenses, which opens the door for larger farms.\n\nWhat would happen if pot farms could be as large as wheat or corn fields? According to Caulkins, 10 reasonably sized farms could conceivably produce the entire country\u2019s supply of tetrahydrocannabinol, pot\u2019s most famous active chemical (usually shortened to THC).\n\n\u201cYou can grow all of the THC consumed in the entire country on less than 10,000 acres,\u201d Caulkins said. \u201cA common size for a Midwest farm is 1,000 acres.\u201d\n\nThe economic pressure on small pot farmers is only likely to increase if a nationwide market for cannabis opens up and the country\u2019s largest, multibillion-dollar agriculture companies are able to invest in production \u2014 something they are blocked from doing until the federal government changes its laws.\n\n\u201cThe professionalization of the industry is an ongoing thing,\u201d Caulkins said. \u201cThere has been enormous change, but there is at least as much change still to come.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Not Your Parent\u2019s Pot\n\nWalk into a legal weed store, and you\u2019ll see shelves of products that hardly resemble the pot of Cheech & Chong. From weed mineral waters to pot topical rubs to cannabis sodas, producers use sophisticated and expensive equipment to get creative with how they deliver pot to their customers. And Washington\u2019s weed data shows that consumers have clearly developed a taste for these processed products.\n\nWhen legal weed stores first opened in Washington in July 2014, flower \u2014 the unprocessed nuggets of cannabis that can be put into pipes or joints \u2014 made up 94.80 percent of the market, but a year later, flower accounted for only 72.62 percent of sales. That share had further dropped to 54.50 percent by September of this year, the date of the most recent available data from TopShelfData.com.\n\nOther forms of pot \u2014 like concentrates, vapes and edibles \u2014 take up the rest of the market. Concentrates, highly potent products that can be consumed in a variety of ways, made up just 5.2 percent of all sales in July 2014 but accounted for 17.96 percent in September of this year. Vape cartridges, which allow cannabis to be consumed through electronic cigarettes, accounted for 7.67 percent in September, while edibles made up 8.46 percent of sales.\n\nCaulkins said this kind of diversification is only natural in an industry where the basic product \u2014 loose-leaf flower \u2014 is relatively cheap to produce. \u201cIf you take the same amount of marijuana and put it into an edible, then your edible might taste different than a competitor\u2019s and so be differentiated by its other ingredients,\u201d Caulkins said. \u201cThey are trying everything they can to differentiate their product so they can command a price premium.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s relatively cheap to grow and sell unprocessed pot, it can take a massive investment in equipment to produce the edibles and concentrates that are becoming increasingly popular. Products like flavorless pot mineral water or concentrates so pure they form crystals are made with a combination of pharmaceutical and food science technology and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment to produce. For small-business owners, it can be difficult, or impossible, to buy the equipment it takes to produce modern pot edibles themselves.\n\nThis business climate appears to limit the number of companies willing to produce edibles. Of the more than 1,000 Washington companies with active licenses that would allow them to process edibles in the 12 months prior to September 2017, only 74 companies sold an edible, according to TopShelfData.com. And, just like with flower, a few large companies dominated the edible market. The five largest edible producers were responsible for 51.15 percent of the $38.7 million in edibles sold during those 12 months. The top 20 edible producers accounted for 90.48 percent of edibles during that time period.\n\nAs legal weed expands across the continent, that drive to find a way to charge a premium for pot won\u2019t end anytime soon. Combined with dropping pot prices and consolidating production, it isn\u2019t likely to get any easier for small-business owners to find a profitable way to sell legal weed.", "author": ["Lester Black"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "http://nbpostgazette.com/2018/03/23/growing-opportunity-for-startups-in-the-fuel-dispensers-industry/", "published": "2018-03-23T17:09:25", "title": "Growing opportunity for startups in the Fuel Dispensers industry", "text": "Questale released a detailed assessment of trends in Fuel Dispensers market.

Paraffin deposition leads to loss in oil production and transportation problems by accumulating in tubing, producing formation face, flow-lines and valves. Various chemical-, mechanical- and thermal-based methods are available in order to combat the formation and removal of paraffin deposits economically.\n\nParaffin control chemicals are basically complex formulations of different chemicals. Crude oil contains varying degree of long chain waxes or paraffin that tend to form deposits when the oil is subjected to changes in pressure, temperature or other conditions. Various paraffin control chemicals such as dispersants/detergents are utilized to remove the deposits that are already formed and inhibits to interfere with wax crystal formation and growth.\n\nMore than 80% of the world\u2019s oil is prone to precipitated paraffin deposits, which over the time can reduce the oil flow to such an extent that production ceases altogether. Paraffin build up drastically reduces the efficiency of entire oil recovery and transfer systems. Further, utilization of paraffin control chemicals possess various advantages, which include reduction in crude oil viscosity, reduction in solids backup, maintained fluid flow through the pipeline, mitigation of lost production and energy saving, etc.\n\nGrowing investments in the oil & gas industry is supporting the demand for the paraffin control chemicals. Oil & gas producers in the Middle East & Africa have been continuously spending on oil, petrochemical and gas production in order to meet the capacity expansion targets. Despite the lower crude oil prices, manufacturers in the region are continuously spending heavily on oil infrastructure to maintain the capacity. As per the MEED, the Saudi Arabia Co. plans to invest US$ 334 Bn on its oil and gas value chain by 2025 end. Thus, in turn, is expected to boost the demand for the paraffin control chemicals and driving the growth of the global paraffin control chemicals market over the forecast period.\n\nUtilization of paraffin control chemicals is primarily dependent upon the operating conditions of the oilfield.
