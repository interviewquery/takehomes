    "Commerce is an age-old industry that has seen a lot of disruption over\n",
    "the past couple of decades. From Amazon and eBay to more recent examples\n",
    "like Stitch Fix and Dollar Shave Club, many companies have leveraged the\n",
    "internet to create successful e-commerce businesses.\n",

    "We hypothesize that these e-commerce \"winners\" exhibit similar patterns\n",
    "or characteristics. If we can identify these patterns, we may be able to\n",
    "use them to pick out future winners as well. To test this hypothesis, we\n",
    "have collected sales data for several recent successful e-commerce\n",
    "companies in `sales.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, cohort-level data for several e-commerce companies are contained in the files:\n",
