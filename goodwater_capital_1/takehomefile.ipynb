    "We hypothesize that these e-commerce \"winners\" exhibit similar patterns\n",
    "or characteristics. If we can identify these patterns, we may be able to\n",
    "use them to pick out future winners as well. To test this hypothesis, we\n",
    "have collected sales data for several recent successful e-commerce\n",
    "companies in `sales.csv`. \n",
