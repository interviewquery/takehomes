    "# Description\n",
    "This is a pre-interview task for the position of **data scientist**\n",
    "at BusinessOptics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to fit a statistical model to historical credit\n",
    "data and then use the model to estimate the value of current loans. The\n",
    "task is broken up into five steps which are explained in detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a relatively straightforward task and should not take you too\n",
    "long to complete. We would like you to complete the task using a python\n",
    "notebook and a number of commonly-used data science libraries. We would\n",
    "like you to demonstrate that you have some familiarity with some core\n",
    "concepts in data science and that you either are familiar enough with\n",
    "the particular technologies or can use online resources to become\n",
    "familiar enough to solve the task. Within these parameters there are\n",
    "still many ways to solve the task. If necessary you can make (and note)\n",
    "assumptions about the data and the interpretation of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment Steps \n",
    "The first step sets up the environment that we would like you to use to\n",
    "solve the task. The remaining steps take you through the process of\n",
    "building, evaluating and using the model to solve the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*[Note from IQ staff: this section originally included a step about install anaconda. \n",
    "Since we provide our takehomes in Google Colab, we excluded this step.\n",

    "-   `gender` - The gender of the account holder - either `\"M\"` or `\"F\"``\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `age` - The age of the account holder at the point of application\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `income` - The monthly net income of the account holder at the point\n",

    "-   `installment_amount` - The monthly installment amount\n",

    "-   `credit_score_at_application` -The credit score at the point of\n",
    "    application, this is a positive integer less than 1000. The higher\n",
    "    the score the more creditworthy the applicant is believed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `outstanding_balance` - The remaining amount of the loan that still\n",
    "    has to be repaid\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `status` - This indicates what state the account is in. This field can\n",
    "    take one of three values\n",
    "    - `\"LIVE\"`: The loan is still being repaid - the field `outstanding_balance` will be greater than zero.\n",
    "    -   `\"PAID_UP\"`: The loan has been completely repaid - the field\n",
    "        `outstanding_balance` will be zero.\n",
    "    -   `\"DEFAULT\"`: The loan was not fully repaid and no further payments can\n",
    "        be expected - the field `outstanding_balance` will be greater than\n",
    "        zero and the amount will not be recoverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a sense of the distribution of the fields and the\n",
    "relationships between the fields make some plots using the pandas\n",
    "dataframe `plot` function - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html\n",

    "relationship between variables. Don't spend too long on these plots,\n",
    "they needn't be beautiful nor do they need to be exhaustive. The idea is\n",

    "using your own method.\n",

    "***Important note***: You ***MUST NOT*** use the `outstanding_balance` field as\n",

    "\n",
    "Choose a suitable evaluation metric from scikit-learn's `metrics` package .\n",
    "Use your fitted model to predict the probabilities of default for the\n",

    "metric based on the actual test set outcomes and the predicted test set\n",
    "outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Use model to forecast value of book\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, use your fitted model to predict the probability of default for\n",
    "each of the loans in the current dataset. Use this probability to\n",
    "calculate the expected repayment amount for each loan (this is just one minus the predicted probability of default multiplied\n",
