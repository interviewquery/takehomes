    "2. A signup is defined as an event labeled `sign_up_success` within the `events` table. For each city ('Qarth' and 'Meereen') and each day of the week, determine the percentage of signups in the first week of 2016 that resulted in completed a trip within 168 hours of the sign up date.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Driver Experience team has just finished ![redesigning the Uber Partner app] (https://newsroom.uber.com/new-partner-app/). The new version expands the purpose of the app beyond just driving. It includes additional information on earnings, ratings, and provides a unified platform for Uber to communicate with its partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Propose and define the primary success metric of the redesigned app. What are 2-3 additional tracking metrics that will be important to monitor in addition to the success metric defined above?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outline a testing plan to evaluate if redesigned app performs better (according to the metrics you outlined). How would you balance the need to deliver quick results, with statistical rigor, and while still monitoring for risks?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain how you would translate the results from the testing plan into a decision on whether to launch the new design or roll it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3 - Data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber's Driver team is interested in predicting which driver signups are most likely to start driving. To help explore this question, we have provided a sample  dataset of a cohort of driver signups in January 2015.The data was pulled a few months after they signed up to include the result of whether they actually completed their first trip. It also includes several pieces of background information gather about the driver and their car.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like you to use this data set to help understand what factors are best at predicting whether a signup will start to drive, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Uber.\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for a detailed description of the dataset. Please include any code you wrote for the analysis and delete the dataset when you have finished with the challenge. Please also call out any data related assumptions or issues that you encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the provided data for this analysis (a few sentences/plots describing your approach will suffice). What fraction of the driver signups took a first trip? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build a predictive model to help Uber determine whether or not a driver signup will start driving. Discuss why you chose your approach, what alternatives you considered, and any concerns you have. How valid is your model? Include any key indicators of model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Briefly discuss how Uber might leverage the insights gained from the model to generate more first trips (again, a few ideas/sentences will suffice).\n",
