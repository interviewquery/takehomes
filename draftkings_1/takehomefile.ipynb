    "# Draftkings Data Analyst Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is core to the success of Draftkings and its brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is broken into three parts. The first requires a written answer, the second requires applied SQL knowledge, and the third requires applied programming knowledge and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subject to interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting, interpreting, and being confident in your source data is key to providing value with data analysis.\n",

    "You have been asked to get some answers from a database on a set of data. The database contains an archive of bids made by users for players over the years. The database contains years of data, and you will need to write raw SQL queries to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the table structure below, provide the SQL queries required to answer as many of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the total number of users who have placed a bid on **Wayne Rooney** whilst playing for **Manchester United**?\n",
    "- What is the total number of bids for **Cristiano Ronaldo** placed by users in Spain?\n",
    "- What is the total number of users who have never placed a bid?\n",
    "- What is the % of bids for each player\n",
    "- What is the % of bids for each team\n",
    "- Rank teams in order of the # of bids their players have had.\n",
