    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use your machine learning experience to solve\n",
    "a straightforward but challenging prediction​ ​problem.​ ​The​ ​exercise​\n",
    "​contains two​​ parts​\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building​ ​a​ ​machine​ ​learning​ model​ ​ ​for​ ​a​ ​prediction ​ task​ \n",
    "2. Writing ​ an​ ​ application​ ​ to​ ​ make​ ​ ​predictions ​ using​ ​ ​that​ ​model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1, we would love to have you exhibit your modeling skills. You\n",
    "will be evaluated on the following - performance on the test set,\n",
    "feature engineering choices including features used and encoding of\n",
    "features, data processing, choice of models used, description of model\n",
    "performance and insights and observations from the​ ​model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 is your chance to show off your software engineering skills. This\n",
    "includes performance of the application, adherence to common software\n",
    "engineering patterns (unit tests, modular code, etc.) and ability to\n",
    "make educated​ ​trade-offs​ ​based​ ​on​ ​the​ ​given ​ constraints.​\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For​ this part, you must use a production ready language like\n",
    "Python. Thus, please do not use R.\n",

    "# Problem ​Description \n",
    "\n",
    "When​ a​ ​consumer​ ​places​ ​an​ ​order​ ​on​ DoorDash,​​ we​ ​ show​ ​ the​ ​ ​expected ​\n",
    "​time of​​ ​delivery.​ ​It​ ​is​ ​very ​important​ ​for​ DoorDash to get this right, as it has a big impact on consumer experience. In this exercise, you will build a model to predict the\n",
    "estimated time taken for a delivery and write an application that can\n",
    "make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, for a given delivery you must predict the ​**total delivery\n",
    "duration seconds** , i.e., the time taken from\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start:​ ​the​ ​time​ ​consumer​ ​submits​ ​the​ ​order ​ (​`created_at`) ​ to​\n",
    "- End:​ ​when​ ​the​ ​order​ ​will​ ​be​ ​delivered​ to​ ​ ​the​ consumer​​\n",
    "​(`actual_delivery_time`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To​ ​help​ ​with​ ​this,​ ​we​ ​have​ ​provided\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `historical_data.csv`:​ ​table​ ​of​ ​historical​ ​deliveries\n",

    "## Part ​ 1​ \n",
    "\n",
    "-   Build a model to predict the total delivery duration seconds (as\n",
    "    defined above). Feel free to generate additional​ ​features​ ​from​ ​the ​ given​ ​ data​ ​ to​ ​ improve​ ​ model​ ​performance.​\n",
    "-   Explain a) model(s) used, b) how you evaluated your model\n",

    "-   Submit​ ​the​ ​code​ ​used​ ​for​ ​this​ ​part\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part ​ 2​ \n",
    "-   Write an application that accepts data from the json file\n",
    "    (`data_to_predict.json`), uses the model to make a prediction for each\n",
    "    delivery in the json file and writes out predictions to a new ​*tab separated file* (`tsv`) with​ ​columns​ ​-​ ​`delivery_id`, ​`predicted_delivery_seconds`\n",
