    "This project prototypes a system for monitoring crypto currency prices and sentiment of Twitter messages surrounding the coins of interest. It is meant to be a homework exercise for Data Engineers interviewing at Invitae. We hope that our candidates will ask questions and treat this exercise as a chance to collaborate with Invitae's team prior to joining.\n",

    "Use the provided data files to perform a correlation between cryptocurrency price and twitter sentiment. It should utilize the data in `historical_coin_data.txt` and `historical_sentiment_data.txt` to build the correlation.\n",
