    "Springboard would like to experiment with different payment options to\n",
    "determine which ones lead to highest student completion (and retention).\n",
    "There are two payment options under consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Upfront: ​**The student pays upfront for most or all of the course\n",
    "    in return for a discount\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Subscription:​** The student pays month-to-month for as long as\n",
    "    they take to complete the course, with an option to cancel at any\n",
    "    time\n",
    "\n",
    "Our courses typically have two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed-length:​** Students have to finish the course in a fixed\n",
    "amount of time \n",
    "2. **Self-paced:​** Students can take as long as they\n",

    "one. Here are some questions to help you guide your analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Do you have any hypotheses around why the choice of payment option\n",
    "    (upfront or subscription) should be correlated to completion rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Can you summarize and visualize the data in a compact manner,\n",
    "    preferably in as few charts as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Can you draw any conclusions around whether one option is better\n",
