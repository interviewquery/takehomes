    "Springboard would like to experiment with different payment options to\n",
    "determine which ones lead to highest student completion (and retention).\n",
    "There are two payment options under consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Upfront: ​**The student pays upfront for most or all of the course\n",
    "    in return for a discount\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Subscription:​** The student pays month-to-month for as long as\n",
    "    they take to complete the course, with an option to cancel at any\n",
    "    time\n",
    "\n",
    "Our courses typically have two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed-length:​** Students have to finish the course in a fixed\n",
    "amount of time \n",
    "2. **Self-paced:​** Students can take as long as they\n",
    "like, and pay as they go\n",

    "recommend to Springboard which payment option (if any) is the better\n",
    "one. Here are some questions to help you guide your analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Do you have any hypotheses around why the choice of payment option\n",
    "    (upfront or subscription) should be correlated to completion rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Can you summarize and visualize the data in a compact manner,\n",
    "    preferably in as few charts as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Can you draw any conclusions around whether one option is better\n",
    "    than the other? Does the course structure play a role?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  What recommendations would you make to Springboard as a business?\n",
