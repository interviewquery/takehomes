    "\n",
    "Build a set of classes that represents the fulfillment of food orders in\n",

    "# Implementation Details \n",
    "\n",
    "Create classes as you see fit, each having appropriate encapsulation,\n",
    "attributes, and well defined interfaces. All orders should be read from\n",

    "make the order (instant), then place the order on its correct shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of shelves:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A hot shelf that can store 15 hot orders\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A cold shelf that can store 15 cold orders\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A frozen shelf that can store 15 frozen orders\n",

    "When the hot, cold, or frozen shelves are full, orders can be placed on\n",
    "the overflow shelf. If all the shelves including the overflow shelf are\n",
    "full then an order should be removed and considered waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "Orders that are on a shelf decay (lose value) over time. The value can\n",
    "be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rm value = (\\rm shelf \\ life - order \\ age) - (\\rm decay \\ rate \\ast order \\ age)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Orders that have reached a value of zero are considered waste and should\n",
    "be removed from the shelves. Decay rates double for orders on the\n",
    "overflow shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Driver should be dispatched to pick up the food order from the kitchen\n",
    "in the same order in which it was received. Due to distance and traffic,\n",
    "each order should be picked up by the driver on a random time scale\n",
    "between 2 and 10 seconds after the order is placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the contents of each shelf including the normalized value\n",
    "(between 0 and 1) of each order. The display should be updated every\n",
