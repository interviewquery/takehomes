The notification stems from an incident over a period of eight days in late October when documents containing protected health information were comingled in error with other refuse and placed in commercial dumpsters for disposal. The unsecured documents may have included patient names, account numbers, birth dates, home addresses, types of treatment, insurance information, medical information, and, in a few cases, credit card information. Hospital officials say they are confident the documents went directly to a secured landfill. But out of an abundance of caution, patients are being notified and offered assistance in monitoring their financial accounts. We sincerely apologize to our patients for the breach, said Steve Underdahl, President and CEO of Northfield Hospital & Clinics. We are committed to being good stewards of protected patient information and honoring our promise of confidentiality. We very much regret that this incident occurred. We are learning from it and are emerging with more secure protocols. Patients involved will receive a letter offering them resources to guard against identity theft. An 800 number will be established for people to call with questions and for help in minimizing their exposure. The number will be published next week on the Northfield Hospital & Clinics website. Northfield Hospital & Clinics is also offering free credit monitoring for a period of twelve months. As a result of the breach Northfield Hospital & Clinics, steps are underway to further improve the security of operations and eliminate future risk. For instance, desk-side recycling containers have been removed in favor of more secure, centralized confidential waste containers. Staff is being educated on best practices for the handling confidential waste and cleaning personnel will be supervised until further notice. Underdahl said a very small subset of patients is affected by this breach, but he said an incident like this is always taken seriously. We are confident that our patients exposure is minimal, he said. But we always want to error on the side of caution and do what we can to mitigate the impact of the incident.",http://www.southernminn.com/northfield_news/article_550d4a03-738f-5c89-947d-6e46ed8b4e71.html

Andrea Brooks worked at Methodist Specialty and Transplant hospital during most of 2012.  According to court papers, obtained by 1200 WOAI news, she would steal the personal information of patients, used a work computer to log onto the Texas Workforce Commission website, make fake employer information and then choose the Debit Card option to receive benefit funds.    According to a court affidavit, she scammed the Texas Workforce Commission out of $265,494.  Brooks was caught when the TWC noticed 179 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims that came from one particular computer at the Hospital.  Further investigation found 83 fraudulent claims from Brooks home computer, 152 fraudulent claims from her Sprint cell phone and 46 fraudulent claims from a phone that she had used in Puerto Rico while on her honeymoon.  TWC Spokesman Mark Lavergne says checks for this type of fraud are a high priority for the agency.  ""Texas Workforce Commission regularly cross-matches unemployment insurance claims with databases to detect possible fraud,"" he tells 1200 WOAI news.  ""So that we can ensure that funds are available exclusively to those who meet the eligibility requirements.  The majority of the victims in this case were either patients who were organ donors or transplant recipients.  Brooks faces charges of mail fraud and aggravated identity theft.  Brooks worked as a transplant assistant at Methodist Specialty & Transplant Hospital from Jan. 16, 2012, until she was fired on Nov. 14, 2012, according to her plea deal. She also had worked there from Nov. 2, 2008, through Jan. 25, 2009, the plea deal said.

Noel Barrientos previously pled guilty to one count of possessing fifteen or more access devices (social security numbers of other people) and one count of aggravated identity theft.  According to court documents, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Barrientos residence based on suspected narcotics activity. During the search warrant, officers observed and recovered a total of 15 credit/debit cards that were located throughout the premises all in different names including names of men and women not associated with Barrientos or his residence. Three of the cards were located in Barrientos wallet.  Court documents also state that during the search warrant, law enforcement found a computer that contained a file with the names, dates of birth, and social security numbers of 8,678 unique patients. Agents determined that the list came from a doctors office located on Sunset Drive in South Miami. A former doctors office employee, Gillian Armstrong [1:14-cr-20339], had access to the patient list and sold it to Barrientos. Barrientos sold the names to other individuals who used the fraudulently obtained names to file fraudulent income tax returns. Law enforcement officers also tracked fraudulent income tax return filings to Barrientos residence.  In September, 2014, Armstrong was sentenced to 36 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release for her role in the scheme.  SOURCE: U.S. Attorneys Office, Southern District of Florida  Not surprisingly, the doctors office was not named in either the release or the public court filings, and inspection of HHSs public breach tool does not reveal any breached entity with the exact number mentioned in the press release. Inspection of the proffer in Armstrongs case, however, does provide some interesting details about the method and means of the breach:  ARMSTRONG acted as a thief in this case, stealing PII for Barrientos who then sold it to third parties. ARMSTRONG became involved in late 2010, early 2011, when she was desperate for money. At the time, ARMSTRONG was a single mother with a debilitating crack cocaine addiction. ARMSTRONG was working for a doctors office in South Miami at the time of the theft while she was living out of her car.  During that time-period, ARMSTRONG agreed to sell Barrientos PII stolen from the doctors office in exchange for money. At first, ARMSTRONG copied a few names down by hand while at work and sold them to Barrientos. ARMSTRONG was able to access the PII from the doctors office through an off-site database company (the database). At the time, a1l patient information was accessible by logging onto the database website with a user name and password. Each employee has a unique username and password.  Eventually ARMSTRONG gave Barrientos the username and password to the database account. Barrientos downloaded information in batches and sold it to others. ln turn, Barrientos paid ARMSTRONG. On or about November 18, 2011, ARMSTRONG was fired from the doctors office. ARMSTRONG stated that when she told Barrientos that she was fired, he told her that he downloaded whatever number of names he could fit on a USB drive andtold her, dont worry.  Even with that added detail, however, there is nothing in HHSs breach tool that seems to really match up. By all accounts, the massive/major download occurred in November, 2011.  If anyone can figure out which incident this might be, let me know. I suppose its possible that the breach was either reported with a different date or different number of affected, or that it was reported but hasnt yet been added to the breach tool.  Comparing a list of doctors offices on Sunset Drive in South Miami to entities on the breach tool does not reveal any matches that I can see.  The proffer in Barrientoss case adds one more detail of note: when law enforcement officers examined the Bread file on Barrientoss computer, the list of over 8,000 patients included the patients names, social security numbers, dates of birth, chart numbers, and insurance information. The patients, then, were also at risk of medical identity theft, although theres nothing in the court records that indicated any reports of that.",http://www.phiprivacy.net/fl-miami-dade-county-resident-sentenced-in-identity-theft-scheme-involving-over-8600-patients-identities/

According to its website, the company operates over 200 locations in 20 states and has 3,600 employees, but it was unclear in the notification of the breach exactly how many people may be affected.  The letter explains how an internal investigation began shortly after the company was notified on April 22, 2015, that a laptop issued to an employee was stolen from their vehicle overnight.  ""On May 5, 2015, we determined that the employee's laptop was password protected, but it was not encrypted. After conducting a thorough review, we determined that the laptop may have contained files that included your name, address, date of birth, job title, and Social Security number. Although we continue to work with law enforcement, at this time, the computer has not been located,"" U.S. HealthWorks said in its notice letter to employees.  The company did not confirm whether any personal information has been accessed or used inappropriately, but it said it will offer employees free enrollment in identity protection services for one year as a precautionary measure. U.S. HealthWorks reported efforts to ensure compliance to its laptop encryption policy going forward, including an enhancement to deployment procedures for laptops and full disk encryption.  With the number of security breaches on the rise, the importance of organizations controlling and protecting data is critical.

The statement also says the incident was reported to local law enforcement authorities, and the laptops were password protected.  An internal review reveals that not all of the files on the laptops were encrypted, including patient names, information about services provided, dates of birth and certain insurance information.  Upon further review, the statement says, unencrypted information also included Erickson health plan member names, addresses and policy numbers.  Dunne said Riderwood remains committed to its standard of privacy and has taken multiple actions to safeguard patient information. Those measures include updating systems to assure encryption of files and devices, revised security policies and procedures and additional training for employees on federal and state privacy and information security requirements.  Riderwood has always taken the privacy of its residents and patients seriously by carefully managing their health information, Dunne said.  While Dunne would not confirm whether residents locks have been changed following the string of thefts occurring in eight separate units where there was no sign of entry, he said they have increased campus surveillance, improved border fencing and security and established a plan for re-keying apartment locks and modification to onsite key management protocol.  Due to the ongoing investigation, we are unable to discuss anyone who may be considered a suspect, Dunne said. Once apprehended, we intend to prosecute those involved to the fullest extent of the law.  Dunne said he does not believe any of the stolen items have been recovered as of Tuesday morning. The HIPAA notice did mention that the motive of the crime appears to be the laptops themselves and not the information contained on them.  Montgomery County Police would not comment on the incidents but said they are working with the Prince Georges County Police in their investigation. The community is located in both jurisdictions.

Bales today.  Tariq Mahmood, 63, of Cedar Hill, Texas, was found guilty by a jury of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, seven counts of health care fraud, and seven counts of aggravated identity theft following a four day trial before U.S. District Judge Michael Schneider.  According to information presented in court, Mahmood, a general practitioner, owned and operated several hospitals in the state of Texas, including Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline, Renaissance Terrell Hospital in Terrell, Central Texas Hospital in Cameron, Community General Hospital in Dilley, and Lake Whitney Medical Center in Whitney. From January 2010 to April 2013, Mahmood and others carried out a scheme to defraud Medicare and Medicaid through the submission of false and fraudulent claims. Mahmood and others added, changed, deleted, and incorrectly sequenced diagnostic codes in a way that did not reflect the actual diagnoses and conditions of the patients. They submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid based on the added, changed, deleted, and incorrectly sequenced diagnostic codes. Mahmood and others also unlawfully used Medicare beneficiaries names and Medicare numbers in order to commit health care fraud. Mahmood was indicted by a federal grand jury on April 11, 2013.  Mahmood faces up to 10 years in federal prison for the conspiracy conviction, 10 years for each health care fraud conviction and two years for each aggravated identity theft conviction. A sentencing date has not been set.  The case was investigated by the Texas Office of the Attorney General  Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (OAG-MFCU), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathaniel C. Kummerfeld and Frank Coan and Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alma Hernandez and Ken McGurk.  Any individuals with knowledge of these or other health care fraud violations are encouraged to contact the Department of Health and Human Services fraud hotline at 1-800-HHS-TIPS (447-8477)  ",http://www.ketknbc.com/news/crimewatch/etx-hospital-owner-convicted-of-health-care-fraud

""These documents for these records were complete with patients names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, court documents, treatment documents, all dumped in my dumpster illegally,"" said Dr. Scott Cold, DDS.  His contractor found the documents Friday morning in a dumpster being used for construction waste.  It appears the records come from Positive Adjustments, an out-of-business drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic. The clinic was in a building at 4548 South Atherton, adjacent to the dumpster. According to other tenants in the building, the clinic has been empty for at least six months.  Jayden Jensen was a patient at Positive Adjustments when it closed, and she said she was shocked to learn about the records in the dumpster.  ""I'm so bewildered I can't even fathom exactly how to think about it other than I'm angered and scared for my future potentially having my information out there like that,"" she said.  Jensen said she trusted the drug and alcohol rehab center during a dark time in her life, and that trust was literally thrown out with the trash.  ""I had to write things about my depression, things that, you know, are embarrassing to some, me I'm kind of out in the open anyway, but, still: That could be taken into the wrong hands and that scares me to death,"" Jensen said. ""You see shady people dumpster diving. You see people going in those dumpsters, that's exactly what they are looking for. They are trying to start their new life, lets just take it and use it to our advantage in some creepy, shady, way.""  Dr. Cold called Unified Police after discovering the records, and, after a brief investigation, police determined a criminal charge beyond illegal dumping would be hard to pursue. Police called the Utah State Department of Occupational and Professional Licensing.  The state would neither confirm nor deny if an investigation is ongoing, but state workers were in Taylorsville Friday to pick up and move all the documents back inside the building that once housed Positive Adjustments.  Jensen believes more needs to be done. She also has a 7-month-old daughter and a husband she is trying to protect.  ""Maybe have somebody go in that is state regulated to obtain such information and get rid of it in the proper way it should be handled,""Jensen said. ""That is everybody's information. That is private. That is very personal, and pretty much intricate windows into their lives.""  Federal guidelines generally require healthcare providers to keep records for six years. At that point they can be shredded, burned or otherwise destroyed. The records are destroyed in such ways to prevent the information from being used for identity theft or other crimes and to protect patient privacy.",http://fox13now.com/2015/08/07/medical-documents-filled-with-personal-info-found-filling-dumpster-in-taylorsville/; http://www.hipaajournal.com/positive-adjustments-illegal-dumping-of-medical-records-8063/

The College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alberta announced this week that it had found Deanne Dee Gayle Watrich, an emergency room doctor and a St. Albert resident, to be guilty of unprofessional conduct. Watrich had previously admitted to unprofessional conduct at a hearing tribunal held by the college last November. Specifically, the tribunal wrote in its ruling, Watrich accessed the electronic health records of three people 21 times between Aug. 5, 2009, and May 2, 2010, without having a patient/physician relationship with those people. Its okay for doctors to access patient records if they are actually treating those patients, explained college spokesperson Kelly Eby, but not otherwise. She accessed the electronic health records of three people who she was not treating, she said. Its an invasion of privacy. It also violates the provincial Health Professions Act and Health Information Act, and goes against the Canadian Medical Associations Code of Ethics and the colleges standards of practice. Watrichs case started when the provincial privacy commission began investigating a complaint from a man who had requested an Alberta Netcare log. The log showed that nine doctors, none of whom were treating him, had accessed his electronic health records. He alleged that Watrich might be the one responsible. The man listed his partner and mother as co-complainants, both of whom had their files accessed by three other doctors. Watrich admitted to the privacy commissioner and to the tribunal that she was responsible for accessing these restricted records using the logins of 12 other doctors. On 21 occasions, the tribunal heard, Watrich used computers in the emergency department of the Edmonton Misericordia Hospital to access these records after the previous user had not logged out, and did so knowing that her personal ID would not show up in the computers logs as a result. Watrich was in a personal relationship with one of the complainants when she accessed some of the records, the tribunal found, and in a relationship with the former spouse of said complainant when she accessed others. I dont know why I logged in to their Netcare and why I did it so many times, Watrich said at the hearing last November. It didnt actually give me any power. It didn't give me anything. In retrospect, she believed accessing these records might have been a way for her to cope with the difficult divorce and child-custody proceedings her partner was going through at the time.

Mark Atkins said he and other residents of Lowen Bre near Royal Cornwall Hospital at Treliske had been fed up with vehicles being parked in their street.  But when he looked closer at the blue Rover 200 car parked near his home he noticed paperwork marked with 'Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust' (RCHT) visible on the back seat.  On closer inspection he realised they were marked ""trauma list"" and included patients' names, dates of birth and details of treatment they had received.  He said: ""I was absolutely disgusted  how could someone have such complete disregard for people's privacy and leave these notes on public display in a parked car?  ""If that was my information I would be horrified that anyone could come along and read what conditions or injuries I have and how they were treated.  ""It is a blatant breach of data protection laws.""  Mr Atkins said the car also had several notes in its footwell which had been left on the vehicle by residents in the street asking the owner not to park there.  He said: ""We get people parking here all the time and we get a bit fed up of it.  ""This car appeared last Tuesday and has been there ever since.""  Mr Atkins said he had attempted to contact the hospital to alert it that patients' records were on display but received no response.  RCHT said it would follow up the report as a matter of urgency.  In a statement the trust said: ""We take the security of patient records extremely seriously and are investigating this matter.

A medical privacy breach led to the public posting on a commercial Web site of data for 20,000 emergency room patients at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., including names and diagnosis codes, the hospital has confirmed. The information stayed online for nearly a year.  The breach was discovered by a patient and reported to the hospital on Aug. 22, according to a letter written four days later to affected patients by Diane Meyer, Stanford Hospitals chief privacy officer. The hospital took aggressive steps, and the Web site removed the post the next day, Ms. Meyer wrote. It also notified state and federal agencies, Mr. Migdol said.  It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public, he said. It is our intent 100 percent of the time to keep this information confidential and private, and we work hard every day to ensure that.  Diane Dobson, of Santa Clara, Calif., said her jaw dropped on Saturday when she intercepted the letter from Ms. Meyer addressed to her 21-year-old son, who she said had received emergency psychiatric treatment at Stanford in 2009. Ms. Dobson said it could have been disastrous if her son, who lives at home, had learned that his name was linked to a mental health diagnosis.  My son, I can tell you, is fragile and confused enough that this would have sent him over the edge, Ms. Dobson said, saying she decided to speak publicly now because of her frustration with the breach. Everyone with an electronic medical record is at risk, and that means everyone.  Records compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that personal medical data for more than 11 million people have been improperly exposed during the past two years alone.  Since passage of the federal stimulus package, which includes provisions requiring prompt public reporting of breaches, the government has received notice of 306 cases from September 2009 to June 2011 that affected at least 500 people apiece. A recent report to Congress tallied 30,000 smaller breaches from September 2009 to December 2010, affecting more than 72,000 people.  The major breaches  a disconcerting log of stolen laptops, hacked networks, unencrypted records, misdirected mailings, missing files and wayward e-mails  took place in 44 states.  One occurred at the Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital at Stanford in January 2010, when a desktop computer holding the medical records of 532 patients was stolen from the heart center by an employee. Hospital officials said at the time that no patient information was compromised.  But the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $250,000, the maximum allowed, for failing to report the breach within five days of discovery, as is required under state law. The hospital appealed the fine, and a settlement has been reached but not yet disclosed, a department spokesman said.  The Stanford episode reinforces the fear that even the most prestigious medical centers are not immune to risk.",http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/us/09breach.html?_r=0

He was also convicted of using the identity of another dentist to fraudulently bill an insurance company of more than $160,000 in claims.  Neil H. MacBride, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Timothy A. Gallagher, Special Agent in Charge of the Criminal Division at the FBIs Washington Field Office, made the announcement after the verdict was accepted by United States District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.  This was an abuse of power, drugs, and women, said U.S. Attorney MacBride. Dr. Makaritas arrogance led him to believe that he could illegally distribute highly addictive drugs to others and get away with it. This is just one of hundreds of cases we have brought in Operation Cotton Candy to crack down on those abusing prescription pain medicines.  Dr. Makarita abused his power by writing unnecessary prescriptions that had no medical need and then submitting fraudulent claims for reimbursement, said FBI SAC Gallagher. Health care fraud is a growing threat that harms not only those illegally prescribed powerful drugs but companies and consumers that pay for the fraud. The results of Operation Cotton Candy demonstrate the commitment that the FBI has in uncovering this type of fraud and bring perpetrators to justice.  Makarita was convicted of conspiracy, health care fraud, aggravated identity theft, and five counts of dispensing controlled substances. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on the health care fraud charge, 20 years in prison for conspiracy and each dispensing controlled substances charge, and a consecutive two-year sentence for the aggravated identity theft charge. Sentencing has been scheduled for February 15, 2013.  According to court records and evidence at trial, Makarita owns and operates a dental practice in Oakton, Virginia, and advertised online at www.fixasmile.com. From about 2007 to 2012, Makarita illegally distributed and dispensed prescription medicine (Fentanyl, Vicodin, and Valium) to patients, employees, and at least one girlfriend, all without a legitimate dental purpose and beyond the bounds of a dental practice. Makarita directed those who received the prescriptions he issued to return to him some or all the prescribed medicine. On multiple occasions, Makarita would distribute prescription pills to patients and at least one girlfriend in social settings and for prurient and sexual purposes. On one occasion, the defendant took explicit photographs of an unconscious girlfriend who was under the influence of alcohol and Vicodin.  In addition, the jury found that Makarita provided more than $160,000 in services to his family members and billed them to an insurance provider in violation of the providers contract. He billed the services under the name of another dentist who did not practice in Makaritas office at that time. Makarita received more than $91,000 in reimbursement from the provider for these fraudulent claims.  The investigation was conducted by the FBIs Washington Field Office. Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mazen M. Basrawi and Danya E. Atiyeh and Assistant U.S. Attorney Gene Rossi are prosecuting the case on behalf of the United States.  This case is part of an Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) investigation (Operation Cotton Candy), which has been focusing on the illegal distribution by numerous doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and patients of pain medication. This OCDETF matter has secured more than 200 drug-trafficking convictions and guilty pleas.

The investigation stems from when a financial services employee of the hospital accessed the detailed billing records of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease and shared them with someone who deliberately and maliciously published those records on Facebook, taunting and ridiculing the patient.  The investigation began last week after Healthcare IT News contacted HHS to ask about the incident. HHS spokesperson Rachel Seeger also said that the incident -- which resulted in the hospital firing the employee shortly after the hospital learned of the incident and an imminent lawsuit -- should have been reported to the HHS Office for Civil Rights before March 1, 2014. Late last week, Seeger said, ""This is the first that we have heard of that incident.""  The hospital's response? The University of Cincinnati Medical Center had indeed reported the incident to the government long before the March 1, 2014, deadline and has the proof that it filed, according to hospital spokesperson Diana Maria Lara. ""We have confirmation we notified the Secretary of HHS via their website portal on October 3rd, 2013 at 12:57 PM,"" Lara said, adding, ""I cannot show you a copy as it would violate HIPAA. We have confirmation it was received by HHS.""  As for the federal investigation, Lara said, ""We have not received any notification from HHS regarding any investigation.""  When HHS spokesperson Seeger was asked about the specifics of the investigation and whether the hospital had been notified, she replied via email saying: the HHS Office for Civil Rights ""cannot comment on open investigations. I regret that I cannot offer further details.""  At this early stage, an investigation's launch may mean little. When a news report or lawsuit speaks of activities that would seem to violate HIPAA rules, HHS would have little choice but to launch an investigation to determine if a fine was merited, either for the incident or for the failure to report (which the hospital disputes) or both.  What made the original incident so problematic is that it seemed to be a clear case of someone using HIPAA-protected data deliberately and maliciously to humiliate and otherwise attack a patient. The argument in the hospital's favor is that posting of data on Facebook was not done by the employee, but by someone with a direct relationship to the patient (father of her then unborn child). Could that hospital employee have thought it was OK to share such information with the baby's father?  This calls into question the hospital's policies and procedures and whether a financial employee should have been able to access intimate medical details, especially when there was no business to have even accessed that patient's account. From an IT perspective, it asks what access restrictions are realistic and reasonable. How much can/should a hospital restrict access? Would such restrictions hurt employee efficiency in trying to clean up billing problems?",http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/feds-investigate-embarrassing-hipaa-breach-in-cincinnati/279023/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Healthcare+Dive+created+2014-06-25+105610412219&utm_content=Healthcare+Dive+created+2014-06-25+105610412219+CID_395de659269e923e22ccd0040987a9d0&utm_source=campaignmonitor&utm_term=Feds%20investigate%20embarrassing%20HIPAA%20breach%20in%20Cincinnati; http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/feds-investigate-embarrassing-hipaa-breach-in-cincinnati/279023/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Healthcare+Dive+created+2014-06-25+105610412219&utm_content=Healthcare+Dive+created+2014-06-25+105610412219+CID_395de659269e923e22ccd0040987a9d0&utm_source=campaignmonitor&utm_term=Feds%20investigate%20embarrassing%20HIPAA%20breach%20in%20Cincinnati

The information accessed was limited to patient names, hospital admission dates and flowsheets. This employee was authorized to access limited portions of patient records, but contrary to extensive training and specific instructions, unnecessarily viewed other records.”  Giddens said the employee was identified and placed on leave from work and terminated from employment.  “During the subsequent investigation of this unauthorized patient records access, ACH gained reasonable assurances that the information viewed by the employee was not distributed outside of ACH, nor was it misused or further disclosed in any form including verbally, electronically or in printed documents,” she said. “ACH believes the risk for fraudulent activity from this occurrence to be very low. However, all affected patients have been notified by mail and instructed they should monitor their personal financial activity as an added safeguard. ACH understands and respects a patient’s right to privacy and confidentiality.

Regrettably, this notice concerns an incident involving some of that information.  On December 26, 2014, Childrens National learned that certain employee email accounts had been potentially exposed in a way that may have allowed hackers to access information contained in those email accounts. This was a result of employees having received phishing emails and responding believing they were legitimate. This may have created an opportunity for unauthorized access to these individual email accounts from July 26, 2014 to December 26, 2014.  When we learned of this, we secured the affected email accounts and began an investigation into the phishing attack on our organization, including hiring an outside expert forensics firm. Through a comprehensive review of the affected email accounts, we determined that the information contained in the emails may have included patient demographic information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, and telephone numbers, and may have also included clinical information such as diagnoses, treatment received, medical record numbers, medical service codes or health insurance information. In a small number of instances, Social Security numbers were included. We reported the phishing attack to federal law enforcement and continue to work with them in their investigation.  Importantly, neither patient charts nor our electronic medical records system were compromised. Only the discrete information contained in the email accounts was potentially affected.  We have no evidence that this information in the emails has been misused or even accessed. However, in an abundance of caution, we began sending letters to affected patients on February 24, 2015, and have established a dedicated call center to answer questions patients may have. If you believe you are affected but do not receive a letter by March 15, 2015, please call 1-800-768-5812, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time.  We recommend that affected patients regularly review the explanation of benefits statement that they receive from their health insurer. If you identify services listed on your explanation of benefits that you did not receive, please immediately contact your insurer.  We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause you. To help ensure that a similar issue does not happen in the future, Childrens National has re-enforced the educational training our staff receive regarding phishing or suspicious emails. We have also implemented enhancements to our existing technical safeguards and initiated a review of our systems to further protect patient information.",http://childrensnational.org/notice; http://www.databreaches.net/childrens-national-health-system-notified-18000-patients-after-employees-fell-for-phishing-scheme/; http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/2015/07/childrens-national-medical-center-faces-suit-for.html

He had been accused of inappropriately accessing 760,000 electronic health records and then stealing and selling information about 12,000 motor vehicle accident patients to a co-conspirator, who used the data to solicit legal and chiropractic business.  In addition to the prison time, Munroe, who pleaded guilty on Oct. 22, 2012, to one count each of conspiracy and wrongful disclosure of identifiable health information, was also sentenced to serve a two-year term of supervised release. He had faced a potential maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison.  Two co-conspirators in the case, who also pleaded guilty, await sentencing.  Authorities alleged that from 2009 until his termination from the hospital in July 2011, Munroe used a computer at Florida Hospital Celebration to access emergency department records from multiple Florida Hospital locations. Florida Hospital is a delivery system with 22 sites in the state (see: Selling Records for Profit Alleged).  Security experts say healthcare organizations can take several steps to help minimize the risk of identity theft. Those include auditing and monitoring worker activity, restricting staff access to patient information and ramping up employee training (see: Preventing Insider Medical ID Theft).  Co-Conspirators The FBI, in a statement about the ID theft case said Sergei Kusyakov, who was involved with the operation of two Florida chiropractic centers, used the stolen information with other co-conspirators to solicit patients for legal and chiropractic services.  Kusyakov on Jan. 7 pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and four counts of wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information. He faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in federal prison. His sentencing hearing is March 25.  Meanwhile, Munroe's wife Katrina, a former insurance worker at Florida Hospital Celebration, faces a possible five-year federal prison sentence for her part in the conspiracy. Authorities allege that about a week after Dale Munroe's termination from his job, Katrina Munroe was recruited by the conspirators to take over the role of stealing patient data and providing it to Kusyakov.  In August 2012, Katrina Munroe was fired from her position at the hospital, after becoming a suspect in the data breach incident. In December 2012, she pleaded guilty to her role in the conspiracy. Her sentencing hearing is March 11.  Florida Hospital did not respond to HealthInfoSecurity's request for comment.  Addressing Insider Threats ""Preventing these kinds of breaches takes people, processes, and technology,"" says Stephen Wu, partner at the law firm Cooke, Kobrick & Wu LLP. That includes having manpower to investigate signs of potential breaches; policies and procedures about who can access patient data; and technologies such as auditing and monitoring software that helps identify unusual user behavior, he explains.  ""If a user went from accessing a database 30 times a day to thousands of times a day, that's something that needs review,"" he says. ""A software program can set off an alert of unusual activity, but it needs to be followed up.""  David Harlow, a healthcare attorney and founder of The Harlow Group LLC consulting firm notes: ""Training and re-training of employees also is a critical ID theft deterrent. ""This highlights the rules and regulations - including consequences and penalties for inappropriate or illegal activity.""  ",http://www.govinfosecurity.com/prison-time-for-health-data-theft-a-5442

A spokesman for ELHT said: Following the allegation of breach of patient confidentiality, a full investigation was undertaken by a senior manager. The findings of the investigation confirm that there had been a breach of confidentiality at source. The trust has taken this through its disciplinary process and appropriate action was taken.  Mrs Beardsworth took the case to the Information Commissioners Office alleging the trust had also breached the Data Protection Act.

The records were released while Lee County was transporting the records to be incinerated.  This release is being issued in accordance with guidelines from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (""HIPAA"").  Impacted patients have already been notified in accordance with HIPAA. To the best of Radiology Regional Center's knowledge, these records, which date from 2005-2012, may have contained patient names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance numbers, and other medical status and assessment information as well as financial information gathered in the patient medical and financial records.  As soon as Radiology Regional Center learned of the incident, every effort was made to retrieve the records, including a foot search of the surrounding area by more than a dozen of its employees and physicians.  In an abundance of caution, a second search of the area was conducted by foot on December 21, 2015 and a third was conducted on December 22, 2015.   As a result of its numerous searches, Radiology Regional Center believes that virtually all of the records were retrieved.  While every effort was made to retrieve the lost records, Radiology Regional Center acknowledges that some records may not be retrieved and so has notified potentially affected patients of the incident and presented them with the following steps they can take as precautionary measures.  Radiology Regional Center has advised potentially impacted patients to (1) place a 90 day fraud alert on their credit file, (2) review a free copy of their credit report, and (3) review their explanation of benefits statements.  Radiology Regional Center is also offering potentially affected patients with complimentary credit monitoring services.  Radiology Regional Center is taking this matter very seriously and has conducted a thorough investigation to mitigate the circumstances resulting from this incident and to ensure an incident like this does not happen again.

The Toronto Star is reporting that patient records from Peterborough Regional Health Centre were breached from 2011 and 2012. One of the seven people accused of the breach is anti-abortion activist Dawn DeCiccio. The Star discovered that DeCiccio worked as an information clerk. DeCiccio was the only staff member who was terminated with a pro-life activist profile.  Because of the sensitive nature of patient information the hospital can not comment to if files concerning abortions were breached. According to Nancy Martin-Ronson, Peterborough hospitals chief information office, the files in question were not shared with anyone outside of the centre.  After it was revealed that 280 records were accessed without authority a lawsuit was filed seeking millions. The hospital tried to have the case thrown out of court which was denied. The hospital lost their case in Superior Court. The case is now in front of the Ontario Court of Appeal.

Dhanju unlawfully accessed the patients records while working as a sessional pharmacist at Tile House Surgery, Mount Avenue Surgery and Rockleigh Court Surgery.

""Some of this pertained to patients from other trusts and private patients.""  The information on the stick contained information about where patients lived and included diagnosis and treatments. The information about patients had been kept for an audit and also contained responses to patient complaints.  So far, 23 patients have logged a formal complaint and eight have taken legal advice and action.  The trust said the data stick was 'safely destroyed' and the data extracted from the stick is now password protected and stored on the system.  Richard Sunley, acting chief executive said: ""The stick was unencrypted. There is a disciplinary process around the loss of that data stick.  ""I unreservedly apologise to all patients whose date was on that stick.""  An investigation discovered there had 'clearly' been a breach of policy, adding the stick __ which had not been supplied by the trust __ was not 'safe'.  Vanessa Harris, director of finance, said: ""Our policies were all in place. Staff are advised how to save data using passwords.""  The stick was discovered by Mel Simpkinson, of New Moorsite, Westfield, who took it home thinking it was someone's treasured photographs.  But she was shocked to find patients' private records instead when she plugged the USB stick into her laptop computer.  Speaking at the time, Mel said: ""I am baffled someone could mislay such information like this.  ""How could this even happen?""  Yvonne Clark, from Battle, also received a letter telling her she had cancer from the hospital in May, which turned out to be a mistake and was also sent to 850 other people.  ""What the heck was it doing out of the hospital?"" she said. I couldn't believe it and only a few weeks after the cancer letter.""  The trust is now making sure staff know patient information should never be stored in any format other than a secure trust computer or drive, making sure unencrypted data sticks cannot be used on staff computers.  Alice Webster added there is now mandatory training.  However she said she could not comment on the ongoing disciplinary process.",http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/thousands-hit-by-east-sussex-healthcare-trust-data-breach-1-6990252

Festus Ighalo, 36, of Virginia Beach and Emmanuel Effiong, 35, of Dallas, Texas, are charged with conspiracy to defraud the government, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and numerous counts of aggravated identity theft.  Effiong maintains his innocence, according to his attorney, Paul Todd Sartwell. He said that the two men were roommates in Virginia Beach, but that Effiong moved to Texas about the time the alleged scheme began.   The 47-count indictment doesn’t specify where ­Ighalo and Effiong worked, but several of the victims were patients at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. All were patients of Sentara medical facilities in Virginia Beach, documents said.  According to the Virginia Department of Health Professions, both men were licensed last year as nurse’s aides. ­Ighalo’s license remains in good standing.  The scheme stretched from about September 2011 through April 2013, the indictment said. The men would take names, birth dates and Social Security numbers and give them to other people. Those accomplices, not identified in the indictment, would file false income tax returns collect refunds.","http://hamptonroads.com/2013/08/two-former-sentara-workers-charged-identity-theft; http://hamptonroads.com/2013/10/sentara-employees-took-info-3700-beach-patients, "

In a letter to affected patients, Jim Evanger, President of ASM, writes that the hard drive contained information from sleep studies conducted in 2012, including:  name date of birth referring doctor interpreting doctor medical history; and sleep study results. The breach does not include Social Security numbers, Driver's License/California Identification Card numbers or any financial account information, and ASM reports that there has been no indication that information has been used for any unlawful purpose. That said, they cautioned patients about checking explanation of benefits statements for any signs of misuse and suggested that they might want to obtain credit reports to look for unexplained medical bills. Because they do not mention medical insurance account numbers being involved in the breach, it's not clear to this blogger how medical ID theft could occur unless a criminal used the information to socially engineer the patient or a doctor to obtain the insurance number.  In response to the incident, ASM is removing and destroying all remaining external hard drives going forward.  You can read the full notification letter on the California Attorney General's web site.

Baptist Health, which owns South Miami Hospital, released this statement back on Mar. 1 (via PHIPrivacy.net):  Baptist Health says its privacy office has recently learned that a South Miami Hospital employee inappropriately accessed 834 patient records.  According to the hospital, the records, dated from June 2011 through February 2012, included patient names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.  The breach came to light during a collaborative investigation with federal law enforcement officials.  The hospital said the investigation showed that the employee disclosed information to individuals involved in filing fraudulent tax returns.  The South Miami Hospital employee has been terminated, and efforts are underway to prosecute the individual to the fullest extent possible, said the hospital. The only details previously available had been the hospital stating that the employee disclosed information to individuals involved in filing fraudulent tax returns.

Pam Howard previously worked at the Division of General Surgery of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, also serving as director of the Burn Center at Arkansas Childrens Hospital. Eben Howard was employed by the Cardiology, Cardiovascular, and Cardiothoracic Surgery Department of Arkansas Childrens Hospital, according to the Eastern District of Arkansas Western Division.  The duo reportedly began to question Arkansas Childrens Hospital about how it billed the federal government. Specifically, they claimed that certain individuals created false records that caused Arkansas Childrens Hospital and third parties to bill the federal government for patient care and procedures.  Through normal job functions, the plaintiffs collected PHI, which they maintained after they had been terminated from the hospital. The information was then given to their attorney in anticipation of the pending court case, according to the decision. From there, Arkansas Childrens claimed they had committed a HIPAA violation by acquiring PHI and then disclosing it to their counsel. However, the plaintiffs claimed that they were protected under the HIPAA whistleblower exception.    The defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their defense that the plaintiffs are not entitled to whistleblower status under the False Claims Act, the decision explained. The plaintiffs, in turn, filed a response to the motion for partial summary judgment and a second verified motion to stay the time for a response to the motion for partial summary judgment in order to take depositions and to obtain discovery sought in a separately-filed motion to compel.  Citing another court case, the decision added that the plaintiffs believed in good faith that the hospital was submitting false claims and illegally billing the government:  To constitute protected activity, an employees conduct must satisfy two conditions. (1) it must have been in furtherance of an FCA action and (2) it must be aimed at matters which are calculated, or reasonably could lead, to a viable FCA action, meaning the employee in good faith believes, and . . . a reasonable employee in the same or similar circumstances might believe, that the employer is possibly committing fraud against the government. The decision explained that there were four main reasons that the court ruled that the plaintiffs qualified under the whistleblower protection and that HIPAA violations, therefore, did not take place. First, Arkansas Childrens is a covered entity, which makes it susceptible to certain rulings. Secondly, Pam Howard and Eben Howard were hospital employees and acquired the sensitive information under their normal duties.  Third, the plaintiffs believed that Arkansas Childrens Hospital behaved unlawfully, violated professional or clinical standards, or was endangering patient safety, the court explained. And finally, the disclosure was to attorney Brian Brown and to Luther Sutter, for purposes of determining their legal options with regard to their concerns. Therefore, the plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that they qualify as whistleblowers under the HIPAA regulations.",http://healthitsecurity.com/news/no-hipaa-violation-for-employees-retaining-phi-says-court; https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arkansas/aredce/4:2013cv00310/93539/110

For 21 years, Noreen Hanney, 38, of 1653 N. Thompson Drive, worked as a house manager for Adults and Children with Learning and Developmental Disabilities, Inc. (ACLD), police said. Detectives said the position allowed Hanney the access to the personal identities and banking information of the people living at the group home, located at 77 Vanderbuilt Blvd. in Oakdale.  Between June and September of 2012, police said Hanney used the debit card information of one of the mentally disabled residents and made several monthly payments on her 2008 Toyota Highlander. She also allegedly purchased airline tickets for a personal flight to Florida and withdrew cash multiple times at ATM machines, detectives said.  Sometimes she would use the [debit] card and sometimes just the number, said Det. Sgt. Mark Pulaski of the Suffolk police identity theft unit. He said in her job capacity, Hanney had access to the debit card number and ATM pin code. She was the caregiver for the mentally challenged people in the home. Their expenses had to be supplied and accounted for if they received federal and state monies, he said.  After the victim realized that more than $3,000 had gone missing from their bank account, Pulaski said the person reached out up the chain of command at the non-profit agency. The agency subsequently notified police on Oct. 9, he said.  Juliette McKenna, the director of development and community relations for the agency, said her organization discovered the theft using internal controls, and immediately notified police after noticing the alleged theft. McKenna said Hanney had access to the personal information of residents as part of her job, because most of the residents in the group home had limited capacity to understand and manage their finances. She said the agency conducted an internal investigation, which reflected that no other misconduct has occurred.  After the police department was notified, Hanney abruptly quit her job, McKenna said. It was at that point in October 2012, that she began working at the Association for Children with Down Syndrome (ACDS) in Plainview, according to a police news release. An organization spokesman said he believed the incident had nothing to do with ACDS.  Pulaski said that during the investigation, police conducted extensive surveillance operations on this subject. The investigation yielded Hanneys arrest on Thursday at her home in Bay Shore. She was charged with first-degree identity theft and is scheduled to be arraigned Friday at First District Court in Central Islip.  Pulaski said based on the nature of Hanneys job and her access to sensitive information, detectives are asking anyone who may be a victim to call the Identity Theft Unit at 631-852-6821.

The reasons she gave were vague. She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job, that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up. So she went into the hospital's computer system, assumed the identities of physicians, and gave each patient a clear reading, an investigative report says. That allowed her to avoid the time-consuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine, her lawyer Floyd Buford told the AP.  Her actions were uncovered in April 2010 after a patient who'd received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer. As hospital staff began to investigate, it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed.

Marcella Calvano, 42, pleaded guilty Tuesday at a disciplinary hearing at the College of Nurses of Ontario in Toronto of professional misconduct and engaging in conduct that is unprofessional and dishonourable. Calvano admitted to allegations of violating the privacy of patients who sought treatment in the emergency department at the hospital in 2011 and 2012, while an employee in the hospital's surgical department. In an email response, SAH public affairs officer Rose Calabani, said the hospital would not be commenting on this issue because it is a personnel matter. According to a three-page agreed statement of facts, Calvano, who obtained her nursing diploma from Sault College in 1995, was initially employed as a casual nurse and moved into a full-time position at the hospital in 2000. She worked as a critical care float nurse in the Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Department before transferring to the surgical unit wing in the spring of 2010. Access to emergency patient records was never cut off for Calvano, as they should have been, the disciplinary hearing heard. The electronic tracker allows users to see who is in the emergency department, the client's date of birth, the primary complaint and order entries like lab work, diagnostic imaging results and all lab results.

Rauber is also accused of recording the victim's routing and bank account numbers from that check. Online purchases and payments were made exceeding $800 by utilizing that information. Rauber was arrested Wednesday and arraigned in Dansville Village Court on charges of second-degree forgery, fourth-degree grand larceny, second-degree identity theft, third-degree identity theft, and petit larceny.

Jan Remm, the assistant hospital administrator who oversees regulatory compliance, said RCRMC has mailed notification letters out to each of the affected patients. A toll-free phone line has been established so patients can contact hospital representatives with any concerns or questions. Patients may call 1-877-500-1255. Protecting sensitive patient information is a golden rule in healthcare, Remm said. We apologize for the inconvenience this incident has caused our patients. Right now, we are focused on minimizing current and future impacts. Remm said RCRMC is taking steps to minimize the risk of future incidents, by:  Encrypting sensitive patient data Using locks to secure laptops to carts Developing advanced security access in areas where sensitive patient information is stored  Remm said hospital officials know each patient name in the stolen laptop. She encouraged any patient who believes they might be impacted by the incident to contact RCRMC immediately. We have no reason to believe the computer is missing because of the patient information it contained, Remm said. But, our job is to safeguard our patients privacy and thats what we are focused on doing. RCRMC, located in Moreno Valley, was established in 1893 as Riverside Countys general hospital. The hospital and its clinics provide nearly half a million inpatient and outpatient visits annually.

The data breach affects only those individuals who viewed their laboratory results through ""My Lab Results,"" an external patient network portal offered by NoMoreClipboard, a subsidiary of Medical Informatics Engineering of Fort Wayne.  Medical Informatics reported Wednesday that the attack on its main network and its NoMoreClipboard network began May 7 and wasn't detected until May 26.  It appears at this point that only demographic information was compromised and the breach did not include medical information, laboratory results or financial records. NoMoreClipboard does not collect or store any financial or credit card information.  When the breach was discovered, NoMoreClipboard immediately launched an investigation. It engaged an independent forensic company to discover how many of the medical foundation's patients were affected and which records were breached. The FBI Cyber Squad also was notified. The investigation is ongoing, but the company told the medical foundation that it hopes to complete it by the end of the week.  Indiana and Michigan laws require businesses to inform their customers and credit reporting agencies about security breaches that have placed anyone's personal information in jeopardy. If a company fails to report a breach, the Indiana attorney general can seek up to $150,000 and the Michigan attorney general can seek up to $750,000 in penalties.  Last year, the Indiana Attorney General's Office received 395 separate data breach notifications. Of that number, 61 were of Indiana companies, 36 were of government agencies in Indiana and the rest were companies based out of state.  By mid-April of this year, the office already had received nearly 150 breach notifications. This included the Anthem attack reported in February, which the attorney general's office estimates compromised nearly 4.5 million records belonging to Indiana residents alone.  Experts say that data breaches are unlikely to go away. That's why new federal legislation is being considered, which would tighten laws governing data collection and storage and require more prompt notification of breaches.  The South Bend Medical Foundation would not provide The Tribune with any details about the cyberattack beyond what was in its news release, but said it ""takes the privacy and security of patient information very seriously, and will provide more information to our patients as additional details become known.""  The release also noted that NoMoreClipboard plans to contact affected individuals within the next few days as they are identified and will offer them free credit monitoring and identity protection services for the next 24 months.",http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/business/data-breach-impacts-south-bend-medical-foundation/article_6fe99934-a54e-5318-b14b-e833bb2adde9.html

The Lee County Sheriff's Office says Lynn Schlosser was arrested after they received a complaint about identity theft and credit card fraud in January.

Investigators obtained her client list and discovered she'd opened accounts in the names of eight patients, ranging in age from 65 to 92.  Authorities say evidence found on her home computer links her to the crimes. Detectives say Schlosser used stolen credit cards to buy iPads, DVDs and spent more than $1,400 to buy tires, brakes and a battery.  When Geraldine Robbins got a call from Firestone tires telling her that she was behind on her payment for the new tires she'd had installed on her car, she knew something was wrong.

An employee of the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region has been fired after 16 patients had their personal health information breached over the last year.  Health region CEO Cecile Hunt says the employee was not involved in the patients care and has been dismissed. The motive for the snooping remains a mystery, Hunt said.  We really could not begin to speculate on the reasons for the employee doing these things, Hunt said. We know that there was a privacy breach and we have dealt with those privacy breaches.  Another employee alerted the health region to the breach on Dec. 14, prompting an investigation.  Hunt called the probe lengthy and detailed, saying it showed that the employee had improperly accessed information through the provincial EHR Viewer, which is an electronic filing system for Saskatchewan health-care records. The improper viewings, which contravened the Health Information Protection Act of Saskatchewan, came between Jan. 10 and Dec. 9, 2014.  Citing privacy issues, Hunt said she couldnt disclose the employees length of service, job or any other information. She did, however, say that reports had been filed with theemployees professional licensing body.  Hunt was unable to comment on what, if anything, the employee did with the information that was gleaned from the records.  About 3,300 physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners have access to the system across the province. Employees must log in with a personal password and a record is kept of every file they access.  The patients who had their information looked at will be informed about the breach by letters that were mailed on Wednesday. As a result, its too soon for the health region to have heard back from anyone yet.  Hunt did have a message for them.  On behalf of the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region, I sincerely apologize to each of the affected patients, she said. Our organization and I are very serious about the protection of personal health information. Its a matter of utmost importance; its a matter of trust.  She said the health region was releasing the information publically to be as transparent as possible.  The information that was accessed included prescription and lab information.  Well be happy to answer any questions that these patients might have, she said. And they will also have an opportunity to speak to the privacy commissioner if they so wish.  Patients who are concerned about access to their information can request that it only be viewed with their authorization.    The health region has taken a number of steps, aside from the firing, that it hopes will deal with the problem.   The Office of the Saskatchewan Information and Privacy Commissioner, eHealth Saskatchewan (the agency responsible for the eHR Viewer) and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health were informed. The Office of the Saskatchewan Information and Privacy Commissioner has also received a copy of the investigation report.   The eHR Viewer program will have increased monitoring and auditing.   Employees will receive additional information on the use of electronic health records and privacy laws.   The EHR Viewer is a secure website developed to provide patient information to health-care providers regardless of where an individual seeks care.    It includes information on laboratory tests, prescriptions, diagnostic imaging, immunization and clinical documentation.  The EHR system is the melding together of a number of electronic elements that have existed in varying forms in the last several years. The province announced last week that the final major piece of the puzzle, diagnostic imaging, had just been added.  Hunt said there have been reports of inappropriate comments on information in the past but this breach is well documented.  The discipline is in line with similar information breaches elsewhere.  In a report issued last November that looked into an information breach in Regina, the privacy commissioners office cited a similar event that was dealt with by the Prairie North Regional Health Authority.  PNRHAs employee termination and the arbitration decision that upheld the termination is consistent with other arbitration decisions in other jurisdictions such as Ontario and British Columbia, the report said. In one case, the arbitrator stated that zero tolerance should be the norm and only in compelling cases should termination not be the result of unauthorized access.  Asked if it was something that could happen again, Hunt answered by saying that the breach was not indicative of the behaviour of most health region staff.  I think the vast majority takes their responsibilities very seriously, Hunt said. The audits that we will implement will hopefully provide some confidence to our patients that we take this trust very seriously and we will work hard to ensure that our employees realize that curiosity is not appropriate when dealing with electronic health records.",http://globalnews.ca/news/1800984/privacy-breach-of-patient-records-in-prince-albert-health-region/; http://www.paherald.sk.ca/News/Local/2015-01-29/article-4025507/Employee-fired-after-medical-records-looked-at/1; http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatchewan-health-worker-loses-job-for-surfing-health-records-1.2936518

Prime Healthcare Services Inc., a fast-growing national hospital chain, said the attackers infiltrated computer servers on Friday at two of its California hospitals, Chino Valley Medical Center in Chino and Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville.  The company said the cyberattack had not affected patient safety or compromised records on patients or staff.  Two sources familiar with the investigation said the hackers had demanded a ransom to unlock the hospital computer systems, similar to what happened last month at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles. Hollywood Presbyterian said it paid $17,000 in bitcoin to hackers to regain access to the institution's computers.  Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare, declined to comment on whether Prime received a ransom demand or paid any money, citing the ongoing investigation.  ""This is similar to challenges hospitals across the country are facing, and we have taken extraordinary steps to protect and expeditiously find a resolution to this disruption,"" Ortega said. ""The concern now is to let law enforcement do their thing and find the culprit.""  FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said Tuesday ""we are investigating a compromise of the network at these locations."" She declined to discuss specifics of the case. The FBI also has been investigating the attack at Hollywood Presbyterian.  Ortega said the two hospitals affected remain operational and steps are being taken to restore their computer systems to full functionality. He said some IT systems were shut down by hospital staff as a preventive measure so malicious software didn't spread further.  hacker-computer-code-e1458648376542The company said it's working with data security experts and the California Department of Public Health on the matter.

A report, released under the Official Information Act, revealed the investigation occurred after a former colleague claimed the woman had been snooping into her electronic medical records.  The woman initially claimed she did not even know the complainant, but it was later revealed the pair had sat next to each other as administrative workers at Wellington Hospital.   A subsequent audit found the woman had not only breached her colleague's medical record, including her admission to the emergency department, but had accessed the electronic health records of 33 patients ""without an obvious legitimate need to do so"".  After further investigations, the DHB accepted that, in 28 of these cases, there had been no privacy breach. However, she was found to have accessed her own family's medical records five times without authorisation.  CCDHB chief operating officer Chris Lowry said the woman claimed she had permission from her family, but she had nevertheless accessed private health records to which she had no right.

As a result, some patients may be left in the lurch as their old medical information dating back to 2000 are unavailable.  The problem arose over the last two years when an American multi-national company, given the task of migrating a few million images of patients to the new system, lost the 46,000 images.  In an immediate reaction, the Health Ministry has asked UMMC to conduct an internal investigation to determine the cause of the computer foul-up.  However, UMMC director Professor Datuk Dr Ikram Shah Ismail said millions of images taken between 2000 and 2010 were safe and that the images lost were only a small fraction of the total.  He said the hospital is identifying other possible sources where the information could have been saved.  ""It is very unfortunate that the problem arose as the back-up hard disc overworked and failed. The company had to copy the images in a temporary hard disc and then convert them to the new format. It was during this migration that we lost the images,"" he told theSun.  He said the images did not involve patients who came for the first time after 2010.  ""Till today, we have not received any complaints from doctors or patients on the issue. I believe the doctors use recent or current images to do comparisons and treat patients.""

The back-up, he said, was important to counter any form of hacking or records being accidentally deleted. He said medical records are vital for doctors to manage and treat their patients efficiently and effectively.

Five medical facilities in Mt Annan, Holsworthy, Campbelltown, Eagle Vale and Harrington Park have had their medical records compromised.  Campbelltown Local Area Command crime manager Det-Insp Greg Inger said police searched a Rosemeadow premises earlier this month and found files from facilities in the five suburbs, including Mt Annan Medical Centre, which patients named on social media.  Police could not reveal the other facilities due to the ongoing investigation.  ""There appears to be a number of people involved at the moment and it's (the fraudulent activity) reasonably well co-ordinated,"" Det-Insp Inger said.  The extent of the security breach is not yet known, however, a number of people have reported on social media being the victim of the scam.  Karen Williams, of Narellan Vale, discovered her records had been compromised last week.  ""Back in July I saw a specialist, made an online claim and was waiting for the $70 to come back to me, but it never did,"" she said.  ""The second time I went, I asked for a receipt so I could go in and claim it in person.""  Ms Williams said she went to Medicare on Friday, September 11, and the staff member behind the counter brought up a screen that showed her account was being investigated.  ""She asked if I was a patient at the Mt Annan Medical Centre and was I aware my details had been compromised,"" Ms Williams said.  When the Medicare employee turned the screen towards Ms Williams, she saw that her bank details had been changed in her Medicare records.  ""They'd been changed to a Commonwealth Bank account with a man's name,"" she said.  Currans Hill resident Kristie Wilson, who is also a patient at the Mt Annan Medical Centre, found out she had become a victim of the scam when she received a Commonwealth Bank debit card in the mail that she hadn't applied for.  That card was linked to one of four new accounts opened in her name, of which Ms Wilson knew nothing about.  ""They put Medicare rebates of $70 in each account, transferred it into one and used cardless cash to withdraw it,"" she said.  ""When I went into the bank about it they said I was about the 15th person in the area they'd seen who it had happened to.""  Neither woman was contacted by the Mt Annan Medical Centre.

A report summarising the motorsport star's treatment after a ski accident in December was offered for sale last month after the 45-year-old was transferred from hospital in Grenoble, France, to a facility in Lausanne, Switzerland.  French police opened a criminal inquiry into the theft of the document, which prosecutors said consisted of several dozen pages that summarise the seven-time world Formula One champion's treatment.  ""The IP address was located in a helicopter firm in the Zurich area,"" the prosecutor's office in Grenoble said, refusing to reveal the name of the company or the alleged thief, but saying it had now passed the investigation on to Swiss authorities.  A report in the local newspaper Le Dauphin Libr said the firm had initially been due to transfer Schumacher from Grenoble to Lausanne, where he is now being treated after emerging from a medically induced coma.  The company had therefore been given a copy of the medical report which ended up being offered for sale to several journalists, the newspaper said.  Grenoble prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat said last month that the perpetrator or perpetrators of the theft contacted some French, Swiss and German journalists.  An individual, communicating by email, had asked for 60,000 Swiss francs (49,000 or 39,000) for the medical document.  The document did not appear in Schumacher's final medical report and was likely to have been a draft which had been left in a hospital bin, according to the prosecutor.  A source close to the investigation said the document appeared to be a summary written by Schumacher's doctor for his transfer to Switzerland.

The potential exposure occurred when a laptop was stolen from an employee's car. The laptop stored emails that potentially contained PHI such as names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, diagnoses, payer information and admission dates. No patient social security numbers or bank account information was included in the emails. Upon learning PHI may have been present on the device, Oceans immediately took steps to identify the individuals with the potential to be impacted. Although the laptop was stolen April 9, 2015, only recently, during an unrelated systems review did Oceans learn the device contained PHI. In May 2015, Oceans validated that all portable devices and laptops have encryption technology active and in use. While there is no indication the personal information has been acquired or used, free identity protection resources are being provided to individuals who may have been impacted. Because it is possible the PHI contained on the laptops may have been improperly accessed, federal and state law requires Oceans to notify potentially affected patients of this incident. This notice in print media is being provided as notification to individuals for whom Oceans has out-of-date contact information and therefore cannot be notified via letter. If you believe you have been affected, you should review your credit reports for accounts or creditor inquiries that you do not recognize.

Helene Kerney, 44, of the 200 block of Jan Drive in Lower Salford  who is free on 10 percent of $10,000 bail set at her preliminary arraignment last month  appeared Thursday at District Judge Harold Boreks court and met with her private attorney, Greg Gifford, before choosing to waive her scheduled preliminary hearing.  As part of the agreement, detectives withdrew five of the six charges lodged against Kerney: Two counts of third-degree felony access device fraud, and misdemeanor counts of theft, receiving stolen property and tampering with or fabricating physical evidence.  Kerney will be formally arraigned in Montgomery County court on April 15 on one count of third-degree felony access device fraud.  Towamencin detectives have said in court documents that on Oct. 17, a township resident contacted police to tell them that she had just received a call from her bank warning her about unusual activity on her credit card, specifically that someone twice tried to get cash advances with the card  once for $102.50 and another time for $202.50  but that the transactions were not completed due to the wrong PIN number being used.  The woman told the bank she had never used the card for a cash advance and suspended the account, then discovered the card was missing from her purse, according to an affidavit of probable cause.  A subsequent investigation determined that the card had been used on four occasions on Oct. 17 in the Telford area  twice within two minutes at an ATM at the Landis Market on County Line Road, and, about an hour later, twice within a minute at an ATM at the Circle K convenience store on North Main Street, according to the affidavit.  The total amount of attempted cash withdrawals was $611, the affidavit states.  Detectives were able to obtain video and still photographs of the alleged transactions, which depicted the same woman trying to make all the cash withdrawals, they said.  According to police, the videos and photos were shown to the victim and other family members, who identified the suspect as Kerney, someone they knew personally since for more than two years she had been a visiting nurse at their home to care for the victims husband, who had suffered a stroke.  When confronted with the evidence, detectives said, Kerney admitted she used the victims card at the Landis Market ATM, but said that she didnt remember going to the Circle K.  Court documents state that Kerney told police she was bipolar and in the midst of a manic episode during the time that the attempted withdrawals occurred, and that she couldnt remember stealing the card or what she did with it after attempting to get money with it.  Kerney was taken into custody by Towamencin police on Jan. 22.  Gifford said at court Thursday that due to the circumstances of the case, its possible that Montgomery County prosecutors may lower the grading of the access device fraud charge from a felony to a misdemeanor. Additionally, Gifford said, Kerney has no prior criminal record, which, he believes, makes her a good candidate for the countys Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) program, admission to which would mean shed avoid a potential jail sentence.",http://www.thereporteronline.com/general-news/20150227/caregiver-accused-of-taking-towamencin-womans-credit-card-waives-hearing

Arlington police said some time between the night of August 23 and the morning of August 25, someone pried open the door to Dr. Vonica Chaus practice off of Matlock Road and stole a computer. In a statement, Chaus attorneys revealed that computer contains the names, addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers of her patients. Investigators said theres no surveillance video of the incident  and they have little else to go on at this point. Dr. Chaus office, meanwhile, is reaching out to patients. At this time, Dr. Chaus office is in the process of informing the patients whose information was compromised and complying with all federal and state regulations to help protect these patients from any fraud or identity theft issues, her attorneys wrote in that statement. Personal information is valuable to an individual, said Dr. MK Raja, a professor at UT-Arlingtons College of Business. If they lose it, there are a lot more consequences. Raja is an expert in the field of information security. He says the loss of personal information presents greater challenges to victims than other types of identity theft or fraud because it cant be changed and often times, the company or public entity that was breached doesnt have an extensive response plan like a bank would. Its a lot of leg work for consumers, said Raja. If you think your personal information has been compromised, Raja says you need to immediately contact all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) and put either an alert or freeze on your credit. He then recommends you monitor your credit report. If not immediately, at least within the next three months, said Raja. You can get a credit report from each one of the credit bureaus for free once a year. Finally, he says you should file an identity theft report on the Federal Trade Commissions website and with your local police department. That way if any organization claims you have bought something or someone has opened an account or something happened that you didnt do, you can send them a copy, said Raja.",http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Break-in-at-Arlington-Dentists-Office-Puts-Hundreds-at-Risk-for-Identity-Theft-274547971.html

The recommendations stem from three incidents that happened in the RQHR over the past five years.   The first happened in January of 2008 at the Regina General Hospital. Some employees found out one of their co-workers was a patient in the health region, so they logged on to the health info program and looked at the co-workers information.    The employee directly implicated in the privacy breach was originally fired, but was reinstated after arbitration.   The second happened in June of 2009 in one of the health region's medical labs. A lab assistant tried to access her own files, and when she did, she discovered that someone had made several changes. Her name had been replaced with ""vulgarities,"" the sex and infectious disease information had been changed, and the acronym R.I.P. was in her file.   An investigation found that an employee had used seven different user ID's to change the woman's information eight times in three months. The employee would wait until other workers failed to log off a computer, and use their user identification to make the changes.   The final incident happened in November of 2011. After a complaint an internal investigation was done, and the RQHR found that an employee had looked up the health information of several people. She looked up the father of her child, his wife, four of the wife's relatives, and another unrelated person. In a letter to the privacy commissioner the RQHR said breaches ""appear to be intentional, malicious, and for personal gain.""   When the woman was interviewed about the breaches of privacy she said she was bored and curious, and that ""everybody does it.""   All personal health information is protected under Saskatchewan's Health Information Privacy Act (HIPA).   In his report, the privacy commissioner stated that after the first two incidents the RQHR made recommendations of changes it could make to stop breaches of the HIPA from happening again, but they never seemed to be implemented. The privacy commissioner said that's why a formal investigation was opened.   The report found that the administrative and technical safeguards the RQHR has aren't enough to keep information safe.    So in the report several recommendations were made. It was advised that the RQHR revise its safeguards within 120 days, and review its recommended actions for employees in the even of privacy breaches.   The report also suggested the RQHR institute a ""need-to-know"" policy, and well as some kind of policy regarding employees looking up their own health information as soon as possible.   It was also recommended that the health region look at its health information program to address any weaknesses in the system.

A Corvallis Clinic employee was attending a work-related conference in Portland in mid-November and had a personal laptop in their locked car. The laptop contained limited health information, according to a privacy disclosure posted on the Corvallis website.2014-01-27-87333166  Potentially compromised information includes patient names, dates of birth, name of treating healthcare provider, and the reason for a clinic visit. Social Security numbers or financial information are not believed to have been included. Moreover, only patients seen within the last two years are said to potentially be affected.  This was a breach of Clinic policy in that patient health information was reported to have been maintained on the employees personal laptop that had not been evaluated or cleared for use by The Clinics IT security officer, the statement read.  The employee reportedly notified supervisors and authorities within 24 hours of the theft taking place. While the incident took place in mid-November, Corvallis explained that it is notifying the public and media earlier than required by federal law. The clinic chose to do this because it takes the issue very seriously and is dedicated to the privacy and security of patient information.  While the laptop had a highly secure alpha-numeric password, Corvallis added that the data stored on the laptop was not encrypted. However, the clinic stated that is thinks a breach of PHI is unlikely.  The Clinics primary ethical responsibility is to our patients, the clinic stated. We are doing our due diligence to try to ascertain what information is contained on the spreadsheet and how many patients were listed. However, unless the laptop is recovered, the exact details of the information and the total number of patients listed may never be known.  This incident is another example of the importance of HIPAA administrative safeguards. Employees at all levels need to understand how to keep patients PHI safe at all times. For example, storing sensitive information on a personal laptop is not a secure way to transport data.  Another factor to keep in mind is that organizations could be found liable for their employees actions. Walgreens was told by an Indiana Court that it was responsible for HIPAA violations committed by one of its employees. The worker inappropriately accessed an individuals prescription medication information and exposed it to another person.  By choosing to appeal Walgreen has now created a precedent  confirming that privacy breach victims may hold employers accountable for the HIPAA violations of their employees, explained the plaintiffs lawyer, Neal Eggeson Jr.",http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/12/11/laptop-with-phi-stolen-from-oregon-employees-car/; https://www.corvallisclinic.com/clinic_information/patient-privacy-disclosure

On Feb. 12, DeKalb Health became aware a server controlled by a contract that operated DeKalb Health's website had been hacked. At that time, the health system discovered 17 of its patients who had utilized its online bill pay website had been affected by the breach. The affected patients' names, addresses, credit card numbers and Social Security numbers were potentially accessed by the hackers, according to the notification letter sent to those affected.  Shortly after discovering the bill pay website breach, DeKalb Health also discovered a fraudulent website  made to look like the health system's charity donation page  had been set up by the hackers. Using the fraudulent website, the hackers sent phishing emails to unknown individuals. DeKalb Health believes the phishing emails were sent to patients whose information was taken from the contractor's hacked server, according to the notification letter.    To generate more traffic to the fraudulent page, the hackers also altered DeKalb Health's main website by inserting a link to the fraudulent donation page.  On March 27, DeKalb Health discovered information for an additional 24 patients was included on the contractor's hacked server. The affected patients' names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, hospital ID numbers, insurance information, Social Security numbers, telephone numbers and demographic information were contained on the compromised server, according to the notification letter.    Subsequently, DeKalb Health discovered its database containing the information of 1,320 nursery babies was also contained on the hacked server. The babies' names, weights, lengths, dates of birth and parent names were on the server. The hackers also had access to passwords that would allow them to view the babies' information online, according to the notification letter.  As a result of the data breach, DeKalb Health has worked with the contractor to ensure the compromised server no longer contains DeKalb Health patients' information, and the health system is offering one year of free credit monitoring to all affected patients, according to the notification letter.",http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/1-361-dekalb-health-patients-information-compromised-by-cyberattack-phishing-scheme.html

The Office of Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data yesterday revealed that the Hong Kong Prevention Association (HKPA) made cold calls to people, offering them a chance to join a free medical check-up scheme and asking them for personal data. The callers claimed the checks were endorsed by the government, which was not true.  They also failed to explain clearly that the data would be transferred to Aegon Direct Marketing Services Insurance Broker, for use in direct marketing activities.  Aegon Direct paid for the information, which used it for promoting insurance products.  Privacy Commissioner Allan Chiang Yam-wang said the data was collected in a misleading and arguably deceitful way. He said the insurer was also accountable as it had approved scripts used by the association's telemarketers.  ""Such irresponsible and recalcitrant behaviour must be condemned,"" he said.  Chiang said the commission had received 11 inquiries and five complaints about the matter. It investigated three complaints. It found that the association had signed an agreement with Aegon Direct to sell data from at least 2,000 people every month.  Over the past two years Aegon Direct paid more than HK$10 million for the data obtained from 363,830 people and for any medical check-ups they had. In the end, about 168,000 people undertook simple kidney checks.  Chiang said callers had slurred through almost 400 words in one minute when it came to explaining how the data would be passed to Aegon Direct.  ""Once they mentioned the role of Aegon Direct, they would speak very fast. They only emphasised the free body check throughout the call,"" he said. The commissioner ordered the insurer to destroy all the data obtained from the HKPA, except information about those who had bought insurance, by the end of September. Failure to do so would be a criminal offence.  Aegon Direct said it had never authorised the association to say its promotional campaign had been endorsed by the government. The HKPA did not respond to Post inquiries.  Meanwhile, the commission also found that the way the MTR Corporation handled its CCTV footage was not good enough. It stored some footage longer than required and failed to use an encrypted device to transfer it.  The MTR, which has 3,342 CCTVs installed at stations and 429 on trains, said it would study the recommendations.",http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1210756/deceitful-firm-ordered-destroy-personal-data

A statement on their web site explains:  [_]  On October 24, 2014, we became aware that patient information was made potentially accessible on the Internet. We immediately began an investigation and learned that an employee used a thumb drive while working at home that contained patient billing information. While working from home, the employee connected the thumb drive to the home network, and a security vulnerability made the contents of the thumb drive accessible from the Internet. While connected, the documents and information on the drive could be located through a search engine, such as Google.  The thumb drive included patients names, dates of service, names of department where the patients were treated, refund amounts, and in some instances social security numbers. Credit card and banking information were not included on the thumb drive.  After we found out about this incident, we promptly took steps to remove the information from the Internet, including working to ensure the documents are no longer available through a search engine.  While we have no reason to believe that patient information has been used in any way, out of an abundance of caution, we began sending letters to affected patients on December 12, 2014, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions they may have.  If you believe you are affected but do not receive a letter by January 5, please call 1-888-266-9280, Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM Mountain Time.  We deeply regret any inconvenience it may cause our patients.

Oxelson, 43, had originally been accused of texting Delanois the nude shots of herself with the messages, ""Good luck loser"" and ""Can't wait for folks to see this one,"" according to the now-dismissed criminal complaint.  Oxelson, a Harvard grad, had made good money impersonating the disgraced golf great for more than a decade, earning as much as $3,000 an appearance.  Investigators soon discovered Delanois had allegedly stolen medical records of patients in a desperate bid to keep Oxelson in her clutches.  ""She told him she was pregnant with his child and showed him images of a positive pregnancy test, ultrasound and hospital lab work to prove it to him,"" Millendorf said.  NYU fired the nurse, who faces raps for falsifying business records, computer trespass, forgery, petit larceny and harassment. She turned herself in to the Manhattan DA's Office on Tuesday morning.  ""She still truly is the victim,"" said defense lawyer Michael Jaccarino. ""She denies the version of events that prosecutors are alleging.""",http://nypost.com/2015/04/21/tiger-impersonators-ex-allegedly-lied-to-cops-about-harassment/

(HHC) said that personal information of nearly 1.7 million hospital patients, staff, vendors, and contractors was stolen from a GRM Management Information Services van.  The data breach affected patients, staff, vendors and contractors at the Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital, and their two affiliated health centers. The personal information was collected over the past 20 years and included names, addresses, social security numbers, patients medical histories, and the occupational/employee health information of staff, vendors, contractors, and others.  HHC stressed that the files are not readily accessible without highly specialized expertise and data-mining tools, and there is no evidence to indicate that the information has been accessed and misused. At the same time, HHC admitted that it did not know where the files are.  The loss of this data occurred through the negligence of a contracted firm that specializes in the secure transport and storage of sensitive data, but HHC is taking responsibility for providing information and credit monitoring services to any affected individual who may be worried about the possibility of identity theft, said HHC President Alan D. Aviles.  The 14-hospital system said it was providing free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year to the nearly 1.7 million people affected. According to the Ponemon Institute, data breaches cost $204 per compromised record. That figure would place the cost of this data breach in the range of $350 million.  To recoup the cost, HHC said it was suing GRM Management Information Services to recover all of the costs associated with notifying all affected individuals, and to pay for other damages related to the loss of the data.  HHC said it reported the data breach to state and federal oversight, regulatory, and consumer protection agencies. Agencies notified include the New York State Attorney General, the New York State Office of Cyber Security, the New York State Consumer Protection Board, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and three nationwide consumer reporting agencies.",http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/15958/new-york-city-hospital-system-admits-to-massive-data-breach/

The employee, who has been dismissed, breached the hospital system's electronic medical records, allowing the person to gain names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, medical and health-insurance account numbers and other patient information, UH said. The electronic medical records also provide information on patients' office visits.  The employee also viewed information on some patients' Social Security numbers and personal financial account information, including credit card and debit card numbers.  ""This sounds like a very serious case of medical identity theft,'' said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit research group that focuses on privacy issues. ""It is serious when it involves one patient. This is a major breach. It's a big deal. It is no small thing.''  A spokeswoman for the hospital system, Alicia Reale, said it appears the employee simply was snooping, as it is not aware of any fraud or identity theft involving patients. She said the hospital has mailed letters to the 692 patients involved.  Reale would not discuss anything about the employee, including where the person worked or the person's job title. She said the information on the case has been turned over to law enforcement authorities.  The hospital system said it first detected something wrong when it looked into an allegation of unauthorized access to its medical system. University Hospitals discovered Oct. 2 that the access occurred from Jan. 25, 2011, through June 27.  Dixon said it could take up to two years before it is clear whether there is any fraud. She said in many cases data that is gained improperly is later sold to identity theft rings, who use it to pummel a person's finances.  She said medical identity theft became a trend in the mid 2000s, but it has become much worse in the past few years.  ""Usually, in a case with this many people involved, there is more to it than just snooping,'' Dixon said.  The hospital system said it has ""notified all individuals whose information was part of the incident and established a dedicated information line to provide personal consultation.''  University Hospitals said it also has sought out industry experts to examine the circumstances involving the breach of information.  It said it would provide one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to anyone whose Social Security numbers may have been accessed. It also said it would add more audits ""to minimize the risk of a similar incident in the future.''

TechWeekEurope understands that auction site is eBay.   Yet a member of public contacted NHS Surrey in May 2012, saying they had bought a computer online and found it contained patient information, including records relating to around 900 adults and 2000 children.  NHS Surrey then had to scurry around, finding another 39 computers sold by the data destruction provider, three of which still contained sensitive personal data.  The NHS body didnt sign a contract with the provider and failed to determine whether the hard drives have been wiped, the ICO said.  The majority of the hard drives put up for sale on the internet have not been recovered, meaning a lot of sensitive data remains online.  As NHS Surrey was dissolved in March, the NHS Commissioning Board will have to pay the fine. An ICO spokesperson said it had not received any appeal notice, whilst the NHS Commissioning Board had no comment at the time of publication.  The facts of this breach are truly shocking, said Stephen Eckersley, ICO head of enforcement. This breach is one of the most serious the ICO has witnessed and the penalty reflects the disturbing circumstances of the case.  We should not have to tell organisations to think twice, before outsourcing vital services to companies who offer to work for free.  Security expert Neira Jones warned of the potential fallout related to those machines that have note been recovered.  If they end up in the hands of criminals and the data is accessed (and it includes information on adults and children), who knows what it can lead to, and the very least would be ID theft, Jones told TechWeekEurope.  She said the latest fine was justified, but the contractor should still have been more responsible.  Should they [the contractor] be accountable? Definitely not, because NHS Surrey have been entrusted with the welfare of their patients. Should the contractor be responsible? Absolutely, yes, Jones added.  They have not deployed processes that enables them to treat media in a way that will not compromise the privacy of individuals, despite assurances to their clients that they would do so.  A Department of Health spokesperson added: We take the loss of personal data very seriously. At the time NHS Surrey contacted patients involved to make them aware of the data breach.  This case is currently the subject of legal proceedings.  The highest fine yet handed out for a data breach in the UK was one handed to the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012, after a similar case.  It was found sensitive personal data, including information on HIV patients and criminal convictions, was left on hard drives that were supposed to have been destroyed by a contractor but appeared on eBay.  The NHS has consistently been cited as one of the worst institutions for data loss, with numerous trusts caught out. Yet some have questioned whether such heavy fines should be levelled against such an organisation, when private firms like Google avoid fines for much-publicised breaches of the law, as in the case of the illegal Street View Wi-Fi data slurping.

Island Health says they have notified and sincerely apologized to the individuals who were affected by this breach, adding that if you have not been contacted, it was determined by their investigation that your privacy was not breached by these former employees.  According to Suzanne Germaine, Communication Officer for Island Health, in this case, these employees chose to use their unauthorized access privileges to the Electronic Health Record to satisfy their personal and medical curiosity about patients with whom they had no care relationship, but stresses that the public should feel that their medical information is secure.  There are a number of safeguards in place already to balance the access to the information care providers need to deliver care and services with the need to protect privacy of patients medical information, Germaine said. These include passwords, encryption, declaration screens (where a care provider confirms they have a care relationship to the patient), confidentiality agreements, policies and procedures, professional Standards, role based access (access is provided based on the job you have, your functions and need to know), reactive and proactive audits of chart accesses, education to staff, and, of course, compliance with provincial legislation, she added.  According to the release issued in regards to the breach, immediate steps were taken to ensure the employees access to any personal or confidential information was revoked, once the allegations were received in early October.  Germaine said its now up to the individual patients affected by the breach to decide if they want to pursue any legal action, and said, Island Health would cooperate with any police investigation, if any charges are laid by the Crown.  Dr. Mary Lyn Fyfe, Chief Medical Information Officer for Island Health, acknowledges the seriousness of such a situation.  It is extremely disappointing and completely unacceptable that staff members would breach a patients right to privacy, and it is a total violation of the confidentiality acknowledgement that must be signed by each of our employees and physician partners. It also violates the trust people place in us, said Dr. Fyfe.

Smith pled guilty on July 31, 2012. According to court documents, Smith was employed as a staffing manager by A Caring Hand Home Health Care Services, Inc. (A Caring Hand), a business located in Suffolk, Virginia that was owned and operated by Janice W. Holland.  A Caring Hand was authorized to provide home health care services, including respite care, to recipients of Medicaid.  Respite care services, as authorized by applicable Medicaid regulations, are designed to provide temporary, substitute care for a Medicaid recipient that is normally provided by the family or another unpaid primary caregiver of the recipient.  These services are provided on a short-term basis because of the emergency absence, or the need for routine or periodic relief of the primary caregiver.   From in or about January 2008 through October 2011, Holland engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain health care benefit payments from the Virginia Medicaid program.  Holland submitted to the program approximately 900 fraudulent claims for payment representing that respite care services had been provided to thirty (30) Medicaid recipients, when in fact no such services had actually been provided.  As a result, Holland obtained health care benefit payments totaling approximately $630,000 to which she was not entitled.   During the period from in or about September 2010 through October 6, 2011, Holland and Smith, and members of the staff of A Caring Hand at their direction, altered, falsified and made false entries in the office records of A Caring Hand to conceal and cover up the fact that Holland had submitted false and fraudulent claims for payment to the Virginia Medicaid program.  On multiple occasions, Holland and Smith met with staff members and directed them to alter, falsify and make false entries into office records, including the creation of false and fraudulent time sheets, in order to make it appear that the respite care services for which Holland had billed the program had actually occurred, when in fact they knew that no such services had been provided.  Approximately twelve staff members knowingly committed the alteration and falsification of office records at the direction of Holland and Smith, who were aware of an upcoming scheduled audit of the office records.  Holland and Smith committed these acts with the intent to impede, obstruct and influence the proper administration of the Virginia Medicaid program, which is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services.",http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/news/2012/12/20121217smithnr.html

The privacy breach also puts the patients at risk of identity theft because the files included their full name, address, date of birth, medicare number, and medical history. The documents were so comprehensive they included details about who the people lived with and what medications they were on.  Dr Peter Andrianakis from Prime Medical clinic in Sunshine West said while staff were moving from an office in Fitzgerald Rd to Glengala Rd over the Easter break, somebody illegally entered the old clinic and ""forced open a locked disposal unit containing copies of old patient care-plans"". He said these documents were meant to be destroyed by an approved contractor and were awaiting collection.  Instead, they appear to have been dumped in a local park. A woman who was walking her dog in Isabella Williams Memorial Reserve in Deer Park on Sunday found a burning pile of rubbish that included the medical records, old magazines and pamphlets for an old locum doctor service.  The woman, who did not want to be named, told The Age that at least 13 people's files had survived the fire. To protect the people's privacy, she picked up the remaining documents and took them to the closest police station. However, when she returned to the reserve on Wednesday, she said more records were littered throughout the park.  After The Age called Prime Medical about the discovery, Dr Andrianakis said he had since become aware that some of the patients records had been removed from the disposal unit and deposited in a local park.  ""All patients that could be identified to have been involved have been contacted,"" he said.  A spokeswoman for Victoria Police said police had returned the documents to their owner, but she would not name the owner. She said police were not investigating the matter any further and believed it was an accident. ""No further action will be taken at this stage,"" she said.  A spokeswoman for Brimbank City Council said it had picked up the litter in the park on Thursday, including the medical records which would be reported to ""relevant authorities"".  Victoria's Acting Health Services Commissioner Dorota Siarkiewicz urged anybody with concerns about the collection, use or storage of medical records to contact her office.  She said health services were obliged to comply with the Health Records Act 2001 which details how records must be securely managed. Anybody who fails to comply can be issued with a compliance notice.

Police arrested roommates Johnathan Knapp and Justin Goins in the spring of 2016 when they say the two used a stolen credit card to stay one night at the Hilton Hotel downtown. But when conducting a series of search warrants on them months later in the winter, police found 4,000 files belonging to non-profit organizations and medical offices in central Ohio, including patient files belonging to the Mount Carmel Medical Group. Prosecutors say the two would target specific storage units in central Ohio where they knew the files were located. At Public Storage in Westerville, the unit of a retired dentist was hit where court documents state he ""kept all of his clients' files."" Client files of the non-profit Impact Community Action were also stolen from its storage unit.The agency that provides social services to the poor sent this statement to ABC 6/FOX 28 about their part in this investigation. ""In May 2016, law enforcement officials from the Whitehall Police Department alerted us to an ongoing multi-jurisdictional investigation involving a series of break-ins at storage units maintained at an off-site facility. Law enforcement officials also informed us that our locked storage unit was among those broken into during these burglaries and that certain files containing client information were stolen from our unit. To date, the majority of those files have been recovered. Based on our investigation and the information provided to us by law enforcement, we have determined that this situation only affects a limited number of clients. IMPACT has notified all potentially affected individuals about this situation, through written notification via U.S. Mail. The notification includes actions individuals can take to help protect their personal information, along with an offer for a credit monitoring and identity theft protection service membership, provided by IMPACT at no cost to them."" - CEO, Mr. Robert “Bo” Chilton Police say the files obtained from Mount Carmel came from printing out copies from an office computer while visiting the office. The medical group released this statement to ABC 6/FOX 28. ""We are aware of the theft and have been working closely with the Whitehall Police Department from the beginning of the investigation. Protecting our patients' privacy and the security of their information is one of Mount Carmel Health System’s top priorities. We have notified all patients who we believe may have been impacted by the theft, as well as offered free credit monitoring services to help minimize risk. During the investigation, Mount Carmel provided all related information and collaborated with Whitehall police. Because of their thorough investigation, the stolen documents were confiscated by Whitehall police, and the originals were returned to us. At this time, we have no evidence that any patient’s information has been further compromised due to this theft. We take our patients' privacy seriously and work hard to safeguard their personal health information."" Police say once Knapp and Goins collected the 4,000 files of data, they consulted a freelance IT worker to determine what do to with the names. That IT worker told police he knew the two suspects through methamphetamine use and copied other client accounts while hired at a tax attorney's office in the Short North. Police say all the suspects opened numerous credit cards and bank accounts with the stolen data and prosecutors are still trying determine whose data they used and how many funds they collected.",http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/4000-files-stolen-from-medical-other-offices-in-organized-crime-ring

Regulations indicate the hospital has five days to self-report once it is identified patient information has been compromised. Sierra View is taking a proactive stance and is in the process of notifying the state of the possible breach, Contreras said.

The arrest, which took place Thursday, is the latest black eye for Partners in Care, a Manhattan-based service hit with a lawsuit in September alleging that its home health aide neglected and abused a 99-year-old Oakwood man in the months before he died.  Donna M. Howard, 29, of the 200 block of Targee Street in Stapleton, is accused of stealing the 93-year-old Dongan Hills woman's credit card on Feb. 15 and using it to buy beer at a nearby deli.  ""She was only a temporary aide for two days. She took the place of my regular aide that couldn't come in,"" said the alleged victim, who spoke to the Advance on condition of anonymity. ""When she came in, she was acting kind of funny. I didn't realize it, she was on drugs and she was drunk on the job. We found out later. I just thought she was a little peculiar.""  A law enforcement source confirmed that Ms. Howard admitted to police that she was drunk and had taken pills.  The Dongan Hills woman, who said she needs a walker to get around, said Ms. Howard acted over-familiar, offered unsolicited personal details about her life, and at one point, left to get lunch and returned with a can of Four Loko.  ""No wonder she was acting so crazy - she was drunk!"" the woman said.  The victim's daughter said Ms. Howard left the nearly-empty can in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator when she left.  ""(My mother) thought it was iced tea or something,"" the victim's daughter said. ""And there she was, drinking that on the job, when she was supposed to be taking care of a 93-year-old woman.""  The victim said she was likely in the bathroom when Ms. Howard took the credit card -- that was when Ms. Howard said she had to tend to her son, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia.  When the victim came out of the bathroom, Ms. Howard was gone, and the credit card had disappeared.  The woman said she knew to check because Ms. Howard had already borrowed $10, purportedly to buy food, and when she returned, she claimed she put the change in her pocketbook.  That's when the victim called her daughter, panicked. ""She was absolutely hysterical. I never heard my mother like this. It was so frightening,"" the daughter said.  The victim said she went as far as changing her locks, because she had lent Ms. Howard a key when she left to get food, and was afraid the aide had made copies.  A security camera captured Ms. Howard as she used the credit card at a deli at 1244 Richmond Rd., court papers allege.  When confronted, Ms. Howard told police, ""I took the credit card and brought beer,"" and, referring to the surveillance stills, said, ""This is me,"" court papers allege.  She's charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, fourth- and fifth-degree criminal possession of stolen property and petit larceny, according to information from District Attorney Daniel Donovan's office.  Ms. Howard was arraigned in Stapleton Criminal Court on Friday, and released on her own recognizance until her next court appearance on May 13.",http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/02/home_health_aide_with_troubled.html
A034B2DF-D01E-4721-A11B-10A2AE58ADD5,,,,2014,internal,misuse,True,False,False,server,s - database,5800.0,0.0,0.0,5800.0,unknown,,CA,North Bay Regional Health Centre,"North Bay Regional Health Centre could be forced to turn over medical information for almost 40,000 patients dating back to 2004 in a privacy case involving a nurse accused of illegally accessing data.  Melissa McLellan faces nine charges under Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act for collecting private patient data without consent while she worked at the hospital.  She is no longer employed there.  The defence raised a motion Tuesday that could force the hospital to release information from its patient database in order to challenge how the facility collected data that led to the charges in 2011.  The hospital learned about a possible privacy breach and was obligated to investigate, said its lawyer Deborah Berlach.  She said the hospital's analyst was an employee at the facility at the time and had consent to access the records. He was asked to generate a report which concluded personal health information of 5,800 patients had been accessed without consent.  The allegations have not been proven in court.  The hospital issued letters and media releases in 2011 to alert patients about the privacy breach based on information from that report.  The hospital has a way to track who accesses patient data, and the defence wants its own independent analyst to have access to that report as well as the complete electronic database at the hospital to test those findings.  The hospital is the custodian of that private information which is not in the hands of the province. That required the hearing Tuesday so the defence could argue why the court should order the hospital to hand over those third-party records.  Court heard the prosecution is no longer relying on the hospital's internal report that initially led to the charges. Ontario Provincial Police were brought in Monday with a search warrant to access the hospital's database to conduct its own investigation into whether files were accessed without consent.  The nurse's charges currently involve 48 instances of unauthorized access to patient files over nine days.  The police report isn't expected to be completed until Thursday.  Prosecutor Deanna Exner, representing the province, said the hospital should not be compelled to turn over patient records to challenge the original report in light of the new report being generated by police.  The defence argues the hospital records are relevant because they were accessed to create the original report that led to the charges in the first place.  The prosecution brought in the OPP to avoid the prospect of releasing private health information of almost 40,000 patients to challenge the original report. The nurse is not accused of accessing medical information of those patients, but they're part of the electronic database that is the subject of what should be turned over to the defence.  Justice of the Peace Lauren Scully is expected to give her decision July 5 whether the hospital must disclose information from its database so the nurse can answer to the charges and protect her right to a fair trial.  Court heard in March the defence plans to bring two motions to have the charges withdrawn, claiming McLellan's rights are being violated by the length of time it's taking to bring the charges to trial, and arguing selective prosecution that the nurse was singled out.  McLellan also faces a disciplinary hearing with the College of Nurses of Ontario. She's accused of committing professional misconduct between September 2005 and April 2011 by breaching the standards of practice in nursing and engaging in disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct by accessing personal health information of about 5,800 patients without consent or having a professional reason to do so, according to the college website.",http://www.nugget.ca/2013/06/11/hospital-defends-private-records

The company is providing notice to individuals that may have been affected by the incident and offering one year of complimentary identity protection services to those individuals.  On November 13, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) advised 21st Century that patient information was illegally obtained by an unauthorized third party who may have gained access to a 21st Century database. Upon learning of the intrusion, we immediately hired a leading forensics firm to support our investigation, assess our systems and bolster security. Based on this investigation, 21st Century has determined that the intruder may have accessed the database on October 3, 2015, which contained the personal information of some patients, including their names, social security numbers, physicians' names, diagnoses and treatment information, and insurance information. We have no evidence that patients' medical records were accessed.   The FBI asked that 21st Century delay notification or public announcement of the incident until today so as not to interfere with its investigation. Now that law enforcement's request for delay has ended, the company is notifying patients as quickly as possible. 21st Century continues to work closely with the FBI on its investigation. In addition to security measures already in place, we have also taken additional steps to enhance internal security protocols to help prevent a similar incident in the future.  21st Century has no indication that patients' information has been misused in any way; however, out of an abundance of caution, the company is offering one year of free identify theft protection services to potentially affected patients.  21st Century remains committed to maintaining the privacy and security of our patients' personal information.

Deputies were first alerted to the crimes on January 5, 2015. They determined Schlosser, who was working as a home health care RN for the victims, was a suspect.  Investigators went through Schlosser's patient list and found she had opened fraudulent credit card accounts in the names of at least eight patients.  Victim Geraldine Robbins said she knew something was wrong when she kept getting rejection letters from banks over credit accounts she never tried to open.  Deputies say evidence found on Schlosser's home computers also linked her to the crimes.  Investigators say she used the fraudulent accounts to buy iPads, DVDs and gift cards.  Robbins even got a $1,400 bill from a car repair shop after Schlosser opened an account there under her name.

Dallas City Hall stated that Dallas Fire-Rescue (DFR) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) laptop computers in DFR ambulances became unaccounted for in the three-year period. Additionally, on Aug. 15, 2014, it was discovered that one of the software applications on the EMS laptops was not properly protected.

Dallas reported the incident to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and also contacted individuals whose PHI is potentially at risk, according to the release. Due to some of the patients unable to be readily identified, the statement explained that notifications will be published in print publications, online and via first-class mail.

The NHS has acknowledged that it is investigating an estimated 2,500 cases in which patients may have been adversely affected by the undelivered documents, which included test results for diseases including cancer and treatment plans.  In total 708,000 pieces of correspondence were mistakenly stored in a warehouse instead of being sent to patients’ GPs or filed in their records, with about 200,000 of those being temporary change-of-address forms. The documents were handled by a mail redirection company hired by the NHS and had either been incorrectly addressed or were to be re-routed because a patient had moved to a new GP surgery. The private company, NHS Shared Business Services (NHS SBS), a joint venture of the Department of Health and outsourcing company Sopra Steria, has expressed regret over the issue, which took place between 2011 and 2016 and affected the East Midlands, the South West and north-east London. The firm ceased handling post for the NHS in March 2016, coinciding with the discovery of the delivery failures, according to a report in The Guardian. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt disclosed the data loss in July of last year, but at the time didn’t say how many patients were involved. The NHS said all the lost material has now been returned to some 7,700 GP surgeries.  A team of administrators gathered to investigate the failure is understood to be undertaking a review of patients who have died since March of last year to assess whether the missing documents may have played a role in those deaths.",http://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/nhs-loses-patient-documents-206267?PageSpeed=noscript

""How the hell have they done that? I'd like an explanation. I am extremely annoyed.""  They appeared to have been requested by the RD&E for clinics due to take place there later this month.

It is the fifth data protection breach involving confidential medical data in Bolton since 2009.  The sensitive data was found by 46-year-old Lynn Copeland on Good Friday near Plodder Lane News, in Farnworth.  It included four A4 pages which had details of 25 patients including their name, age, medical history, specialist information, mobility, dietary requirement, hygiene, home circumstances and discharge plan. The documents showed the name of the person who printed them out  at 6.33pm the day before  and said please destroy paper copy at the end of every shift.  Bosses at the Trust have launched an investigation and said they have apologised to all patients and carers.  A spokesperson said: We take all confidentiality issues very seriously and are extremely concerned by this incident.  Managing patient information legally, securely and efficiently is of paramount importance to the Trust.  We have spoken directly to the patients concerned and apologised to patients and carers.  An investigation panel is now being convened to carry out a full investigation. The incident will be reported to the Information Commissioner who will determine an appropriate response.

Montefiore announced Friday that it is notifying those patients that their information was stolen by a former employee between January 2013 and June 2013. The hospital wasn't aware of the theft until it was informed by law enforcement officials on May 15.  The Montefiore employee stole patient names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, next of kin information and health insurance details.  Susan Green-Lorenzen, Montefiore's senior vice president of operations, said the hospital launched a forensic analysis after it was tipped off about the potential theft. The hospital identified an employee who had improperly accessed information.The employee was fired, arrested and is now being prosecuted for the crime.  The Manhattan DA's office identified the indicted employee as Monique Walker, 32, an assistant clerk at Montefiore.   In a statement, Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, Jr., said ""we've seen how theft by a single company insider, who is often working with identity thieves on the outside, can rapidly victimize a business and thousands of its customers."" He said that the identity thieves often feed stolen information to larger criminal operations. ""In this case, a hospital employee privy to confidential patient records allegedly sold financial information for as little $3 per record.""  While Ms. Walker worked at Montefiore well beyond the date of the data breach, Ms. Green-Lorenzen said there was no evidence of criminality after June 2013.

The clinic, 2801 Rodeo Road, released a statement Friday afternoon saying the breach occurred July 14 for patients who had office visits between June 30 and July 13. We are sorry to report to you that on July 14, Santa Fe Medical Group became aware of a breach to your personal health information, the company said in a statement. An unidentified man entered the clinic at about 3 a.m. July 14, according to the statement. There was a theft of voice-recorded files from the providers, as well as cash and checks taken from the safe of Santa Fe Family Health. No credit card information was stolen, the clinic said. The clinic is owned by Atrinea Health, a company founded by Dr. Philip Briggs, a physician who started practicing in Santa Fe and has since opened offices statewide. In addition to Santa Fe Family Health, Atrinea also owns Coraz_n Family Health on Rodeo Lane and clinics in Espaola, Los Alamos, Las Vegas, N.M., Albuquerque, Rio Rancho and Los Lunas. Santa Fe Family Health offers both urgent and primary care. No other clinics were affected, said Tammy Payne, medical records supervisor with Atrinea. She could not say if patients were notified before Friday, adding that the company is doing what it is required under federal laws. We had to do an investigation with regards to the information, Payne said. She said Atrinea was providing the press the same information as it was providing patients, and that she could not elaborate. In its statement, the company said it filed a police report July 14, initiated a forensics security investigation, changed locks as well as policies and procedures, and initiated operational or technology updates or changes triggered by the incident to improve confidentiality. Celina Espinoza, a Santa Fe Police Department spokeswoman, said the initial dispatch log from 1:46 p.m. July 14 indicates that deposits were stolen from the safe, it but does not refer to other items. I dont know if they made us aware there was personal information, she said. A full incident report was not available Friday. It is possible, Espinoza said, that further investigation by the company showed the possibility of identification theft and that is why the company was now alerting the public.

What happened? A former employee allegedly stole patient data and used it for fraudulent purposes, and is now the subject of a law enforcement investigation.  What was the response? WRCBSS is reviewing its internal policies and procedures, as well as its technology safeguards. All impacted individuals are being notified.  Details: WRCBSS was notified by law enforcement on May 13 of a breach of information related to its billing files. The former employee who is the subject of the investigation worked for WRCBSS in 2011 and 2012. HHS.gov lists the breach as having occurred from Nov. 28, 2011, to June 29, 2012.  Quote: Presently, we are unable to identify the specific patients whose personal health information was actually stolen nor do we know which of those patients whose information was stolen was also used for fraudulent activities, Robin Hasty, office administrator for WRCBSS, wrote in the notification to patients.

Data at Union Memorial and other MedStar hospitals in Maryland have been encrypted by ransomware spread across the network, and the operators of the malware are offering a bulk deal: 45 bitcoins (about $18,500) for the keys to unlock all the affected systems.  Reuters reports that the FBI issued a confidential urgent ""Flash"" message to the industry about the threat of Samsam on March 25, seeking assistance in fighting the ransomware and pleading, ""We need your help!"" The FBI's cyber center also shared signature data for Samsam activity to help organizations screen for infections. But the number of potential targets remains vast, and the FBI was concerned that entire networks could fall victim to the ransomware.  According to sources who spoke to the Baltimore Sun, the malware involved in MedStar's outages is Samsam, also known as Samas and MSIL. The subject of a recent confidential FBI cyber-alert, Samsam is form of malware that uses well-known exploits in the JBoss application server and other Java-based application platforms. As Ars reported on Monday, Samsam uses exploits published as part of JexBoss, an open-source security and penetration testing tool for checking JBoss servers for misconfiguration.  The exploited vulnerabilities are in the JBoss Management Console (JMX), the command-line interface used to control JBoss-based application servers. The default installation of JBoss leaves JMX unsecured from outside access. The attacker uses these exploits to get remote shell access to the server itself and install Samsam malware onto the targeted Web application server. From there, the server is used to spread the ransomware client to Windows machines.

Frederick-based Service Coordination Inc. said it learned of the security breach in late October but didn't begin notifying affected individuals until Friday. Part of the delay came at the request of the U.S. Justice Department to allow for a federal investigation, the nonprofit organization said. Service Coordination said investigators have identified the alleged hacker and seized that person's equipment and accounts.  Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr in Washington said he could not comment on an ongoing investigation.  Service Coordination said there's been no evidence the information was misused or released. Spokesman Michael Baisey wrote in an email that the breach involved one document containing information for about 70 percent of the group's 13,900 clients.  He said his organization will assist clients and families in checking their credit reports and registering for a free year of identity theft protection.  Service Coordination is one of five private organizations licensed by the state's Developmental Disabilities Administration, an agency of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, to provide services, said Patrick Dooley, the administration's acting director.  Dooley said it was Service Coordination's responsibility to assist people with credit checks and ID theft protection because it had the breach.  ""We want to make sure people get the help they need.

Symbius Medical is also taking swift action to ensure that its HIPAA policies remain best practices to prevent similar breaches in the future. To that end, Symbius Medical continues to review and revise its HIPAA policies and procedures, implement additional technological and physical safeguards to its computer systems, offer additional HIPAA training, and modify personnel practices.  To mitigate any potential harm, Symbius Medical obtained a court injunction against the former sales representatives and their current employer to cease using this patient information and to immediately return the stolen data, is contacting its competitors to whom health information was disclosed to immediately return this data, is offering one year of free Lifelock credit monitoring to our affected customers and is reporting this incident to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Douglas Johnson, who represents the 24-year-old plaintiff, told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White that the proposed resolution would remove the county and nurse Shannon Lipham as defendants in the case.  The case will proceed against nurse Kristin Ciasulli, who the plaintiff accuses of taking the photo at County-USC Medical Center, and Ciasulli's then- employer, HRN Services Inc., Johnson said.  Johnson declined to state the amount of the settlement, but noted it would be public information if the Board of Supervisors approves it.  He praised the county's lawyers for working with him toward a resolution of the case, which was filed in October 2014 and identifies the plaintiff only as Jane Doe.  ""I absolutely think it was the right thing to do and I was impressed with the compassion they showed for my client,"" Johnson said.  During today's hearing, the judge said Johnson needs to shore up only one of the four allegations against HRN Services  intentional infliction of emotional distress. Johnson said the problem with the complaint can be easily fixed.  The attorney also said he was pleased that the judge found the details behind the other three allegations  negligent infliction of emotional distress, intrusion upon seclusion and negligent training, supervision and retention of an employee  were sufficient, and that White rejected a defense argument that his client didn't have an expectation of privacy in the large emergency room where her unauthorized photo was taken.  According to the complaint, the woman was admitted to the county-run hospital in June 2011 after trying to kill herself by thrusting pencils into her eyes. She survived, but was blinded.  Lipham was a relief pool nurse employed by the county who also was assigned to care for the plaintiff, according to Doe's court papers, which say Lipham acknowledged in a June deposition that she sent the photograph to her niece, who in turn gave it to a man named Joshua Shivers, who the plaintiff's attorneys allege posted the photo.  Ciasulli admitted during a deposition that she took a photo of the injured plaintiff and says she did so as a ""teaching tool."" She says she later deleted the image and that it was not the photo that turned up on the Internet.  Up to a half-dozen other medical workers took similar images of the plaintiff when the injured La Canada Flintridge resident was brought into the County-USC Medical Center emergency room, according to Ciasulli.  Ciasulli worked at the time for HRN Services, which supplies hospitals with temporary and supplemental healthcare employees.  Shivers uploaded the image in July 2014 onto ""one of the most visited shock websites in the world,"" the suit says. The same day, he took credit for his actions on a social networking site, saying, ""I finally made it in life. Please check out my shiz,"" and included a link to the photo, according to the complaint.  A week later, he placed the same photo onto a ""popular entertainment and social media website,"" according to the plaintiff's attorney, who says it has received more than 192,000 Internet views.  Ciasulli said she did not send a copy of the photo she took to Lipham.  Shivers in deposition testimony said he didn't know how the photo he posted was taken, but said it was given to him by Alexis Brennecke Siwek, the niece of a nurse at the hospital.",http://www.sandiego6.com/news/state-news/Pencil-stabbing-photo-leaked-hospital-staff-info-301922701.html; http://mynewsla.com/crime/2016/01/27/suicidal-woman-who-stuck-pencils-in-her-eyes-settles-part-of-suit-over-internet-photo/

According to the breach report posted on the healthcare provider's website, the privacy breach was caused by an individual with ""a retaliatory agenda against the clinic.""  A Children's Medical Clinics of East Texas employee was discovered to have removed business documents and taken them home, and failed to return them when requested to do so. It is not clear from the breach report when the incident occurred, but the decision was taken to report the matter to the police on August 10, 2015.  Following this incident an internal investigation was conducted which revealed the employee had also accessed patient medical records without authorization, and had taken a copy of the data and gave it to another ""disgruntled ex-employee,"" although the identity of that individual was not disclosed to the healthcare provider.  The data that were copied, by taking a screenshot, included patient names, diagnosis information, treatment details and dates of birth. Although not explicitly stated in the breach notice, it would appear that financial information and Social Security numbers were not copied or shared.  It is unlikely that 16,000 patients were directly affected, but Children's Medical Clinics of East Texas could not determine which records were actually viewed and copied. In situations such as this, all patients potentially affected must be notified that their privacy may have been violated.  The employee in question had been authorized to access medical records of patients as this was a requirement of her job. She had received training on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Rules covering privacy and security, so therefore committed the act knowing that she was violating federal regulations.  In this case, it would appear that the violation was committed to cause damage to the healthcare provider, and not to cause any patients to come to harm, financially or otherwise. While HIPAA Rules were violated, there is not understood to be a risk of patients suffering fraud or identity theft as a result of the privacy violation.  That said, patients are being advised to exercise caution and have been informed that they should obtain credit reports and monitor all accounts closely for any sign of fraudulent activity.  Children's Medical Clinics of East Texas will be monitoring the situation and has asked patients to call a helpline or send an email if they suspect they have suffered Identity theft as a result of the privacy breach, or if they receive a call or are otherwise contacted by a third party other than a member of the clinic in relation to the incident.  Credit monitoring services are not being provided to patients at this point in time as the risk of harm is perceived to be low. Patients have been advised that these services may be offered under certain circumstances.  The security breach has been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services, with the OCR breach portal indicating the report was received on October 28, 2015. Parents of the affected patients were sent a breach notification letter on October 8, 2015., alerting them to the privacy breach.  Additional protections will be put in place to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future, including new physical security systems. Further HIPAA training will also be provided to employees required to come into contact with PHI.",http://healthitsecurity.com/news/employee-theft-results-in-phi-data-breach-for-16k-children; http://www.hipaajournal.com/16k-childrens-medical-records-potentially-stolen-in-east-texas-8178/; http://www.childrensmedicalclinics.net/files/hipaa-breach-notice-letter.pdf

But against the hypothetical profit must be the real integrity of the loss should be considered.  This is a story about a divorce, a marriage and sex hacking. But most of all it is a story of what did not happen then.  A man and a woman in a small Swedish town met and liking arose. Man, we can call him Mattias, was married. He filed for divorce and remarried with his new love, ""Matilda"".  Eventually the couple trying to have children. It turns out to be easier said than done. Matilda is undergoing a hopeless series of miscarriages. She cared for on several occasions gynkliniken at the small town's hospital.  In the same hospital in West Bengal, but at another clinic, working Mattias ex-wife ""Jenny"". A log excerpt from last winter showed that Jenny was inside the Matildas gynjournal on six occasions during a three year period. A secretary at exfruns clinic had also logged two times. Sometimes incursions occurred in direct relationship with the care. Someone must have reasonably seen Matilda in the hospital and told Jenny - or about Jenny seen her himself. The timing between the infringement and care episode is a bit too good to be random.  Matilda contact the operations manager at the thief reading employees' clinic. After consulting with the chief-doctor she calls out the two employees. Jenny admits bluntly that she had nothing in the record to make. The secretary says she does not remember, but it may be that Jenny went into her login.  An insidious, intrusive and obviously illegal dialing in one case. A friendship corrupt alternatively sekretesslafsig - and possibly illegal - rapping in the other.  Six or possibly eight crime has been committed. But no one at the hospital makes a complaint. Either to the police or to the Inspectorate for Health Care, IVO.  I ask the hospital board's chairman about what rules apply when the crime is committed at the hospital. Zero tolerance, she replies, referring me to the hospital for safety for more details. From there the news just as resolute. First, do an internal investigation to determine whether any crime has been committed. Is that the case is always a police report, explains the security officers and refers to a policy that applies to the entire V_stra Gtaland.  The Principal does not seem aware of this policy. He speaks instead of ""action steps"" and that from case to case, determine how serious the crime is. Sometimes it can, he says, hand with a warning. In the second hospital can make a complaint to the National Board. First, on the third shelf are reported to the police as an option. What steps as are appropriate in this or that case determines the operations manager.  So then you have thus no zero tolerance, I ask. Yes, answers chief physician, we have zero tolerance. And he continues: ""But we police do not report all crimes"".  A benevolent interpretation of this contradiction is that hospital with the concept of ""zero tolerance"" express a pious hope on how it should be - and not a strategy to realize the ambition of zero violations.  The head has not allowed himself to be interviewed. But the chief physician describes the meeting. The head had a spin on action steps. Then she was left alone with his decision about how she would cope with the fact that two of her employees in a small community acquired more information about Matilda miscarriage and pregnancy than she might tell their closest friends. The operations manager was satisfied with a aja-baja.  How personal assessments and friendships may replace the principles and clear rules is one of the things that are outrageous in this story. But there's more.  Another found the head physician's negative response to my question if not the secretary's privacy practices indicates a need for training alternative upptuktning. He refers to all employees informed of confidentiality. He seems to think that if people do not understand, or do not respect, the meaning of it, well - then the hospital has yet run its course.  It also seems noteworthy that a chief doctor does not know where or if he should send a notification. He says it's to the National Board, and that if there are crimes committed as it is the National Board reporting. But it is wrong. On IVO's website, under the heading ""Clarification on the notification ', clarifies that it is precisely the authority notification shall be made. National Board no longer has any supervisory responsibility.  Since IVO not handled the case like lawyers reluctant to speculate on the outcome. Based on my drawing says, however, the lawyer Jonas Widell it sounds ""serious"" and ""that there is incredibly"" the Medical Responsibility Board would take a decision on so-called trial period in which the individual can maintain their identity but are under special supervision.  But any sanction for the nurse's really the least important here. More important situation is to fix the system errors and sekretesslapphet as Secretary sign indicates. And any gossip between clinics that led to exfrun informed that Matilda cared for in hospital.  The hospital has the Matilda request log extract, not through self-control, had a vulnerability served on silver tray. But instead of doing something about it sounds chief physician there remain.  Meanwhile, the V_stra Gtaland region to urge patients to allow medical records from various hospitals and clinics linked together so that more people can see even more.  During the ""Questions and Answers"" on the website is argued that the only ones who can read the journal is ""certainly identified qualified health professionals"" and that there should also be ""a patient / care relationship"". Furthermore, the patient ""must give their consent."" There is also stated that ""each caregiver making systematic follow-up of logs"".  However, nothing is said about what ""systematic"" means (perhaps the same thing as zero vision?). Or what to do when you find apparent infringements.  A plausible sequence of events is would have been if the hospitals first demonstrated that they can handle the trust before asking for more. Until the trust gap is walled up my advice to anyone who does not want to end up in the same situation as Matilda to exercise its right to block the Journal.  Regions Politicians and doctors tend to think it is irresponsible to call for this. What if someone comes in unconscious and you can not get access to any medical information?  Well, either that it makes use of the possibility of emergency opening available. Or you solved it the same way as when I worked at the SOS emergency room for paper records the time - that is, by looking at the patient instead of in the records.  I can not recall that I have heard or read about a single case where a man come to harm for that in an emergency could not control her psyk- or gynjournal. However, there are many examples of people who Matilda who come to spiritual harm to curious people are not able to keep hands off.",http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/hanne-kjoller-systemfel-serverat-pa-silverbricka/

But the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) at the DGH told Mr Foster the stick had been found in the street and believed it had been destroyed.  Mr Foster said: ""PALS at Eastbourne last week said they were under the impression the original stick has been destroyed.  ""But I have spoken to someone today at the Conquest and they said they could not give me any information that I wanted and they would get someone to contact me in the next few days.""  He said the whole episode had affected his wife's health.  Mr Foster said: ""Over the last 10 years my wife has been quite ill.  ""She was in the DGH between January and March 2011, much of that time in intensive care.""  He added: ""She suffers from depression anyway.  ""The fact this has got out into the general public depresses her even further.  ""And the fact we cannot get any information on it from the hospital is even worse.""  Alice Webster, director of nursing, East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said, ""We have written to each of the patients whose information was on the data stick individually to apologise and make them aware of the incident and the actions the Trust will be taking.  ""We are sorry for any distress this might have caused.  ""The information on the data stick had been collated by a clinician to support the individual in undertaking a clinical audit. The outcomes of these audits are to improve patient care.  ""The clinician mislaid the data stick and it was found by a member of the public near the Conquest Hospital.  ""The member of the public accessed the data stick and, upon realising what it contained, contacted our organisation and we collected the data stick from them.  ""The individual did not keep a copy of any of the information held on the data stick neither did they pass it on to anyone else.  ""We have retrieved the information from the memory stick and it has been destroyed.  ""We do have a policy that only specially encrypted NHS data sticks are permitted to be used in our organisation.  ""Unfortunately, in this case the clinician used an unencrypted data stick.  ""All staff have been reminded of their responsibilities to protect the security of patient information and follow Trust Policy.  ""We would like to reassure all patients that the Trust takes the security of their personal information extremely seriously.  ""Our investigation has shown that the data stick belonged to an individual member of staff and was not compliant with Trust policy.""",http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/confusion-over-patient-data-on-lost-hospital-stick-1-6875173

According to a consent agreement between the medical board and Dr. Aimee Hawley, during testimony she admitted to intentionally accessing electronic medical records of a colleague when they were a patient at St. Ritas Medical Center in September 2013. She also acknowledged that she was not treating the colleague, nor was she asked to consult or provide insights regarding the colleagues condition. She also did not request access or permission to access these medical records.  Because of these actions, the physician violated HIPPA and Principal IV of the American Medical Association Principles of Medical Ethics, which states a physician shall respect the rights of patients, colleagues and other health professionals, and shall safeguard patient confidences and privacy within the constraints of the laws.  Hawley did not return phone calls seeking comment.   Referring to the consent agreement, Beth Keehn, the director of marketing and communications at Mercy Health, St. Ritas said, s exactly what it looks like.  However, the violation did not occur through the main center, she said, instead occurring at an affiliated center Lima Radiological Associates.   Nicole Nelson, the director of St. Ritas Radiology Department, declined to comment.   The consent agreement, issued earlier this year, determined Hawley would be reprimanded and agreed to a probationary punishment for the violations, including quarterly declarations confirming compliance, a visit with a representative from the board for an in-person interview, providing documentation of completion for courses on professional ethics with a written report describing the course and how she will apply its lessons, and writing a formal letter of apology to the physician colleague whose records she accessed, in addition to providing a copy of the agreement to all employers and licensing authorities.   According to the Imaging Consultants of Findlay website, Hawley has been an American Board of Radiology certified practicing physician for more than 20 years, having spent 12 years with Lima Radiological Associates at St. Ritas Hospital and 12 years with the U.S. Air Force. While at Lima Radiological Associates she served in numerous positions including medical director of radiology, medical director of womens wellness center and chief of the medical staff.   She studied at Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, and completed her residency at Georgetown University Medical Center. Professionally, Hawley is a member of the American College of Radiology, American Roentgen Ray Society and Radiological Society of North America.",http://www.limaohio.com/news/news/153530342/Local-radiologist-charged-with-HIPPA-violation

Really, youd think the folks at Clinical Reference Laboratories (CRL) would have found a better way to mail packages by now. For the second time in six months, CRL is reporting a package damaged in the mail has created a data breach.  This breach involved tests run in connection with Nationwide Insurance applications. A package shipped around February 6th was damaged while in the hands of the US Postal Service (USPS).  We have determined that your personal information involved in this incident included your name, date of birth, the last 4 digits of your Social Security number and the type of lab test(s) conducted, CRLs Chief Compliance Officer David Porter wrote in a letter to potential victims.  Porters comments dont divulge the number of individuals involved. Last October, the Lenexa, Kansas firm announced a damaged package containing invoices had leaked Social Security Numbers (SSN) for an unknown number of individuals. Those folks had applied for insurance from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. At that time Mass Mutual refused to disclose the number of individuals involved or respond to any questions from idRADAR News regarding the breach.  USPS practices include segregating and then destroying any documents that become separated from their original package. Still, CRL is offering patients a year of free credit monitoring.  CRL has been in business for 30 years and processes 100 million tests annually. A data breach is probably unavoidable for a company this size but two of the same type in less than half a year is concerning.  A comparison of breach letters from the October 2013 incident and todays breach announcement shows theres been not much progress in CRL breach mitigation. Some lost invoices from the 2013 breach included full SSNs on the invoices; it would seem that this latest breach involves only the last 4 digitsa slight improvement but as hackers know, the final 4 are the most useful ones.  Hopefully, CRL will now figure out a better way to reinforce the packages it ships.

Dr. Nisar A. Quraishi, an internist with an office at 1 Chopin Court, told police Tuesday night that he was contacted by a resident of the neighborhood and notified that his storage shed door was open, according to a police report. Quraishi arrived at his office at 5 p.m. Tuesday and found that both latches on the shed door had been cut with an unknown cutting tool. When he entered the shed, Quraishi immediately noticed all of the medical records of patients he had treated between 1982 and 2009 -- and may still be treating -- had been stolen, the report stated.  Quraishi told police the majority of the records contained personal information, including social security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses and medical histories of each patient, according to the report.  The doctor said he had ""no idea"" who broke into the shed and stated that he had not been to the property since Aug. 10, at which point the shed was still secure, the report said.  Quraishi told police he was unable to immediately provide any of the names of the patients whose records were stolen from the shed, the report stated.  Police said there were no security cameras or witnesses in the area or at the scene.  Quraishi is listed as a specialist in internal medicine and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the NYU Langone Trinity Center in New York.

""The medical records of patients who were treated at NYU Langone by Dr. Quraishi are not part of the breach in question.""  Quraishi could not be reached for comment at his Jersey City office and did not return calls to his New York office.

Sandy Innocent operated Sandys Salon on the main floor of the Abbie J. Lane Memorial Building but said she was let go Oct. 9 after being accused of snooping in patients private medical information.  Looking at a chart, thats what they accused me of, Innocent said in an interview Thursday afternoon. I never did that in all the years I was there. I was there for 20 years and I never, ever looked at anybodys chart.  I wouldnt know how to read charts. It broke my heart. It just ripped me apart, honest to God.  Innocent, whos 55 and has been a hairdresser for 32 years, said she was called to a senior managers office and fired because two nurses had reported her on privacy breach allegations.  The hairdresser said she believes the trouble started a week before when she wrote her shops phone number on a piece of paper at a nursing desk.  A 90-year-old patient, who has since passed away, had asked Innocent for the shop number. The patient was a very good friend of Innocents husband, she said.  While she was writing on the slip, Innocent said, a charge nurse admonished her.  She said You shouldnt be behind the desk. I showed her the piece of paper in my hand, with my number on it, so I wasnt trying to hide anything.  Innocent said shes devastated that someone would accuse her of spying, and misses her job. She said the manager refused to tell her which chart was allegedly compromised.  She wouldnt even tell me that, said Innocent, adding she was only aware of the charge nurse complaining to management.  You put that many years into something, she said. I miss my veterans. You just cant believe it.  Everton McLean, spokesman for Capital Health, said management cant speak about the case because it involves personnel and patients.  We cant confirm specifics of any investigation, or (confirm) any investigation taking place, McLean said in an interview Thursday. If a patient file has been determined to be compromised _ that patient is notified.  McLean said he wasnt sure if any files at any hospitals overseen by Capital Health had recently been the subject of breaches.  I havent been made aware of anything thats happened.  There are minor and major breaches, he said, adding that the public is notified in cases of major breaches.  Innocent said she did the hair of patients from the Abbie J. Lane, Camp Hill Veterans Memorial Building and the Infirmary. She said she often went to visit the patients on the morning of their hair appointment to make sure they were ready.  Innocent said she felt humiliated when she was escorted out of the hospital on Oct. 9. (They) took my keys from my salon from me and left me in a hallway crying.  She said her husband has been in contact with a lawyer but to date shes been too upset to talk to legal counsel.  Innocent said she was initially barred from getting some of the salon chairs she owned out of the shop, but her husband managed to pick them up a couple of days later.  Innocent believes she was well liked at the hospital, and noted that the 90-year-old patient had tried to get managers to give her her job back.  The man has been good friends with my husband for 50 years. I kind of looked out for him. ",http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1249356-abbie-lane-hairdresser-devastated-over-firing

The recommendations stem from three incidents that happened in the RQHR over the past five years.   The first happened in January of 2008 at the Regina General Hospital. Some employees found out one of their co-workers was a patient in the health region, so they logged on to the health info program and looked at the co-workers information.    The employee directly implicated in the privacy breach was originally fired, but was reinstated after arbitration.   The second happened in June of 2009 in one of the health region's medical labs. A lab assistant tried to access her own files, and when she did, she discovered that someone had made several changes. Her name had been replaced with ""vulgarities,"" the sex and infectious disease information had been changed, and the acronym R.I.P. was in her file.   An investigation found that an employee had used seven different user ID's to change the woman's information eight times in three months. The employee would wait until other workers failed to log off a computer, and use their user identification to make the changes.   The final incident happened in November of 2011. After a complaint an internal investigation was done, and the RQHR found that an employee had looked up the health information of several people. She looked up the father of her child, his wife, four of the wife's relatives, and another unrelated person. In a letter to the privacy commissioner the RQHR said breaches ""appear to be intentional, malicious, and for personal gain.""   When the woman was interviewed about the breaches of privacy she said she was bored and curious, and that ""everybody does it.""   All personal health information is protected under Saskatchewan's Health Information Privacy Act (HIPA).   In his report, the privacy commissioner stated that after the first two incidents the RQHR made recommendations of changes it could make to stop breaches of the HIPA from happening again, but they never seemed to be implemented. The privacy commissioner said that's why a formal investigation was opened.   The report found that the administrative and technical safeguards the RQHR has aren't enough to keep information safe.    So in the report several recommendations were made. It was advised that the RQHR revise its safeguards within 120 days, and review its recommended actions for employees in the even of privacy breaches.   The report also suggested the RQHR institute a ""need-to-know"" policy, and well as some kind of policy regarding employees looking up their own health information as soon as possible.   It was also recommended that the health region look at its health information program to address any weaknesses in the system.",http://www.cjme.com/story/report-slams-regina-quappelle-health-region-privacy-breaches/96232

The black plastic ribbons, which appear to contain counterfoil prescription label information, include patients' names, dates-of-birth, addresses and doctor details. They also include confidential NHS patient numbers.  This find has raised concerns about sensitive information falling into the hands of criminals and prompted the watchdog Healthwatch Dorset to call for an urgent investigation.  A number of the black plastic ribbons were discovered by a business owner along Warwick Place, an alleyway adjacent to Christchurch Road, close to Pokesdown railway station.  The man, who asked not to be named, collected them up on Thursday. ""They were just floating about in the alleyway,"" he said. ""It was only the second day when I walked past that I noticed the barcode on them.  ""At first I thought they contained credit card information, but then I realised it was medical information.  ""So I went along and picked them all up.""  After contacting the Echo we took possession of the patient details and have since passed them to the NHS.  No medical details were contained on the plastic strips but the information included could easily be used to obtain further forms of false identification.  The man who found them said: ""I just thought they were strips of bin bags at first, they'd been there for at least a couple of days.  ""There is a lot of information, date of birth, names, addresses and NHS numbers. This information in the wrong hands could be used for all sorts.""  Healthwatch Dorset manager Martyn Webster said it was very worrying to hear that the information had been found in the street. ""There needs to be an urgent investigation to discover how this happened and the public needs to know that steps have been taken to make sure it never happens again,"" he stressed.

This one involves Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (Lahey Clinic Hospital), who have agreed to pay $850,000 and to adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  Lahey is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with Tufts Medical School, providing primary and specialty care in Burlington, Massachusetts. The incident involved the theft of a laptop with 599 patients' protected health information.  Although there is no press release issued yet, according to the Resolution Agreement, Lahey notified HHS in October, 2011 that the unencrypted laptop was used in connection with a computerized tomography (""CT"") scanner. The laptop was reportedly stolen from an unlocked treatment room off of the inner corridor of Lahey's Radiology Department.  In investigating the incident, OCR found that  Lahey failed to conduct an accurate and thorough analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its ePHI as part of its security management process. See 45 C.F.R. 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Lahey failed to implement reasonable and appropriate physical safeguards for a workstation that accesses ePHI to restrict access to authorized users. See 45 C.F.R.  164.310(c). With respect to the workstation, Lahey failed to implement policies and procedures that govern the receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain ePHI into and out of its facility, and the movement of these items within its facility. See 45 C.F.R.  164.310(d)(1). Lahey failed to assign a unique user name for identifying and tracking user identity with respect to the aforementioned workstation. See 45 C.F.R.  164.312(a)(2)(i). Lahey did not implement a mechanism to record and examine activity on the workstation at issue in this breach. See 45 C.F.R.  164.312(b). Lahey impermissibly disclosed the ePHI of 599 individuals for a purpose not permitted by the Privacy Rule. See 45 C.F.R.  164.502(a). In addition to the $850,000 fee, Lahey has agreed, without any admissions or concessions, to a multi-element corrective action program, detailed in the Resolution Agreement.

Additionally, the health-care system, which was already in the process of an independent assessment of its information systems, has taken additional steps to safeguard its records as a result of the theft.  Although it is unlikely that information on the tapes will be compromised, we are nevertheless taking aggressive steps to protect our patients confidentiality, said Lorris Betz, M.D., Ph.D, Senior Vice President for Health Sciences.   A metal box containing the backup tapes, which contained billing records for approximately 2.2 million patients and guarantors, was stolen on Monday, June 2, from a car belonging to a driver who worked for an independent storage company contracted by the health-care system. The driver violated the protocols his company had established to ensure secure data transportation.   The Salt Lake County Sheriffs Department, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service are investigating the theft.  The investigation indicates that the theft was probably a random car burglary, and there is no evidence that the information on the tapes has been accessed or used for identity theft, said Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder.  Having concluded the first phase of our investigation, we believe it is now time to bring this issue to the publics attention so that we can enlist their help in recovering the tapes.  The University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics is offering a $1,000 reward for the return of the tapes, no questions asked.  Those wishing to claim the reward may call the Sheriffs Department at (801) 743-7000.  The billing records included patient names, related demographic information and diagnostic codes.  None of the records contained credit card information.  Records for a subset of 1.3 million patients also contained Social Security numbers.  The company contracted by the university to transport and store the tapes, Perpetual Storage Inc., said this is the first and only such incident in its 40-year history.  It also said that the employee who left the tapes in his car had been with the company for nearly 18 years.  Nevertheless, The University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics has suspended deliveries of backup tapes to Perpetual Storage pending the review of all procedures and protocols for transporting and storing backup data.  Additionally, the health-care system is taking the following steps on behalf of its 2.2 million patients.      Mailing notification letters to all 2.2 million patients and guarantors;     Providing free credit monitoring and restoration service to patients whose records included Social Security numbers;     Providing a toll-free information line at 1-866-581-3599 to respond to questions; and     Establishing a website at http://healthcare.utah.edu/billingrecordstheft that provides information and resources.

Hawkins Mental Health Center,"OOfficials are investigating a security and privacy breach affecting 900 patients who were treated at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center's mental health facility.  The breach was discovered April 3 during a search of the home of a nurse who was employed at the Augustus F. Hawkins Mental Health Center, said Michael Wilson, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. The investigation was not related to county business, he said.  The nurse, whose name wasn't released, allegedly stole documents containing patients' names, medical and insurance information, birth dates, Social Security numbers, diagnoses and other personal information.  The nurse has since resigned and is no longer working with the hospital, Wilson said.  Patients treated at the Hawkins facility between 2011 and 2015 were affected by the breach, he said.  It was unclear whether any of the patients' information was misused.  A county team assigned to investigate breaches under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is conducting an internal probe.  County officials have notified the patients by letter as well as the California Department of Public Health. A notice of the breach was also posted on the hospital's website.  The Los Angeles County district attorney's Cyber Investigation Response Team is looking into the breach, spokeswoman Jane Robison said. Details about the breach were not released because the case is under investigation.  County health employees must undergo privacy training as well as follow a series of procedures designed to protect patient confidentiality.  ""Despite all of these procedures, these incidents still happen,"" Wilson said.  Meanwhile, free credit monitoring services of up to a year were offered to the affected patients.",http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-county-usc-data-breach-20150429-story.html; http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/apr/29/personal-data-on-900-los-angeles-county-patients/

Hospital officials say 14 staff members who provide mental health services have been disciplined over the privacy breach, which occurred during a 10-year period between December 2004 and summer 2014.  Were letting the community know, were advising patients -- those who have had their records accessed -- that its formally a privacy breach, said Kevin Empey, the hospitals president and CEO. We have engaged the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario to make sure were following their protocol on how we communicate with patients and manage the issue.  The breach was flagged by auditing software that monitors access to patient records. Mr. Empey said that only staff who are in a patients circle of care -- directly involved in their treatment -- should be looking at electronic health records.  The 14 staff members had been accessing information about previous patients as well as patients family members.  What we have concluded is this was curiosity or concern about people that had been patients of theirs before, said Mr. Empey.  He said the information was not sold or released outside of the hospital, as was the case at Rouge Valley Health Systems where a former clerk was recently charged with selling information of about 8,300 patients to financial companies.  To (the 14 Lakeridge staff involved) it was an innocent check; maybe someone was in a different department before and they went are they OK?, said Mr. Empey. Staff rationalized it as its just my eyes ... its not like the Rouge scenario where Im selling something.  Hospital officials are attempting to contact every patient whose records were inappropriately accessed and Mr. Empey said about 20 have contacted the hospital with follow-up questions.  What weve done is weve written a letter to all of the patients, were following up with phone calls, some of them are proving hard to locate.  Though he said 14 staff members were disciplined, Mr. Empey did not specify what form the discipline took, saying that in some cases it was minor and in some cases it was major.  Lakeridge staff sign a code of conduct when theyre hired that includes provisions on patient privacy and as a result of the incident Mr. Empey said staff will be asked to sign the code of every year as a reminder of their responsibilities.  Further, as president and CEO he will be raising the issue of privacy with staff.  Its very upsetting, Im not at all happy about this and its made me realize I havent been talking about privacy, its just expected thats how we should behave, he said.  Mr. Empey said the hospital continues to improve the detection side and the auditing process for finding privacy breaches and said the auditing team has started contacting other hospitals to learn from them. There will also be some restrictions on what portion of patient records staff can access, but Mr. Empey said there are challenges to limiting access for hospital workers.  We have to make sure we dont tie ourselves in knots and prevent health care from happening, he said.  However, he doesnt believe a solution will come through software.  The fundamental control is not the computer program, its the awareness and the staff understanding their responsibility to treat the information very carefully.  As to whether he expects a lawsuit as a result of the privacy breach, Mr. Empey said he doesnt know, but he said theres no evidence the information has been used for any purpose that would harm anyone.  Mr. Empey points out that 578 may be a large number but across Durham, Lakeridge serves 250,000 to 300,000 patients per year.  This is a problem and were working on it but this isnt as if all patients had a problem at Lakeridge Health.",http://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/5159653-lakeridge-health-reports-578-patient-records-inappropriately-accessed/; http://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/5177332-lakeridge-health-privacy-breach-in-oshawa-a-wake-up-call-on-protecting-patient-records/

The Social Security numbers, medical insurance information, names, and addresses of patients have potentially been compromised as a result of the loss of a portable storage device used to store data backups.  Late last year, Blue Chip Dental implemented a backup system to better protect patient data. The backup system was installed ""to store our digital information offsite in case of fire or other disaster to our building,"" according to the substitute breach notice placed on the company website. The backup system was part of a $25,000 digital security overhaul.  On January 26, 2016, a portable storage device used for the backup system was discovered to have gone missing. No evidence has been uncovered to suggest data have been obtained or accessed inappropriately although the missing backup drive has now been declared lost.  Blue Chip Dental contacted the firm used to install the digital security system and was initially told that data stored on the drive was not at risk of being exposed. However, three weeks later Blue Chip Dental was informed that was not the case, and data on the drive could potentially be accessed. It is not clear from the breach notice whether the system included data encryption for backup files and an error had been made configuring the system, or whether the backup system did not encrypt data.  In response to the breach, Blue Chip Dental's IT providers ""have fixed the issue with the portable hard drives."" Higher levels of security have also been implemented to prevent future breaches of this nature from occurring.  This incident highlights just how important it is for HIPAA-covered entities to only deal with vendors that are able to confirm that their systems, or the systems they install, offer the necessary protections required by HIPAA. Vendors must also sign a business associate agreement (BAA) to this effect.  If a covered entity implements an IT system that they have assurances offers the required level of protection for ePHI and a compliant, signed BAA has been obtained, liability for a data breach may be avoided.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/2200-michigan-dental-patients-warned-of-phi-breach-3374/

(WHNT)  In a WHNT News 19 exclusive report, we told you about hundreds of medical files found inside dumpsters around the Shoals.  These records were from a hospital out-of-state, so WHNT News 19 did some digging and found the doctor cited in those files has been practicing in the Shoals.  The files were from a clinic in Virginia.  However the doctor cited in those records has been practicing as an independent physician at Helen Keller Hospital for less than a year.  The slogan on top of the medical files says, Specializing in You, Our Patient.  However hundreds of the doctors former patients back in Virginia, have no idea their information ended up scattered in the trash, nearly 400 miles away.  WHNT News 19 tried to contact the physician listed in the medical records to find out how these confidential files got in the hands of a Florence man.  During a telephone call, a family member told WHNT News 19, the doctor was out of town caring for a sick relative.  However, the doctors family member stated the physician hired a company to shred the documents, and then dispose of the papers in the landfill.  The family member would not reveal to WHNT News 19 the name of that document destruction service or who was supposed to be responsible for taking those documents to the dump.  WHNT News 19 also notified the hospital in Norton, Virginia, where the files originated about the found medical records.   A privacy officer from the healthcare alliance says this is a big concern and claims there are rules and regulations in place to hold physicians accountable for their charts.  If the doctor is moving to Alabama, I wouldn`t necessarily think they would take their records, but they are still liable for those records as a physician/practitioner so, maybe they took them, and wanted to go through them, but again that is all speculation from me, said Donna Coomes, a privacy investigator for the Mountain States Health Alliance.  At this time, WHNT News 19 is not revealing the doctors name because the medical records are not of patients from the Tennessee Valley.  WHNT News 19 is still tracking down why exactly the files ended up in unsecured dumpsters.      However, since we broke this story, WHNT News 19 has learned this doctor is no longer practicing in Sheffield.  A sign left on the doctors office door states he has moved out of the area due to family health issues.  A local Shoals doctor has agreed to take over his patients.",http://whnt.com/2013/01/30/out-of-state-medical-records-found-in-dumpster-linked-to-shoals-doctor/

The hackers also were able to access demographic and partial credit card information for nearly 7,000 patients. However the hackers didn't gain access to patients' medical records, which are housed in a different system, Western Montana Clinic CEO Valeri Saffer said.  ""We are very fortunate that no medical information was available on the site that would have been hacked,"" she said.   It appears the hackers, who call themselves the Moroccan Agent Secrets, weren't looking for personal information, but were looking for site vulnerability, Saffer explained.  ""I've been told a good hacker can get into anywhere,"" she said.  Saffer said the hackers bypassed security measures and accessed the website for the first time March 10. By March 14, the hackers had changed the homepage and WMC employees became aware of the attack.    The hackers made it impossible for users to access the website, and instead routed them to a separate site that contained anti-Israeli and anti-American sentiments.   ""We found out about it from a patient who called a staffer and we called the organization that hosts the website,"" Saffer said. Within hours, the site was taken down.   In investigating the incident, WMC employees discovered the presence of patients' credit card information on the site.  ""When our IT people took the site apart, they found there was a log on the site that had that (credit card) information in it,"" Saffer said. ""It shouldn't have had that information in it, but it did.""    In addition to accessing the full credit card information of 44 patients, the names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates and amounts of credit card transactions made via the website, and the last four four digits of credit card numbers for 6,994 patients were available to the hackers.  The clinic alerted the FBI to the hacking incident, and affected patients affected were notified by mail.

A release from Green's office says Barnes stole Medicaid information from patients who came there for detoxification and other addiction services, and used the information to pay for prescription drugs. By using patient's Medicaid, she was able to pay in one instance $3 for a nearly $1,800 prescription for the opiate pain killers.   Once she obtained the drugs via 61 false prescriptions, she directed staff to lock them in her office.   The patients -- some who had already left the center before the prescriptions were ever written -- never received the medication or knew prescriptions had been filled in their name.

Acting Assistant Attorney General David A. ONeil of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Andr Birotte Jr. of the Central District of California, Assistant Director in Charge Bill Lewis of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office and Special Agent in Charge Glenn R. Ferry of the Los Angeles Region of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) made the announcement.  Vahe Tahmasian, 36, of Glendale, Calif., was found guilty on March 21, 2014, in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, six counts of health care fraud and six counts of aggravated identity theft. Sentencing is set for June 9, 2014.  The evidence introduced at trial showed that between April 2009 and February 2011, Tahmasian operated a Medicare fraud scheme at Orthomed Appliance Inc. (Orthomed), a DME supply company in West Hollywood, Calif. Tahmasian and his co-conspirator, Eric Mkhitarian, purchased Orthomed from the previous owners and put the company in the name of a straw owner. The defendant and his co-conspirator then stole the personal identifying information of Medicare beneficiaries and doctors in the companys patient files and used that information to submit a large volume of fraudulent claims to Medicare. The evidence showed that during a three-month period in late 2010, Tahmasian submitted more than $1.2 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare for services that were never prescribed by a physician and never provided to the Medicare beneficiaries. Tahmasian and his co-conspirator then took out more than $622,000 in cash from the company over a six-week period in early 2011. The evidence at trial showed that Tahmasian used a fake California drivers license during the course of the fraudulent scheme. Tahmasian submitted a total of $1,584,640 in claims to Medicare and received approximately $994,036 on those claims.  Mkhitarian, Tahmasians alleged co-conspirator, remains a fugitive.  The case was investigated by the FBI and the Los Angeles Region of HHS-OIG and brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, under the supervision of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Benton Curtis and Trial Attorney Alexander Porter of the Fraud Section.

The recommendations stem from three incidents that happened in the RQHR over the past five years.   The first happened in January of 2008 at the Regina General Hospital. Some employees found out one of their co-workers was a patient in the health region, so they logged on to the health info program and looked at the co-workers information.    The employee directly implicated in the privacy breach was originally fired, but was reinstated after arbitration.   The second happened in June of 2009 in one of the health region's medical labs. A lab assistant tried to access her own files, and when she did, she discovered that someone had made several changes. Her name had been replaced with ""vulgarities,"" the sex and infectious disease information had been changed, and the acronym R.I.P. was in her file.   An investigation found that an employee had used seven different user ID's to change the woman's information eight times in three months. The employee would wait until other workers failed to log off a computer, and use their user identification to make the changes.   The final incident happened in November of 2011. After a complaint an internal investigation was done, and the RQHR found that an employee had looked up the health information of several people. She looked up the father of her child, his wife, four of the wife's relatives, and another unrelated person. In a letter to the privacy commissioner the RQHR said breaches ""appear to be intentional, malicious, and for personal gain.""   When the woman was interviewed about the breaches of privacy she said she was bored and curious, and that ""everybody does it.""   All personal health information is protected under Saskatchewan's Health Information Privacy Act (HIPA).   In his report, the privacy commissioner stated that after the first two incidents the RQHR made recommendations of changes it could make to stop breaches of the HIPA from happening again, but they never seemed to be implemented. The privacy commissioner said that's why a formal investigation was opened.   The report found that the administrative and technical safeguards the RQHR has aren't enough to keep information safe.    So in the report several recommendations were made. It was advised that the RQHR revise its safeguards within 120 days, and review its recommended actions for employees in the even of privacy breaches.   The report also suggested the RQHR institute a ""need-to-know"" policy, and well as some kind of policy regarding employees looking up their own health information as soon as possible.   It was also recommended that the health region look at its health information program to address any weaknesses in the system.

His conduct had been reported to the hospital by a female co-worker and he was fired. The files were found in his home after he committed suicide. In March of 2013, some of his patients filed a potential class action lawsuit.  Today, Justin Fenton of the Baltimore Sun reports that Johns Hopkins Hospital has reached a proposed settlement for a lawsuit filed last fall. The settlement involves $190million.  As Fenton notes, the settlement, if approved, might be the largest of its kind:  The settlement may be the largest of its kind. A class-action suit involving a Delaware pediatrician convicted of recording assaults on hundreds of children led to a $120 million settlement in 2012. That same year, a Connecticut hospital settled for about $50 million with 150 victims of an endocrinologist who used a medical study as a pretense to take obscene photographs of children.  []  In court papers, plaintiffs also contended that Levy engaged in doctor-patient boundary violations during the course of his patients treatment, including an excessive number of unnecessary pelvic exams and engaging in inappropriate physical contact. Some said Levy practiced without medical professionals on hand as observers, a routine hospital practice for the safety of patients and doctors.  Hopkins said it had identified more than 12,500 potential victims.  Read more on Baltimore Sun. Associated Press provides additional coverage.  Somewhat surprisingly, this incident does not seem to be recorded at all in HHSs public breach tool.

(the Company) confirmed that its computer network was the target of an external, criminal cyber attack that the Company believes occurred in April and June, 2014. The Company and its forensic expert, Mandiant (a FireEye Company), believe the attacker was an Advanced Persistent Threat group originating from China who used highly sophisticated malware and technology to attack the Companys systems. The attacker was able to bypass the Companys security measures and successfully copy and transfer certain data outside the Company. Since first learning of this attack, the Company has worked closely with federal law enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation and possible prosecution of those determined to be responsible for this attack. The Company also engaged Mandiant, who has conducted a thorough investigation of this incident and is advising the Company regarding remediation efforts. Immediately prior to the filing of this Report, the Company completed eradication of the malware from its systems and finalized the implementation of other remediation efforts that are designed to protect against future intrusions of this type. The Company has been informed by federal authorities and Mandiant that this intruder has typically sought valuable intellectual property, such as medical device and equipment development data. However, in this instance the data transferred was non-medical patient identification data related to the Companys physician practice operations and affected approximately 4.5 million individuals who, in the last five years, were referred for or received services from physicians affiliated with the Company. The Company has confirmed that this data did not include patient credit card, medical or clinical information; the data is, however, considered protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) because it includes patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers. The Company is providing appropriate notification to affected patients and regulatory agencies as required by federal and state law. The Company will also be offering identity theft protection services to individuals affected by this attack. The Company carries cyber/privacy liability insurance to protect it against certain losses related to matters of this nature. While this matter may result in remediation expenses, regulatory inquiries, litigation and other liabilities, at this time, the Company does not believe this incident will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial results.",http://www.phiprivacy.net/community-health-systems-says-4-5-million-patients-data-stolen-in-cyber-attack/; http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/08/18/community-health-systems-says-data-stolen-in-cyber-attack/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxbusiness%2Flatest+(Internal+-+Latest+News+-+Text); http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/08/18/chinese-hackers-compromise-4-5-million-patients-data/; http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/18/us-community-health-cybersecurity-idUSKBN0GI16N20140818; http://www.bdtonline.com/news/article_5e7fbcd8-26fd-11e4-a127-0019bb2963f4.html; https://www.trustedsec.com/august-2014/chs-hacked-heartbleed-exclusive-trustedsec/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed; http://www.threatconnect.com/news/threatconnect-enables-healthy-networking-biomed-life-sciences-industry/; http://www.securityinfowatch.com/article/11748224/law-firms-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-community-health-systems-over-massive-data-breach; https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Sample%20letter%20to%20patients_0.pdf

The incident has triggered an angry response from clients who say the email was a serious breach of privacy and eroded the trust of patients who sought confidential psychological help.  Northside Psychology, which has offices in Hawker, Gungahlin and Erindale, admitted a ""serious administrative error"" meant the email addresses of all recipients were included in a message about a mindfulness seminar sent to more than 200 people on Tuesday.   One patient replied to the group email saying they were ""absolutely horrified"" the addresses had been distributed to everyone on the list and it was a ""clear and unacceptable breach"" of the privacy act.   Another male client, who did not want to be identified, said the shared details constituted a ""major breach of privacy"" and an  apology did not make up for the hundreds of names and workplaces that were divulged.  ""The list included all personal email addresses, and for persons employed in the Commonwealth or ACT public service it also included email addresses which pointed to whom they worked for,"" he said.   The business offers counselling and assessment services for matters including anxiety, trauma, sexual abuse, eating disorders, relationship problems, bullying and harassment.  In a follow-up email sent on Thursday, director and principal psychologist Holly Kirwan said staff were liaising with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner about the incident.  ""We accept without question that the sending out of the material in the form that it was sent was a serious administrative error and breach of privacy,"" the email said.  ""I can confirm that steps are being taken to avoid such an error in the future. We are reviewing all relevant policies and procedures and are providing additional training to our staff.     ""We will not send out information of programs or courses or other unsolicited material without your prior consent and none will be sent via email.""  She said staff took clients' privacy very seriously and she was deeply sorry for the error and any distress it caused.   ""A number of you have contacted me directly and I will also respond to each of you individually,"" the email said.  Ms Kirwan was contacted for comment.   Information on the clinic's website stated that confidentiality was paramount and staff adhered to a professional code of ethics and kept treatment and assessment records securely locked.   The male client said his biggest concern was that patients who received the email could pass on the personal information to others.   ""In the case of those that work for ACT or Commonwealth departments this could have the ability to be used for corruption,"" he said.   ""I also have a business which people may not use if they knew I was attending.""  He said protocols to prevent such a mishap should already have been in place given the strict ethical standards the business had to meet.   ""Visiting a psychologist comes with a lot of trust,"" the client said.   ""In this case that has been eroded and may affect the treatment people are receiving.""  The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner would not confirm whether or not it had received any communication or complaints about the incident. However, the office welcomed a federal government proposal to introduce mandatory reporting.  A spokeswoman said organisations were not currently required to report on any privacy breaches under the privacy act.  ""The OAIC believes that the timely notification of a data breach in the right circumstances can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the organisation and the individuals affected by a data breach.""",http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-psychology-clinic-accidentally-reveals-clients-personal-details-in-email-20160115-gm6iob.html

In its lawsuit, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta alleges a corporate audit adviser, who had announced plans to leave the organization, sent protected health information about an unspecified number of patients, as well as other sensitive corporate data, to her personal e-mail account.  The organization operates three hospitals and 20 other facilities that treat children and teenagers in the Atlanta area.  The lawsuit contains no allegations that the former employee, Sharon McCray, used the information for financial fraud or ID theft. It seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent McCray from using or disclosing the information, a court order for McCray to return the information and destroy copies of the data, plus unspecified damages.  A Common Problem Security expert Mac McMillan, CEO of the consulting firm CynergisTek, says this type of insider incident is ""not all that unusual.""  Several studies suggest that a majority of those who leave their jobs take corporate information with them to their new employers, he says. ""What was more alarming, though, was that they felt it was acceptable to do so,"" he adds.  McMillan says organizations can take several steps to prevent insider data breaches. ""First, restrict users' access to the minimal necessary information they need. Second, deploy data loss prevention [technology] that enables you to proactively monitor what users are attempting to transmit and creates an accurate audit trail of what they have sent and where it's gone,"" he says.  DLP technology can enable organizations to set rules for what type of information can be sent to a personal address and the amount of information that can be transmitted in each session - ""rules that, when enforced, can assist you in proactively seeing this type of activity before the information is gone,"" he says.  The Children's Healthcare lawsuit notes that for its employees to access PHI, they must use usernames, passwords and other credentials based on job responsibilities. Individuals who log onto the organization's computer network to access PHI are also logged and tracked, according to the lawsuit.  Lawsuit Details The suit, filed on Oct. 25 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta division, alleges that Sharon McCray misappropriated information ""kept confidential"" by the pediatric healthcare system.  The breached information includes ""highly sensitive and confidential proprietary and trade secret information,"" including pediatric patient health information; numbers assigned to healthcare providers by the Drug Enforcement Agency that allow clinicians to write prescriptions for controlled substances; state license numbers of more than 500 healthcare providers; and attorney-client privileged information, according to the lawsuit.  The pediatric healthcare system alleges that McCray's alleged actions are in violation of a number of federal and Georgia state laws, including trade secret laws and HIPAA, and amounts to computer theft and computer invasion of privacy.  McCray on Oct. 16 announced her resignation effective Dec. 20, according to the suit. On Oct. 18, the organization discovered McCray had sent to her personal e-mail account patient PHI and other information belonging to the health system, the lawsuit alleges.  McCray's alleged e-mailing of information to her personal account started on Oct. 16 and ended on Oct. 21, when Children's Healthcare terminated McCray's access to corporate e-mail and placed her on a paid leave of absence.  During a meeting on Oct. 21 between McCray and her supervisors to discuss the e-mails, the suit alleges, McCray admitted sending the information to her personal e-mail account so that ""she could use the protected information as backup records for her new employment with an unidentified employer to use as a reference.""  Children's Healthcare on Oct. 21 demanded McCray return the information and access to her computer to ensure she was no longer in possession of the protected information, the suit states, and McCray agreed to return the information by end of day Oct. 22.  However, on Oct. 22, McCray sent an e-mail to the organization stating she had only sent the information to herself in order ""to complete job functions"" from home through the end of her employment on Dec. 20. A copy of that e-mail from McCray included in the lawsuit documents says that she ""erred on the side of being over-inclusive so that [McCray] could have the necessary information available to me."" She added that it would take her until at least Oct. 31 to review and return the information to Children's Healthcare. She also asked ""which particular documents"" should be returned.  At that point, Children's Healthcare immediately terminated McCray's employment and demanded return of all the organization's information and documents in her possession and destruction of copies.  Neither Children's Healthcare nor McCray responded to Information Security Media Group's inquiries about whether the information in question had been returned or destroyed by McCray by Oct. 31.  In a statement to Information Security Media Group, a Children's Healthcare spokeswoman said, ""We can confirm that Children's has filed a lawsuit against a former employee for taking confidential and protected health information. The confidentiality of our patients and providers is of the utmost importance, and we are continuing to take every step to protect their information.""  Insider Threats Healthcare organizations should keep in mind that, when it comes to inappropriate access to confidential information, it's not just departing employees that they need to worry about.  For example, a recent case in Florida illustrates how current employees can use patient information to commit fraud.  The Florida Department of Health in Orange County is notifying about 2,000 patients of its health centers about a data security breach. Federal agents investigating a tax fraud scheme discovered that the names, birthdates and Social Security number of patients treated at health department clinics had been inappropriately accessed by two department staffers.  The two workers, who were terminated by the health department, were charged on Oct. 24 with identity theft in the U.S. District Court, Middle District Florida, Orlando Division.  A statement on the department of health's website says: ""The employees have been permanently removed from access to any and all Department of Health information. Medical information, bank account, credit card or other personal information were not part of the breach.""",http://omnibus.healthcareinfosecurity.com/hospital-insider-breach-leads-to-lawsuit-a-6193;http://ef67fc04ce9b132c2b32-8aedd782b7d22cfe0d1146da69a52436.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/hospital-insider-breach-leads-to-lawsuit-eresource-1-a-6193.pdf

A patient sits in the waiting room at his doctor's office, and he can't believe his ears: The doctor is sitting in a consultation room within earshot of the waiting room, listening to phone messages on speakerphone.  ""Everyone in the waiting room could hear everything,"" said Frank Cormier, who recently had this experience in Winnipeg.  He explained that in the voice messages, another doctor named a patient and talked about a diagnosis.  ""I couldn't believe it. My head snapped up,"" Cormier told the CBC News I-Team.  ""You look around and think, 'Am I the only one who thinks this is outrageous?' But I didn't see any response from anyone else.""  That wasn't the end of it, though.  When it was finally Cormier's turn to go see the doctor, it happened again.  ""I was in the [consultation] room, sitting in a chair three feet away from the doctor, whose phone was on the table in front of him, and he was still playing more messages,"" he said.  ""So earlier, doing it with the door open and perhaps not realizing how well it carried into the waiting room is one thing.  But having me sitting there right next to him while he played his messages and made notes  I was stunned.""  ""That, to me, is absolutely unacceptable.""  In his professional life, Cormier is a professor at the University of Manitoba. Part of his work involves reviewing privacy and ethical issues as a member of an ethics board overseeing university research.  Cormier has a message of his own for the physician and everyone else who deals with personal health information: ""Be aware of where they are and what they're saying, and in front of whom they're saying it.""  ""Put yourself in the other person's shoes  How would I feel if it were my name being broadcast about with details of whatever condition I'm suffering from?"" he said.  What can concerned patients do?  Cormier said he didn't lodge any complaints with anyone about the incident.  But there are two places where someone could raise the issue: the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba and the office of the provincial ombudsman.  Neither office has received a formal complaint so far about a privacy breach specifically from health information in voice messages being overheard.  ""It's completely inappropriate and it should not happen,"" said acting provincial ombudsman Mel Holley. ""It does seem to fly in the face of any kind of good common sense.""  Holley added, ""It is an unauthorized disclosure of one person's personal health information to another party who's not authorized to receive it.""  Privacy is protected under the Personal Health Information Act of 1997, which made Manitoba the first province in Canada to pass such a law.  The ombudsman's office did have a case in 2011 that was similar to Cormier's experience.  Holley said a receptionist in a doctor's office was talking too loudly, such that other people waiting in the clinic could hear patients' personal information.  ""We said that's a no-no,"" Holley said.  'It's inappropriate,' says medical college  The sentiment is echoed by Dr. Bill Pope of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba.   ""It's inappropriate,"" Pope said. ""The first thing would be for the patient to identify to the physician how uncomfortable he or she felt.""  Pope added, ""Ask if this is common practice within the office, because often physicians become so involved that they basically don't have time to think about those sorts of things  and they should.""  Pope said the likely reaction of patients in Cormier's situation would be to wonder, ""Does this happen with my information?""  If the college were to get a complaint like Cormier's, Pope said ""one of the registrars would call or write to the physician immediately and say, 'Do you understand that what you're doing is not acceptable? And we expect you to modify or change it.'""  Whether it's a loud receptionist or a doctor playing voice messages on speakerphone, Cormier said he thinks the problem is widespread and needs to stop.

Mr Brown is a former member of the Australian Army (Royal Australian Army Medical Corps) and said he was speaking out because the issue was so important.  Having served for 12 years Im well aware of the importance of the term medical-in-confidence, he said.  I consider the document I picked up very much fitted into that not being observed since it was lying on the side of the street.   I consider there has been an act of gross carelessness or incompetence involved and I think the matter should be addressed.  I dont want anyone to know what I saw.  Mr Brown kept the document secure until Thursday when he was advised the best course of action was to return it by hand to the director of nursing at Wagga Base Hospital.  Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) acting chief executive Jill Ludford has confirmed the document was from the hospital.

According to the provider of health services, attacker(s) hacked into a server and accessed patient and employee data files from St. Joseph Regional Health Center, Burleson St. Joseph Health Center, Madison St. Joseph Health Center, Grimes St. Joseph Health Center and St. Joseph Rehabilitation Center.  The data accessible to attackers included a combination of names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and possibly addresses, the organization said. For the affected patients, medical information was also accessible, and for some employees, bank account information was exposed.  The attackers appeared to be operating from IP addresses in China and elsewhere, the organization said.  As soon as the incident was discovered, SJHS took the affected server offline and launched a thorough forensics investigation with national security and computer forensics experts, a statement explained. The investigation, which is ongoing, confirmed that approximately 405,000 former and current patients', employees' and some employees' beneficiaries' information was accessible to the unauthorized parties.  While it is possible that some information was taken, the forensics investigation has been unable to confirm this, the statement continued. SJHS does not believe any of our former/current patients', employees' or their beneficiaries' information is at further risk because of this incident.

The woman could receive up to $40,000 in compensation after a tribunal found Royal Prince Alfred Hospital breached privacy rules by giving her former husband medical records detailing her serious, chronic illness.  The mother, known for legal reasons as ADJ, and her former husband had equal custody of the children.  But when the father requested copies of the children's medical records, the hospital handed them over without asking for the mother's consent, notifying her or redacting information about her own illness, test results and treatments, which were detailed in the file.  ADJ told the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal her ex-husband had a history of violent behaviour and he used the information released by the hospital to pursue sole custody of the children in the Family Court. She said he disclosed her condition to a number of people, which made her feel ""violated"", and that she had to defend herself publicly from his attacks on her character.  She said she felt ""physically unsafe"" in his presence.  The hospital claimed the information about her medical condition and treatment was relevant to the continuing care of the children, and therefore the health information belonged to all of them simultaneously. Both children were born in the hospital's maternity unit and the files included details of the antenatal care ADJ received and the children's births. The hospital said the strength of the children's rights to their own health information outweighed ADJ's interest in maintaining her privacy.  Tribunal senior member Stephen Montgomery said the information could belong to both a mother and her children simultaneously. In ADJ's case, records show a particular health service was provided to one of the children directly because of ADJ's illness.  Mr Montgomery said information about a mother's illness or hereditary condition could be relevant to the provision of treatment to her children and the same could be said for a father.  But ADJ argued that mothers were unique in that while their medical information formed part of their children's files, potentially equally valuable health information about the father or other relatives remained solely in their files, inaccessible to the child or the mother.  In ruling the hospital had breached health privacy laws, Mr Montgomery said some of ADJ's information included on the children's records was neither relevant nor necessary for their care and treatment. There was no evidence to establish why some tests the mother had had were relevant to the children's treatment and ""should not have been released"".  Mr Montgomery also found that by retaining the mother's health details on the children's records, the hospital failed to ensure the security of her information against unauthorised use and disclosure  The matter will return to the tribunal next month for submissions on ADJ's case for damages. The tribunal can order the hospital to pay compensation of up to $40,000.",http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hospital-breached-privacy-rules-by-releasing-womans-details-to-exhusband-20140911-10erxy.html

Of the 9,000 people whose information was on the flash drive, 3,300 staff with surnames starting with letters P-Z had social insurance numbers included in the information spreadsheet.  The remaining 5,700 employees had their names and employee numbers breached.

Lost, not stolen  The USB drive was last used on June 17 in an office within Eastern Health's human resources department, and was reported missing two days later.   Diamond said they believe the USB is lost and not stolen, adding there is nothing to suggest that the information on the USB drive will be used for a fraudulent purpose.  Employees can access credit reports free-of-charge, the news release said.  Following the breach, Eastern Health said it plans to ""upgrade its anti-virus platform so that USB drives will be automatically encrypted before use.""

Markitta Washington, 29, of Hampton, Georgia, previously of Farmington Hills, and Martez Lear, 29, of Farmington Hills were indicted on multiple counts of identity theft crimes, the U.S. Attorneys Office said Tuesday.  Washington, a former employee of Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital and DMC Harper Hospital, allegedly took patient records and used the information to file false tax returns in other peoples names, according to Barbara L. McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District.  During a search of the home Washington and Lear shared, authorities recovered the personal information of 1,400 people, including names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. Authorities also recovered re-encoded credit cards and gifts cards.  Washington and Lear are accused of filing false tax returns with the information of at least 305 victims during tax years 2011 and 2012, receiving about $489,000. Most of the refunds were received through prepaid debit cards, officials said.  On Tuesday, officials with both hospitals said they were providing credit protection and monitoring for affected patients.  We take very seriously the misuse of patient information, said David Olejarz, spokesman for Henry Ford Health System. The conduct of this former worker does not reflect the integrity and honesty of our more than 23,000 employees.  Olejarz said the information theft was limited to 141 patients who received inpatient neurology or outpatient radiology care at Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital between Jan. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2013. He said the hospital has taken increased security precautions, although he did not elaborate.  DMC Harper University Hospital officials were made aware of the allegations in March, said Sarah Collica, spokeswoman for the hospital.  The hospital conducted an internal review and immediately revoked Washingtons access to the computer systems, officials said.  The entire Detroit Medical Center takes the protection of its patients personal information very seriously, Melanie Moss, spokeswoman for DMC-Harper University Hospital, said in a statement Tuesday. Security of that information is paramount and medical center officials say they deeply regret that this situation has occurred.  The majority of identity theft occurs inside of institutions such as businesses, government agencies and hospitals, said Robert Siciliano, an identity theft expert with bestIDtheftcompanys.com.  Those that have access to the data are the most likely to have access to the crime, he said.  Siciliano advises that everyone pay for credit monitoring.  There are things (the hospitals) can do, Siciliano said. In the end, when you put people in a position of trust, youre hoping you can trust them. Theres no such thing as 100 percent security.  Washington was arrested in Georgia and will be arraigned in the Eastern District of Michigan. Lear is serving a sentence in a Michigan prison for gun-related charges.  Criminals should know that while technology has made it easier than ever for them to commit identify fraud, technology is also making it easier for law enforcement to catch them, McQuade said in a statement. We are making enforcement of identity theft a high priority because this crime has become so pervasive and can be so damaging to victims.

Now two months later, nearly 180 patients possibly affected are just finding out. One of them came to FOX 7 for help.  It was inside a locked storage area at Seton Northwest Hospital where a device was stolen.  We're told only names, dates of birth, and Seton account numbers were on it.  A patient came to us in tears fearing this could lead to a much larger problem, identity theft.  When Brenda Falls received a letter from Seton Healthcare, she never expected to read this, ""I see that my privacy and confidentiality has been broken.""  It was on February 28 when staff discovered that a Hewlett Packard desktop device had been stolen from the Seton Northwest Sleep Lab. Almost two months later, Falls was notified.  ""It really did frighten me because I mean, that's two months that someone could have been stealing my identity. There's no telling what it was,"" Falls said.  Seton says the device is used to capture and manipulate data from sleep studies, it does not function like a normal computer. The operator would need a password and access to Seton systems to get a hold of patient data. Data that we're told only consists of names, dates of birth and Seton account numbers.  Falls believes that's enough to cause harm.  ""We don't know who has this and we don't know what they're going to do with it. We need to arm ourselves now and protect ourselves because if we don't do it, nobody else is going to do it for us,"" Falls said.  In response Seton Healthcare sent the following statement:  ""But to be safe, Seton already has offered, at no cost to patients, ID protection for a year to all the 180 or so patients whose information we believe is on this data storage device. Seton is sincerely sorry that this incident occurred and plans to work closely with the patients involved to protect them from harm.""  ""I think I would feel more secure if this was much longer than a year because anything can happen. A lot of things can happen even after a year,"" Falls said.  This isn't the first time for Seton to be in this type of situation. In October, a laptop computer was stolen from the Seton McCarthy Clinic. Nearly 5,500 people may have been affected and the device carried more data; including social security numbers, addresses, and insurance information.  Falls says she wants more to be done.  ""First of all making sure this does not happen again and I think Seton needs to step up to the plate,"" Falls said.  When it comes to making changes, in October the public was told, ""Seton has taken steps to reduce the possibility of this happening again.""  In this most recent case, the public was once again told, ""Seton has taken steps to reduce the possibility of this happening again.""

The purpose of this notice is to identify a recent incident involving the theft of a computer laptop belonging to one of our employees. The laptop contained very limited information about current and former clients: specifically, the first and last name and, in some cases, potential diagnoses. The laptop did not contain any other identifying information, such as Social Security numbers or dates of birth, which could be used by an identity thief to financially exploit our clients. Although the laptop did contain the names of approximately 4,500 current and former clients of UniHealth SOURCE, UniHealth Select, and Blue Ridge Community Based Services, the level of financial risk to these individuals appears to be very low.  On October 8, 2013, the employees laptop was stolen from her car at her home. The theft was reported to the police, and we continue to cooperate fully with the investigation. The computer laptop was used by the employee to access and maintain certain patient information for the purpose of quality assurance audits for health care services provided by the above-referenced offices.

This past summer, hospital officials noticed that an employee in the records department had illegally obtained and was in possession of a patients medical file. Hospital Administrator John Halfen said Thursday that the employee, Cherie LaBraque, was fired within hours of the discovery, but the ramifications of the theft are far-reaching. The patient whose records were stolen, Tami Matteson, addressed the Northern Inyo Hospital Board in open session Wednesday evening, testifying that the breach in confidentiality has shaken her faith in the local healthcare system and she may have to move out of the community. My entire medical record was reviewed  possibly copied and disseminated and discussed with who knows who all  and held by a Northern Inyo Hospital employee, Matteson said. Inyo County District Attorney Tom Hardy said Friday morning that his office is aware of the matter and is conducting its own investigation. Due to the ongoing investigation, Hardy said he could not comment on the specifics of the case, but he did point out that the illegal or unauthorized access of private medical files could be a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. In general, Hardy said, HIPPA is one of those very complicated laws that could result in civil or criminal charges, or both. Matteson has said that her medical files were used in an attempt to document that she is an unfit mother while she was engaged in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband, who is now married to LaBraque. This has put me through horrible things. Its embarrassing and horrifying, Matteson said. She went into other peoples records too. I will never know what she did with the records or who she showed them to. According to Halfen, an investigation conducted by the hospital revealed that LaBraque had accessed Mattesons file a total of 14 times. The first 13 breaches occurred over a two-day period in 2010. At that time, she did write letters to the court during the custody battle, Matteson said. In early August of this year, LaBraques supervisor, Kelli Huntsinger, noticed a hard copy of Mattesons records on LaBraques desk. Halfen said Huntsinger was aware of the personal dispute between the employee and the patient, and immediately questioned LaBraque as to why she would have that file. Halfen explained that LaBraque was fired within hours of Huntsinger discovering that she was in possession of files that she had no legal business to have. We were able to determine that a breach did take place, Halfen said, adding that the Hospital Board has determined that NIH as an organization is not at fault, as LaBraque received the necessary HIPPA training and was aware of procedures and protocols that are set forth to protect patients rights. What happened is, we had a corporately trained and trusted employee (in the hospital records department) who took advantage of that trust and accessed protected health information, Halfen said. He added that LaBraque was required to complete three MediCon courses and pass a three-part exam every year to ensure that she was up to speed on HIPPA and patient confidentiality laws. Every employee is aware of their responsibilities and the hospital can only do so much in the case of a rogue employee, Halfen said. The hospital board offered Matteson a settlement on her claim in closed session at Wednesdays meeting. However, Matteson was not permitted to address the board during its closed session meeting, due to Brown Act laws. Halfen said that Matteson did not specify a dollar amount to settle her claim against the hospital, but the board didnt think it was right to do nothing. NIH has reported the breach and Mattesons claim to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. That agency has the ability to open its own investigation into the breach and, if it finds the hospital is at fault, can fine NIH. Halfen said that, as of Thursday, the CMS had not taken steps to reprimand the hospital. They are typically understanding of individual cases and it isnt likely that the hospital will face fines, Halfen said. According to Halfen, hospital officials have taken the breach seriously. Weve already had a session or two of counseling for the folks in that department to ensure that there is no question that the staff has been properly trained. If anything, there is probably going to be a little over-reaction to this in that department. Which is OK. Halfen added that one other resident, Lauren Nitschke, a friend of Mattesons, had her medical records unlawfully accessed by LaBraque. This information has been very upsetting, Nitschke said Thursday, adding that she and her husband both feel extremely violated and have a number of serious concerns regarding our privacy and future healthcare. Halfen stressed that the breaches of confidentiality were the work of one rogue employee who has been terminated. The hospital has 400 employees. This breach took place in 2010. We have had 600-700 employees since that time. This was one employee. That doesnt equate to a systematic problem at the hospital, Halfen said. He added that it was proper oversight on the part of the Records Department manager that caught the breach in the first place. Its important that the community trust the hospital, Halfen said. Thats why we have these HIPPA laws. We have a computer system that tells us who got into what files, the time and date and what they did. If anyone feels their medical files may have been accessed, we can check. The only thing is, we need to know to look. Halfen said anyone who is concerned about their medical files is encouraged to contact the NIH Records Department. Staff there has the ability to find out if their files were also illegally accessed.",http://www.inyoregister.com/node/5176

Dr. John Kinahan is being investigated by the Vancouver Island Heath Authority — and a third-party lawyer specializing in labour, employment and human rights — for an alleged privacy breach.  The urologist maintains his hospital privileges. Kinahan was operating Thursday and did not return calls for comment. The nurse who apparently first received the image did not respond to an email request for comment. The B.C. Nurses Union notes that a patient privacy breach is a serious allegation, and it is awaiting the outcome of VIHA’s investigation before commenting.  The alleged privacy breach occurred July 4 at Royal Jubilee Hospital. It was reported to VIHA’s information stewardship, access and privacy department the next day.  “We were made aware on July 5 a physician with hospital privileges was alleged to have taken a photo of a patient and sent it to parties that had no direct care relationship with the patient or appeared to not to have a direct relationship with the parties,” said VIHA spokeswoman Suzanne Germain.  The morbidly obese patient was unconscious and in the intensive-care unit following a procedure when the doctor allegedly photographed him with his cellphone and sent the picture to a friend, who may have forwarded it to others.  “We take the privacy and confidentiality of our patients extremely seriously,” Germain said. “We can confirm that an investigation is underway into an alleged privacy breach that occurred at Royal Jubilee Hospital.”  VIHA did not immediately inform the patient of the alleged breach because it said the patient was very sick, it did not have full facts and information.” In a privacy breach situation, VIHA said its first mandate is to stop the spread of the breach.  But when the investigation became public Wednesday and VIHA received requests from patients concerned they were the subjects of the photographs, VIHA contacted the patient and his family.  The doctor talked to the patient about the incident, VIHA said.  The three-week-old investigation is in its “fact-finding stage.” The College of Physicians and Surgeons said it is aware of the alleged patient privacy breach but is not investigating as it has no first-hand information about the alleged incident.  Generally speaking the college would be very critical of a patient privacy breach, spokeswoman Susan Prins said.  If VIHA determines the patient’s privacy rights were violated, the health authority could review the hospital privileges of the doctor — an independent contractor. The college is the authority that issues discipline.  VIHA officials would not comment on whether the physician has been investigated by the health authority before.  But this is not the first time that such an privacy breach has occurred in VIHA. A doctor at Cowichan District Hospital was accused of a similar breach earlier this year.  Despite protections and policies in place related to patient privacy and confidentiality, earlier this year, before either incident, VIHA began developing a new policy around photographing, videotaping and audio recording in VIHA service areas in part because of the rapidly changing technology for handheld devices.",http://www.theprovince.com/health/Victoria+doctor+under+fire+over+alleged+breach+privacy/8709571/story.html

The spreadsheet included patient names, health insurance payors, dates of admission and discharge, a one-word description of the medical service department from which the patient received services, and patient Medical Center account number. This e-mail did not include any patient social security numbers, dates of birth, any credit card or banking information, health insurance identification numbers, or patient addresses.  The unintended recipient informed the Medical Center of the mistake on the same day that the email was sent. The Medical Center attempted to obtain official confirmation that the email was completely deleted and the information was not further disclosed. Unfortunately, such confirmation has not yet been received. Accordingly, while the Medical Center has no evidence that any personal information has been misused in any way, we have notified affected patients by mail and have offered free identity monitoring services.  The Medical Center is currently reviewing its e-mailing policies and technological processes, and is retraining staff to minimize the chance of other such incidents. The Jersey City Medical Center sincerely regrets this unfortunate incident because we consider the security of patient information to be of the utmost importance.

The womans story is extreme, but her experience is an example of how her privacy was violated and her medical data breached. Both crimes, which are on the rise, can lead to identity theft or to misuse of information by health insurance companies, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the San Diego-based World Privacy Forum.  The employee disclosed sensitive information about the patient inappropriately and then when the photograph was posted online and went viral, that constituted a data breach, Dixon said.

The company, which was providing human resources services to nine trusts in Liverpool until last year, mistakenly sent details of staff at other Merseyside trusts to Liverpool Community Health Trust's HR department.  The trusts in the ""Merseyside consortium"" transferred payroll and recruitment services to Capita HR Solutions in 2012.  However, the contracts were terminated last year following claims of problems with staff payments and recruitment delays.  In November one of the organisations in the consortium, Mersey Care Trust, revealed in its board papers that ""information governance issues"" had been uncovered when the services were taken back in house.  According to the papers, Capita was involved in a ""potential breach"" relating to a ""number of local NHS organisations"".  The Walton Centre Foundation Trust coordinated the response to the breach on behalf of the consortium.  A trust spokeswoman said the consortium was ""aware of a possible issue relating to the handling by an external supplier of some of our staff data"".  ""Our concerns focus on the possibility that this supplier may have incorrectly shared details of some staff employed by say consortium member 'x', their employer, with consortium member 'y', who does not employ them.""  She said the concerns had been reported to the Information Commissioner's office and that the consortium's own investigations are ongoing.  ""We will continue to work with regulators, the supplier in question, staff side representatives and others to resolve this important matter to the satisfaction of all concerned,"" she added.

Bosses at the Latham House Medical Practice in Melton have apologised after up to 200 child flu vaccination consent forms were sent out to the wrong addresses.  These forms gave the child's name, date of birth, full address, registered GP and Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) number.  Latham House Medical Practice manager Alison Hipkin said she was not sure how many forms had been sent to the wrong addresses.  She said: ""We do not know if six, 16 or 60 or more forms went to the wrong addresses.  ""It was down to human error and we apologise to the parents concerned.""  The error was spotted after parents in the town started receiving letters with consent forms containing details of other people's children.  Mum-of-five Kim Hendy, of Drummond Walk, Melton, said she received a letter about the flu vaccination on Saturday October 10.  She said: ""There was a standard letter about the consent form and another sheet of paper which was the consent form.  ""When I looked at the consent form it had the details of someone else's child on.  ""I could not believe it. Luckily I knew the other mum and was able to warn her.  ""What worries me most is who has got the details of my child and other children too.  ""There are lots of undesirable people out there. If this sort of information - the name of a child, their age, their address, gets into their hands, knows what might happen.  ""You read about children being snatched. it is very, very worrying.  ""They might apologise but I still do not know who got my child's personal information and what they have down with it.""  A spokesperson for the practice said: ""It was brought to our attention this Monday that an administrative error occurred whilst sending out flu immunisation letters to a few households in Melton.  "" Invitation letters were sent to parents/guardians of children between the ages of two and four offering them a seasonal flu immunisation.  ""Whilst the letters have gone out to the correct patients, we have since been informed that the consent forms, in some instances, have been attached to the wrong letters.  ""This has been fully investigated and reported to the correct authorities.  ""The staff members have been informed of the error and all appropriate actions have been taken by the Practice to prevent a repeat of this incident.  ""The breach of confidentiality is regarding the child's name, address and date of birth. No medical information has been disclosed.  ""Any breach of data security will always be taken seriously by the Practice and we have mailed out apology letters to patients who might have been affected by this administrative error.""  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which upholds information rights, said no complaints about the Melton practice had been received.  An ICO spokesperson said: ""If people feel their information has not been processed in line with the law, they should take this up with the organisation in question.

The ransomware demanded monetary payment from Cove Medicine in order to decrypt the files and allow the practice to regain access to them. The encrypted medical records contained patient information, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, patient identification numbers, prescription information, diagnosis information, procedure information, and time and date of treatment.  Cove Medicine did not pay the ransom to the cyber criminals, but instead removed the virus by reinstalling the operating system on its server and then restoring the majority of its patient records from backup copies. The backup records, however, were partially encrypted as well and the practice currently has not been able to restore its internal notes for visits that have occurred in approximately the past two years. Cove Medicine believes it will be able to restore all other treatment records, and that this will not impair its ability to provide care to its patients. Subsequent scans of the practice’s computer system have shown no additional indications of the ransomware.

Reberry said the glitch occurred among patients who had several accounts that the new computer system did not link. She said patients may have made payments that were credited to one account. That account may have had a credit, but the computer did not transfer any of the payment to other accounts, which then became delinquent. Board President Larry Purcell said when the accounts reached the 120-day overdue mark, the computer automatically sent them to the collection agency, which then sent out notices to the account holders. No one at the medical center noticed, he said, due to the delays involved in submitting claims to the insurance companies during the changeover of the computer system. Reberry said the hospital had not turned anyone over to the collection agency for 15 months. The hospital became aware of the problem when patients began calling, he said, adding about 200 calls per day were received. He said most people were OK when they learned about the situation and that the medical center would take care of it. Purcell said, ""It was better that there were a lot (of accounts)"" as the problem ""became glaringly obvious quickly. If it had been a small number, bureaucratic paperwork would have buried them."" The hospital ""decided to take the high road,"" he said, advertised the problem and asked people to call. ""People are calling, and we are fixing it,"" he said. ""We made sure as they phoned in that they were pulled back from the collection agency, and we're making sure no one is turned over to the credit bureau."" Reberry said different processes are in place now ""to check across the whole continuum"" so the problem does not recur, and additional resources are in place to answer phones. ""We've added a position so we can address concerns,"" Reberry said.

Michelle McEwen, Speare Memorial Hospitals president and CEO, said the company immediately began the process to identify the extent of information on the computer and last week sent a letter of notification to the patients affected by the potential breach.  Hospital spokeswoman Michele Hutchins said letters went out to 5,994 patients.  The laptops contents did not include Social Security numbers, credit card information or insurance carriers, Hutchins said, except for one patients file whose Social Security number was present. That patient has been notified, she said.   The protected health information on the computer included patient names, and in some instances, patient addresses, hospital account numbers, medical record numbers, physician names, dates of service, procedure codes, and diagnosis codes.  The letters took so long to send because the (Information-Technology) Department needed to find out what was on the computer and that took some time, Hutchins said.  What we are advising patients to do is monitor billing statements, she said.   The laptop was in a parked and locked private vehicle in Boston.   It was a random act, Hutchins said. The person was most likely interested in the hardware. But, she said, the hospital cannot assume the information was deleted or discarded.   Boston police were also notified and are investigating the theft, said Hutchins.  She said the hospital will also monitor  for any indication of misuse of information.  Its unfortunate that this happened, Hutchins said. We have taken multiple steps to ensure that this doesnt happen again.  The computer was password-protected, however that does not provide complete security from unauthorized access, she said.  McEwen said the hospital has hired experts to assist in identifying additional safeguards that could strengthen current security protocols.

The paper records found at the city recycling area near the Orange Dome in Winter Haven on Tuesday came from the office of Jeffry Barnes, a Winter Haven periodontist who practices at 320 Ave. K S.E.  Social Security numbers are the most vital element of identity theft, and some of the patients are peeved.  The material from Barnes' office were in a recycling bin and contained more than 60 prescription reports, with the names of the patient and drugs prescribed by Barnes. Among the paperwork were medical history forms that include what drugs patients were taking and whether patients were seeing a psychiatrist.  Barnes said he feels terrible about the breach of sensitive information and said it was in part the mistake of an employee who otherwise has a long and stellar service record.  Barnes said the blunder was inadvertent, but he acknowledged it was in violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, (HIPAA), which mandates health care providers to safeguard personal health information.  Barnes faces the possibility of sanctions from the federal government's HIPAA enforcement arm. He could be fined.  Barnes said his office went virtually paperless in 2007. But new patients are still required to fill out ""welcome"" forms, complete with Social Security numbers, driver license numbers, addresses and phone numbers.  Barnes said the forms are scanned into the office computer system, and the paperwork gets put in a box, usually with the word ""SHRED"" on its side.  When the box gets full, workers call Crown Shredding to come and destroy the contents. That shredding is routinely done in the parking lot so customers can watch if they so choose.  But what happened this time, Barnes said, is someone from his office put magazines and newspapers on top of the records in the box slated for shredding. Barnes said none of his office workers will own up to doing that.  He said that on Monday the box was taken to the recycling center by another worker and dumped into the recycling container.  That woman has quit her job, Barnes said Friday. He said the woman has worked there and done a great job for at least a dozen years.  He said the resignation was by no means forced. ""I've tried to call her to get her come back, but she won't answer her phone.

""We were alerted that a business person had been receiving faxes on a number that used to belong to a family physician,"" said John Gillis of Capital District Health Authority.  The doctor had retired but the fax number remained in the laboratory database at Capital Health.  The database automatically distributed lab test results to the number which had been reassigned to a business woman.  ""Much to her surprise she received patient information over the fax number,"" said Dr. Gus Grant, registrar and CEO of the Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons.  The business woman contacted the college and Capital Health in September to tell them about the situation.  The college began investigating and discovered  under Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission rules  business numbers are automatically put back into circulation after one year.  ""Fax numbers and phone numbers live on. We have an obligation to stay current on our information and that includes contact information,"" said Grant.  Capital Health updated its lab data base and issued a reminder throughout its system about this case.  The college has issued a similar directive, warning doctors not to rely on old printed copies of its physicians' listing.  It also said retiring doctors or those changing fax numbers must tell colleagues and institutions.  The college discontinued its printed physician directory in 2009 over privacy concerns.  ""Clearly the aged telephone book that sits in a drawer in a clinic is a dangerous source of information,"" said Grant.  Sarah Levy-MacLeod, a spokesperson for Bell Aliant, said the phone company's practice is to retire business numbers for the one year maximum allowed.  ""After that, the numbers go back into our automated system and are available to customers,"" said Levy-MacLeod.

On Nov. 5, 2013, it was discovered that a Coulee Medical Center employed physician had shared certain patient information with his wife. The information shared includes: patient account number (a number used solely by the hospital for purposes of identification), date of service, CPT code and description of health care services that the patient received at Coulee Medical Center. The information that was accessed may have, in some instances, also included the patients name.  Coulee Medical Center has taken measures to prevent further access to this information. Coulee Medical Center is committed to providing quality care and protecting patients  personal information, and apologizes for the inconvenience and concern this may be for affected patients.  The affected patients will receive direct mail correspondence from Coulee Medical Center. If you have questions about this incident or concerns about how it may impact you, please contact the Coulee Medical Center Privacy Officer at (509) 633-1753.  Although I havent yet found a copy of the actual notification letter mailed to patients, at least one recipient was not appreciative at all. And the doctor in question, who reportedly was not named in the letter sent to patients, publicly responded and indicated that he felt the medical center had unfairly tarnished his reputation:  In an interview, Dr. Andrew Castrodale said the HIPAA notice, made under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, implied the work had been about figuring out bonus pay, but was actually meant to devise a reliable tool for measuring and reporting the efficiency and productivity of health care providers at Coulee Medical Center.  Although it did not name Castrodale, the Notice of Patient Privacy Breach that arrived in mailboxes Jan. 3 and 4 said the doctor had improperly shared patient information with his wife.  Castrodale said his wife, Sherril, is an actuary, and was helping him build a standardized statistical tool that could be used by Coulee Medical Center.  None of this has to do with anyones medical history, he said.  I find it somewhat shocking that a physician would suggest that PHI that includes CPT codes, description of services, and in some cases, patients names, is not covered by HIPAA or that this was not a big deal  particularly in a small town where people might be recognized by unusual conditions or services.  In any event, unless the physician wishes to claim that PHI is not PHI, it seems hat the doctor shared patients PHI with his wife without authorization or consent of the patients. However noble his intentions, and however much he believes the medical center may have misrepresented his motivation, unless he had consent or a HIPAA waiver, I think its pretty clear he did violate HIPAAs Privacy Rule.  That said, was the hospitals notification accurate and appropriate? Did they have an obligation to explain to recipients that the disclosure to the doctors wife was reportedly so she could provide actuarial advice? Was this, as some of have suggested, a political dirty trick to discredit the doctor? The incident wound up contributing to the medical center hiring new legal counsel:  A majority of hospital district commissioners voted Thursday to immediately hire new legal counsel, then went into closed session with the new attorney.  Commissioner Jerry Kennedy said the boards reasons for changing attorneys had been compounded the week before when the hospital administration mailed a notice of a privacy breach, reportedly to thousands, saying a doctor had violated federal patient privacy rules.  One of the hopes that I had was that  having legal counsel involved in that would help minimize reputational damage to the institution and to staff that might be potentially involved, Kennedy said. I didnt feel, as a lot of people didnt feel, that that happened.  The HIPAA notice, made under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, came at a time when the hospital administration has been at seemingly irreconcilable odds with its doctors, who have expressed no confidence in administration.  So how does a political controversy factor into a HIPAA breach notification? It shouldnt, of course, and if the medical center did not give patients the information they needed to assess their risk of harm because of any secondary or political agenda, then thats problematic.  Id love to see what HHS does with this one if they get all the facts.  But this is also a useful reminder of why covered entities should consult with lawyers and experts on breach response before making any statements or sending out any notification letters.",http://www.phiprivacy.net/required-hipaa-breach-notification-or-political-dirty-trick/; http://cmccares.org/patient-privacy-notice44

In this instance, only a limited amount of data was exposed. No financial information, insurance details, health data or Social Security numbers were compromised in the incident.  The privacy violation was caused by a data error, according to a statement issued by the hospital. Howard Hospital's Faculty Practice Plan had contracted two companies to  California Healthcare Medical Billing, Inc. and JP Recovery Services, Inc.  to send notification letters to patients advising them that their medical bills had not been paid.  The letters were sent to individuals as instructed; however a data error resulted in patients sharing the same surnames being sent letters intended for other recipients. In total 1,445 letters were sent to incorrect individuals.  The university has reviewed the incident and will be taking steps to prevent similar privacy breaches occurring in the future.  This breach may cause some confusion and annoyance among patients, but due to the limited data exposed, it is unlikely that affected individuals will suffer any harm, loss or damage. The same cannot be said for the university.  Personally Identifiable Information  patient names  were exposed along with data classed as Protected Health Information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The HIPAA Privacy Rule covers data relating to the provision of healthcare to an individual as well as past, present and future payments for the provision of healthcare. The HIPAA mailing therefore breaches the HIPAA Privacy Rule.  HIPAA Rules demand that breach notification letter are sent to all patients within 60 days of discovery of the breach. The mailing went out on May 6, 2015 and the university first started hearing of the mailing error on May 11, 2015. According to a Friday report in the Washington Post, the university ""will individually notify all of the affected patients,"" suggesting the notification letters have not yet been sent; a potential violation of the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.  Delaying breach notifications unnecessarily and sending letters after the HIPAA deadline invites OCR attention and couple potentially result in a financial penalty. Covered entities are advised to act decisively and promptly if they discover a data breach, and should aim to issue breach notification letters well before the HIPAA deadline.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/mailing-error-causes-howard-university-privacy-breach-7021/

After a six-day trial in Sedgwick County court, a jury found April Galvan, 54, guilty Monday on all seven counts of computer fraud.  On the morning she was fired from Cypress Surgery Center, 9300 E. 29th St. North, Galvan sent the e-mails to a Gmail account.  Were not here as any kind of witch hunt, picking on poor April Galvan or trying to make her life harder than it is, said Robert Short, chief attorney of the economic crimes unit for the Sedgwick County District Attorneys Office. We are here because she made a decision that day and the responsibility for that decision.  By 11:30 a.m. on June 12, 2013, Galvan had been fired. In expectation of that action, prosecutors said, Galvan sent approximately 140 e-mails from her work computer to her personal Gmail account between 7:06 and 10:04 a.m. that day. Others were sent in the days leading up to June 12, a total of 168 e-mails with personal information for 317 patients.  The e-mails included sensitive health information for 198 patients. Seven e-mails in particular had attachments that had confidential patient information. Those seven e-mails were at the heart of the case against Galvan.  Rocky Wiechman, a criminal defense attorney for Galvan, argued that Galvan didnt deliberately send those seven e-mails as she rapidly forwarded e-mails the morning she was fired.  Short said she well knew she lacked authority over the e-mails and patient information.  If you get mad when you get fired, you cant bust up the equipment, you cant steal a generator from the warehouse, you cant take money out of the register, you cant bust out the window on the way out, Short said to the jury. All those things would be considered a crime. So what makes April Galvan think she can go in and data mine all this information and put it in her personal e-mail?  Cypress Surgery Center discovered the mass e-mail transfer in an audit shortly after Galvans termination.  Galvan testified that she worked from home periodically during her tenure at Cypress Surgery Center and to do so, she sent e-mails to her personal e-mail account that sometimes included confidential patient information.  But closer to her termination, Galvan said, she had an inkling she might be fired. Fearing legal backlash from Cypress about an incident that involved fraudulent insurance billing, she said, she forwarded the e-mails from her work account to her personal account to protect herself.  That was no longer about taking work home and 60-hour workweeks and being a dedicated employee, Short said to Galvan during cross-examination.  Instead, Short said, she took those e-mails for a personal reason  to protect herself.  By the 11th, now you had started saying, OK, I see the train coming, Im going to start taking these e-mails and start shipping them to my Gmail account, is that right? Short asked Galvan.  She responded, Yes.  Higher level of secrecy  Cypress Surgery Center houses facilities for at least 10 medical specialties, including infertility treatment.  David Grainger, a reproductive endocrinologist at Cypress Surgery Center, said 198 of the patients who had sensitive information released were men and women who were involved in in vitro fertilization. He said even though all medical records are sensitive, these in vitro fertilization records rise to another level.  So much of the information people are seeking from us, they dont even share with their families; forget about friends, Grainger said. Its a very emotionally sensitive area of medicine. I would say one of the most sensitive.  For men, Grainger said, it is an issue of masculinity. And women, he said, become terribly critical of their bodies when theyre not performing like they should.  During his testimony, Grainger looked at the jury and said, citing statistics, that probably three of the people in the jury have experienced infertility personally, and everyone probably knows someone whose experienced infertility, because its that common.  The procedures often go against the doctrine of some patients churches, he said, adding that the breach of that information could be traumatic to them.  Grainger said that in the wake of Galvans firing, the surgery center sent a letter to the 317 patients affected by the e-mail release.  The arguments  Galvans justification for the e-mail transfer fell largely under two points. The first, she said, was that she had permission to send e-mails, even with patient information, to her personal account in order to work from home.  The second was that because she had to sign off on that work and because her name was attached to it, she needed to take that information to prove its validity.  Galvan said she knowingly forwarded those e-mails rather than downloading them on a hard drive or printing them in an effort to be transparent.  In her mind, she believed in good faith that she had that authorization, said Wiechman, Galvans attorney. And she didnt do it sneakily, she didnt do it under cover of darkness, she did it openly.  He emphasized that only 4.2 percent of the total emails sent contained patient health information. Wiechman also used excerpts from the employee handbook to support his case about Galvans authorization to access the patient information.  But Short, the prosecutor, said thats irrational reliance on an employee handbook.  Of course its not in here, he said. Theres not a subsection titled What to do the day you get fired and what you cant do on that day. How would Symbion be able to guess that shes going to go in and grab that information and then put a rule in here saying you cant do that?  He said the kind of handbook Wiechman is referring to would be 800 volumes, and it still wouldnt cover everything.  Avery Elofsson, assistant district attorney, used the analogy of taking physical property from Cypress.  I bet you the doctors office wishes it had been the cash box, he said. The money you can replace. The personal, private information  thats gone, and they dont know what happened to it. ",http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article27985777.html

Additionally, Quraishi told police he was unable to immediately provide any of the names of the patients whose records were stolen from the shed.

The letter, which Health Canada says was sent to 40,000 people, comes in a white envelope, and has a return address with the words Medical Marihuana Access Program written across the top, followed by the patients name and address. Many people say their privacy has been violated and fear their houses may be robbed and their home growing gardens targeted.  Im outright panicked, said Multiple Sclerosis patient Suzi Berardini, who also suffers from trigeminal neuralgia. She said the mailman who dropped the letter off smirked when he handed her the envelope. Its terrifying. So many levels of terrifying.  Laurie MacEachern, who represents medical marijuana patients as director of the Medicinal Cannabis Patients Alliance of Canada Inc. said she is supremely concerned about the information being released to the public.  One patient said she got her mail and the delivery man said, I didnt know you smoked, said MacEachern.  MacEachern said previous letters did not have the word marijuana on it. Almost a dozen other medical marijuana patients called Metro with similar concerns. Most werent willing to comment on the record for fear of being exposed even more.  Health Canada Deputy Minister George Da Pont said the format of the mailing was the result of an administrative error. He said the letters outlining changes to the Marihuana Medical Access Program, which take effect next spring, were sent to 40,000 patients.  This is not standard Health Canada practice, he wrote in an email to Metro. On behalf of Health Canada, I deeply regret this administrative error. Health Canada is taking steps to ensure this does not happen again. Protection of personal information is of fundamental importance to Health Canada. We are in discussion with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.  Among the reasons for changes to the rules, which will prohibit patients from growing their own marijuana at home, cited in the letter is concern that participants in the program will be targets of home invasions.  A spokesperson with the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner Heather Ormerod said in an email:  Our Office was not notified by Health Canada of this incident. We were made aware of it by a number of concerned individuals who contacted our Office. We have since received complaints and we will be investigating this matter, Omerod wrote. We have been in touch with Health Canada and are currently gathering further information.  Why people say they are upset: Suzi Beradini says she no longer feels safe in her Ottawa home after a letter from Health Canada exposed her as a medical marijuana patient.  Any Joe Blow who works at Canada Post now might know where I am and that Im a patient and can easily think, well, if shes a legal patient, she must have meds, she told Metro after receiving a letter.  I feel like a I have a giant bullseye on my roof.  Rick Gauthier is now considering moving from his small town in Quebec, as he says everybody likely knows he is a medical marijuana user after receiving his letter in the mail Thursday.  I think Im unsafe now.  He worries Canada Post workers may even steal his medicine.  Michael Greenblatts letter went through several hands before it was delivered to his room at a nursing home in Markham. When the letter finally reached his room, he said the delivery person said,  I would sure like to be in this program.   First of all, its my private medical issue, Greenblatt said.

It contained the names and email addresses of patients who had attended HIV clinics at Dean Street, which is part of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.  Alan McOwan, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital trust's director for sexual health, said the mistake was realised ""within minutes"" and every patient was being contacted individually.  He said: ""A member of staff who usually sends out the monthly email pasted the email addresses into the CC bit of the box rather than the blind CC bit.  ""The member of staff is clearly devastated by what happened.""  An internal investigation had been launched and all mass emails to patients have been stopped, he said.  He said it was not accurate to say every patient on the list was HIV positive.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the breach as ""completely unacceptable"".  Speaking at the NHS Innovation Expo conference in Manchester, he said patients needed to have confidence that the NHS would look after personal data.  ""The truth is that we will throw this all away if we lose the public's trust in our ability to look after their personal data securely,"" he said.  ""Nothing matters more to us than our own health but we must also understand that for NHS patients, nothing matters more to them than confidence that the NHS will look after their own personal medical data with the highest standards of security.  ""The truth is the NHS have not won the public's trust in our ability to do this as today's completely unacceptable data breach at the Dean Street surgery demonstrates.""  The monthly newsletter was sent to patients signed up to the clinic's OptionE service, which lets people book appointments and receive test results by email.  The clinic originally tried to rectify its mistake by using Microsoft Outlook's recall feature.  This was followed by an email apology from Mr McOwan to patients.  Online magazine beyondpositive, which is for people living with or affected by HIV, said it had been contacted by patients affected by the breach.  Editor Tom Hayes said: ""This is a huge breach of confidentiality.""  He said trust between clinics and patients can take a long time to build up.  ""One person who contacted us said they were going to transfer their care to another clinic because that trust had gone,"" he said.  ""There may be friends finding out things about other friends because of this.""  One patient said. ""There are several names I recognise from the list and, while I am of course being discreet, I am not sure I trust every other person on the list to do the same.""  The newsletter contained details of physiotherapy sessions, mindfulness stress reduction courses and new telephone consultation clinics run by the service.  Another patient whose details were exposed by the email said the NHS has ""no way of controlling who sees this information now and, in the wrong hands, this list could be dynamite"".  He told The Guardian: ""I find it impossible to believe that in this day and age this can happen. I was able to scroll down the list and identify the names of a number of people who I knew, some of whom I was unaware of their status.""  The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which can levy fines of up to 500,000 for significant data breaches, said on Twitter that it was investigating the matter.  The National Aids Trust said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the leak.  Chief executive Deborah Gold said: ""Confidentiality is crucial to people living with HIV.

Rafael Henriquez Polanco, 30, and wife, Yanira Lopez, 27, according to delcotimes.com, allegedly filed fraudulent tax returns with fake W2 forms, sought $1.7 million in refunds and ended up with $257,710 in return money from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The couple had paid hospital employees to steal confidential medical forms and from there they would use those forms to steal patient identities. The couple is facing charges ranging from conspiracy to defraud the government, aggravated identity theft, passport fraud and presentation of an immigration application containing a false statement. The report also says that Lopez was charged with wire fraud and is looking at 52 years in prison if convicted while Polanco faces 32 years in jail if convicted. The U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service, the Department of Labor, IRS Criminal Investigations, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations handled the case and charges. But one has to wonder whether the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plans on getting involved in the case to see if Crozer could have prevented the patient data theft. Polanco and Lopez were Crozer Keystone Health System and, according to philly.com, Crozer spokesman Grant Gegwich said two employees, non-professional employees of the hospital employees, have been terminated for their involvement. While there were no other details, Gegwich said procedures for handling and disposal of documents containing patient information have been modified. Considering that Gegwich said the hospitals were notified of the information theft in October 2011, will those modifications be sufficient if HHS or the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) comes knocking?",http://healthitsecurity.com/2013/03/13/pa-health-system-reports-144-patient-data-identity-theft/

A notice on the non-profits site says: On October 16, 2013, Mosaic discovered that client information was in an email account of an employee who had fallen victim to an email phishing scam on an unknown date.  Mosaic has taken actions to secure the email account and law enforcement has been notified.  Phishing is an email scam that seeks to acquire information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. These email scams have become increasingly convincing and sophisticated in recent years.  During it investigation, Mosaic discovered that other Mosaic employees had been deceived by a similar phishing email scam. All affected email accounts were secured and passwords were changed.  Mosaic undertook a comprehensive review of the affected email accounts and confirmed that they contained client information used by Mosaic for administrative purposes and may have included clients names, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, birth certificates, drivers licenses or governmentissued identification cards, medical record numbers, insurance identification numbers, insurance/client payments, Medicaid and Medicare numbers, limited clinical information (which may include, but is not limited to: incident reports, diagnoses, procedures, prescription information), and, in some instances, Social Security numbers and financial account information.  At this time, all evidence suggests that the main target of this scam was the financial information of Mosaic.  However, Mosaic was unable to confirm whether the unknown party accessed information contained in the emails, and therefore, as a precautionary measure, began sending letters to affected clients on December 11, 2013.  Mosaic is offering to eligible affected clients a complimentary one-year membership in Experians ProtectMyID Alert credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.  Mosaic also has established a dedicated call center for clients to call with any questions.

The infected computer contained patient data and the malware went unnoticed for one day before staff members took measures to prevent any further malicious activity.  UW Medicine says that it conducted an internal investigation and does not believe that patient data was sought or targeted in the attack. Despite this belief, the malware is said to have accessed the personal information of more than 90,000 current and former patients. The potentially exposed data include names, medical record numbers, other demographics (which may include address, phone number), dates of service, charge amounts for services received, dates of birth, and Social Security Numbers or Health Insurance Claim (Medicare) numbers.  The press release also announces that UW Medicine has implemented a review and is conducting employee training and other outreach efforts in response to the incident.

Raquel Hogan, who formerly worked as a certified nursing assistant at Medical Management Health and Rehab LLC, also must pay $6,500 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service, a federal judge ordered during a hearing.  Hogan pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2013, but her sentencing was delayed until Thursday, according to court records.  In her plea agreement, Hogan admitted that she had provided stolen patient identity information to Yolanda Blount, another woman charged in the case.  Blount pleaded guilty to wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy, theft of public money, aggravated identity theft and access device fraud in 2013. She was sentenced to 27 years in prison last year, but she is appealing the sentence, claiming she received ineffective assistance from her lawyer.  Hogan admitted in her plea agreement that she met Blount in the Macon nursing homes parking lot and gave her a handwritten list of patient names, birth dates and Social Security numbers. Authorities later found the list when they searched Blounts New Clinton Road home.  Several false tax returns were filed using the nursing home residents names, and bank documents showed tax refunds issued based on the returns were deposited onto prepaid debit cards, according to the plea agreement.  Hogans conduct contributed to $17,577 in refunds, although only $6,500 was paid out by the U.S. Treasury.  During Thursdays hearing, defense attorney Catherine Williams asked the judge to allow her client to serve her sentence on probation, saying Hogan was only responsible for disclosing information for 13 people.  That is it, Williams said. She received no money for that.  Because of her criminal charges, Hogan can no longer work as a certified nursing assistant or in the medical field, Williams said.  Shes gone back to school while supporting her 2-month-old daughter, her 14-year-old stepdaughter and the stepdaughters child, Williams said.  This has made her start over, she said. Shes struggling to keep things together.  Hogans mother spoke on her behalf and pleaded with the judge, explaining that she wouldnt be able to care for her grandchildren if her daughter was sent to prison.  If Hogan was sentenced to prison, three children would go into the foster care system, Williams said.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Graham Thorpe said Hogan has cooperated with authorities and also helped them in a separate investigation.  Hogan apologized for her actions before being sentenced.

Accessing and reviewing a patient's information is only permitted by health care providers when they require that information in order to deliver care to that patient. The eChart system maintains a record of all user activity allowing for routine, as well as focused, audits to ensure patient information is not being inappropriately accessed.",http://www.databreaches.net/grace-hospital-pharmacist-inappropriately-accessed-health-information-winnipeg-health-region/; http://www.cjob.com/2015/03/17/66255/

Urology Associates sent data breach notification letters to patients, practice manager Tanna Darling told The Daily Inter Lake. Darling said that ""over a few thousand"" letters were sent out. However, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) online breach reporting database shows that 6,500 patients were affected and that OCR was notified on July 24.  Clinic officials reported that the break-in occurred at the clinic's storage unit in a locked and gated facility, and that it was likely that the unauthorized individual was renting a separate storage unit at the facility and therefore had access to the first gate.  ""Everything was in disarray, but it honestly didn't look like they took anything,"" Darling said.  Kalispell Police Department Captain Scott Warnell said that the incident is part of a larger trend that is happening across the county, and that the department is making extra patrols on storage units to ensure that unauthorized individuals are not in the area.  It was not specified what information was potentially accessed from the storage unit, but some form of PHI was likely involved as the health data breach was reported to the OCR. Moreover, patients whose information was possible accessed will receive one free year of credit monitoring from Urology Associates.  Repercussions for health data breaches are likely going to be stronger in Montana, as earlier this year the state updated its data breach notification law to account for medical information. House Bill (H.B.) 74 requires data breach notifications be sent to the state's attorney general and insurance commissioner, and was signed into law on Feb. 27 by Governor Steve Bullock.  ""Upon discovery or notification of a breach of the security of a data system, a state agency that maintains computerized data containing personal information in the data system shall make reasonable efforts to notify any person whose unencrypted personal information was or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person,"" the law states.  Montana Attorney General Tim Fox wrote a letter to the editor in The Montana Standard when the bill was passed, saying how pleased he was that changes were made.  ""HB 74 requires a single notification to my Office of Consumer Protection when those breaches occur,"" Fox wrote. ""It's my hope that by giving us notice of these breaches, we can better mobilize my team to assist consumers and even recommend ways to prevent such breaches in the future.""  Overall, there has been an increasing debate recently in how data breach notification laws should be handled. State Attorneys General recently wrote a letter to Congress, saying that it is essential that any federal data breach notification laws do not preempt state laws. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) said in its letter that many current state data breach notification laws have more protections than proposed federal legislation, and that states need to have the ability to enact and enforce state breach notification.  ""As we have seen over the past decade, states are better equipped to quickly adjust to the challenges presented by a data-driven economy,"" the group wrote. ""States have been able to amend their laws and focus their enforcement efforts on those areas most affecting consumers.""",http://healthitsecurity.com/news/potential-health-data-breach-for-montana-urology-clinic; http://www.dailyinterlake.com/members/vandal-gains-access-to-medical-files/article_c0e991ec-3984-11e5-a151-777a42ceb9bb.html; https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf

A third party, contracted for transcriptions of physician notes at Dignity Health Mercy Oncology Center, accidentally made public a link to some notes stored on a private server during a routine update, said Patrick Varga, Mercy Medical Centers chief operating officer.   The records are no longer public, Varga said.    On Dec. 13, a physician reviewing patient records discovered the link, he said. About 620 patients, who sought care June through October, have been affected, Nichols said.   The records included the patients names, dates of birth, diagnosis, medications, therapies and treatment plans, she said. They did not contain any Social Security numbers or financial information.  The link was removed immediately, and Mercy is working with Google to scrub any other links or archived versions of the web page, Varga said.   Mercy no longer contracts with the company.   Verga said there are no signs that any unauthorized individuals accessed the information, which was public for several weeks.   The leak is a protocol breach rather than a cyber security threat, said Rocky Slaughter, whose public relations company, Sugar Pine Media, designs websites.   The chances of the patients exposure is small.   As long as the information isnt posted on another server, or posted on Reddit (or other type of) social media, I think people will be OK, Slaughter said.    Google has a content removal process, he said.    Mercy also has been educating staff and its contractors on securing medical information, Varga said. It has contacted all patients affected and provided them with recommendations on how they can protect themselves from identity theft.

Health is notifying patients of a data breach after discovering a nursing assistant had accessed patient records in a manner unrelated to job responsibilities.  The health system learned of the inappropriate access to information during a May 27 routine patient record access audit, according to a notice posted on its website.  The nursing assistant accessed patients' electronic records, which may have included patient names, birth dates, addresses, medications, medical tests and results, other clinical information and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Additionally, the employee may have accessed insurance information for ""a limited number"" of patients, according to the health system.  According to an Orlando Sentinel report, the data breach affects 3,200 patients. The hospital indicates the breach only affects certain patients treated from January 2014 to May 2015 at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and a ""limited number"" of patients at Orlando Regional Medical Center.  The employee has been fired from Orlando Health.  The health system says there is no evidence the information has been used or removed from the hospital, and it is still unable to determine the exact information the employee viewed or why the employee accessed it.

Taking this type of information outside of the office is an inherent part of running a home care provider. But, the fact that Neath Care did not account for this fact by providing their staff with guidance on how to handle information in this setting, is alarming.  The provider must now improve their practices in order to protect the vulnerable people they serve. This will include introducing new guidance and training for their staff to make sure peoples information is kept secure and introduce a procedure for keeping a track of when personal information is taken off site.

A spokesman for the NHS Trust hospital said it is ""investigating the breach... in accordance with our policies and procedures, ""but security experts warn that staff credentials could be being sold online for ""dollars each"".  De Vere discovered the breach following research into the Lizard Stresser hack last year. He started researching Lizard Squad after the hacktivist group's Christmas Day 2014 DDoS attacks against Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live. De Vere signed up for a Lizard Stressor demo account with a spam email address to find out more.  Later, when the Lizard Stresser database, containing numerous customer email addresses, was compromised and published at the start of this year, he soon found he was on the receiving end of promotional emails from Russian hacking group 'Horux'.  Horux's website boasts of being ""private information sellers and underground kings"" and it sells everything from readily-available hacking tools to credit card details. ""We sell every tool that exists on the black market, our prices are reasonable and cheap,"" read one email from the group.  On this occasion, it appears to have accessed the email addresses leaked from Lizard Stresser and targeted them with promotional emails  perhaps assuming that all the names on this Lizard Stresser list were 'black hat' hackers.  Crucially, however, De Vere noticed these emails were being digitally signed by Kettering General Hospital  a strong sign that the hospital's email has been compromised. He believes that the hackers did this to avoid email spam filters. The emails appear to have been sent by a VPS server, hosted by Indian hosting company shocksrv, and then authenticated by the email server at the hospital.  De Vere explained how the attackers work. ""The group hack an organisation, gather what they want, then use the hacked email servers to forward these promotional offers,"" he said.  The email server would be ""at the attackers perusal"", further suggesting that ""the same credentials to be able to send mail from these servers could also be used to authenticate email accounts"".  With his knowledge of the Horux group, he added that staff email credentials would likely be sold on the black market for ""dollars each"" and suggested that the breach may well go beyond email at the hospital.  Most likely, the initial intrusion into the hospital servers would have been through a brute force attack against the email servers, or via credentials that were gathering as part of an ongoing phishing campaign.  Sources with close connections to the hospital have confirmed the security breach to our reporter, with some suggesting that the issue was ""swept under the carpet"" by senior executives at the hospital. It took two weeks for the hospital to acknowledge they were investigating the issue.  Infosec resources are also said to be tight at the organisation, which has around 3,000 staff.  Last week, the organisation advertised for an IM&T training manager to manage data quality and ensure ""information collection and recording is of the highest quality"".  The incident has been reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) which confirmed it is looking into the issue. ""We have received a complaint about Kettering Hospital and are making enquiries,"" a spokesperson said.  A spokesman for Kettering General Hospital said: ""The Trust has been made aware of an allegation that its IT security has been breached. We take this very seriously and are currently investigating the matter."" Requests for further information were declined and it is not clear whether personal information has been revealed, why the investigation has taken so long and whether the hospital had informed its staff.  Sarah Clarke, owner of the Infospectives Ltd Security GRC Consultancy, said considering the financial constraints in the public sector, she was not ""hugely surprised"" at the news.  She also said there were several unanswered questions regarding the breach. ""There could be so many reasons for a breach like this. How far 'in' this goes will be key. Is it limited to email servers? If not, what is the breadth and depth of compromise across their network? Has patient data been impacted?"" she told SC.  Clarke added that if the hospital was running its own email or DNS infrastructure, this could ""equate to painting a big red target on your business"".  She believes organisations will ultimately be judged on their response to data breaches. ""With breaches, as with any problems, how you deal with it is just as important as the fact it happened  don't skimp on planning an effective response no matter how secure you think you are. If PR-related panic and bureaucracy trumps prompt investigation and notification, it can be a dramatic own goal. I hope that's not the case here and, if it is, I hope staff or patients don't pay with their personal and financial security.""",http://www.scmagazineuk.com/exclusive-kettering-general-hospital-investigating-email-data-breach/article/439350/; http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/experts-investigating-alleged-breach-of-it-security-at-kettering-general-hospital-1-6969074

I'm talking birth dates, Social Security numbers, insurance info, diagnoses, addresses and more.  The Oakland Family Services, a nonprofit human and health services organization out of Pontiac, Michigan, is the company under fire and its patients are starting to receive the dreaded hacking warning.  On July 14, a hacker broke into an employee's email account and roamed around in the system for over 23 minutes.  In that time, the unidentified intruder sent phishing emails to a number of the employee's contacts. They also had access to incredibly private information such as names, client ID numbers, services dates, types of service provided, birth dates, telephone numbers, addresses, diagnoses, health plan ID numbers, insurance numbers and Social Security numbers.  The Oakland Family Services staff recognized the hacker after 15 minutes and worked diligently to cut him or her (or them) from the account.  After the debacle, David Partlo, director of IT at Oakland Family Services, released this statement:  ""We took action within 15 minutes of the intruder gaining access to block him or her from the affected email account and based on this incident, even stronger email protocol has been implemented. We feel reassured by the fact it doesn't appear the person gained access in search of PHI (protected healthcare information), but simply to perpetuate the phishing scheme, based on the amount of time the hacker spent in the account and the actions we know he or she took.""",http://www.hipaajournal.com/oakland-family-services-phishing-attack-claims-16k-victims-8099/; http://www.komando.com/happening-now/327720/private-health-info-leaked-in-serious-data-breach

It looked like junk mail, so Patricia put off opening it.  When she finally read it, the first paragraphs alarmed her: ""Regrettably, we are writing to inform you about an incident involving your health information.""  In November, an ""electronic device"" had been stolen out of the locked car of an employee of a company contracting with her hospital, Sentara Norfolk General. It ""may have contained clinical and demographic information"" about her, including name, birth date, patient number and medical record number.  Patricia's medical records were not on the device, however. Neither was her Social Security number or information about her bank account or insurance.  The company, Omnicell Inc., ""has no reason to believe that the device was taken for the information it contained, or that the information has been accessed or used improperly.""  Patricia felt better, but small doubts persisted.  ""Should I believe them?"" she wondered, ""I don't know.""  The 38-year-old Norfolk woman was among 56,000 Sentara Healthcare patients to receive that letter and among millions nationwide made vulnerable each year by lapses in security protecting their personal health information.  Such large-scale breaches are rare: 152 incidents were reported in 2011 among more than 700,000 organizations, according to the Health Information Trust Alliance. Smaller lapses are more common, averaging in the tens of thousands a year.  Breaches range from improperly discarded paper records to unauthorized access to a health provider's email account. A dishonest employee may pass along patient information for fraudulent use, or an unencrypted flash drive may go missing.  Some lapses likely are never discovered.

But 2 NEWS Investigates uncovered a lawsuit by two local women that alleges they repeatedly had the privacy of their health information violated by employees at Kettering Health Network, also known as Kettering Adventist Healthcare.  Every time you see a new doctor you probably sign a notice of privacy practices. Its part of a national law called HIPAA.  Its meant to keep things like your visits to the doctor and even your billing information from getting into the wrong hands.  But Kettering Health Network and its former employee are being sued accused of not following that law.  Vicki Sheldon and her daughter Haley say they feel violated.  I dont know if I could feel anymore violated then if I had just been stripped down naked and walked in front of every executive in Kettering, said Vicki.  They claim Kettering Health Network employees wrongfully accessed their health information.  Vicki said Kettering first alerted her to the violation. According to Vicki, Kettering told her that her ex-husband, Duane Sheldon who worked in the Administration Department at Kettering, had inappropriately looked at her records.  I received some reports directly from Kettering, from their system. Quite frankly when I got them I was very disturbed by the number of people who had no reason to be in my records had been in my records apparently just whenever they felt like looking.  Vicki said that report showed her records were looked at again and again for 15 months by people who she says had nothing to do with her care.  Both women believe Kettering Health Network did not have the appropriate procedures in place to protect their private records.  Theyre suing both Kettering Health Network and Duane Sheldon for invasion of privacy and negligence.  Duane Sheldons attorney told me hes declining an interview but provided a brief statement that says in part, much of the Plaintiffs Complaint is inaccurate and personally inflammatory.  According to his attorney, Duane Sheldon no longer works for Kettering Health Network.  Kettering declined to comment directly about the lawsuit.  But regardless of the legal side of things, 2 NEWS Investigates wanted to know how safe your information really is and if there was in fact a breach at a health network that serves thousands of people in the Miami Valley.  The Director of Compliance Program, Megan Brickner who oversees patient protection agreed to answer questions.  Natalie: Was there a HIPAA violation at this network by employees?  Brickner: I cannot comment to that in particular, but I can say again we have this Protect program that we are continuously looking at the risk landscape and if we see something we need to address then we do so,  Brickner said not every employee has access to every part of a patients record. The access they get is based on their job title.  She also said Kettering has a system in place that notifies them if a patients record was accessed by the wrong person.  There are reports that get ran. We also have a third party come in every year looking at our IT infrastructure, she said.  Brickner wouldnt go into detail about the types of reports that are run or disclose the latest results of them.  But she does say if your records were looked at inappropriately its required by law to let you know.  Natalie: Should patients be worried about their medical information?  Brickner: To be honest with you, I think everyone needs to always be vigilant. I think its very important to be your own advocate.  Natalie: Are you running those reports and is everything working?  Brickner: Yes. Everything is working. I will tell you how well its working. We do have a commitment to protecting patient privacy and securing their information.  Vicki said those answers are not enough.  I would hate for anybody to have to go through this. Its humiliating. Its degrading. It takes away your power, said Vicki Sheldon.  According to public court documents Duane Sheldon and Kettering are asking that the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing that individuals cant sue over HIPAA violations.  2 NEWS Investigates went to the top legal expert in the state to find out.  My understanding of the law is that individuals do not have the right to sue under the HIPAA law but what they could do is file under a tort law of common law that exists in every state and file an action under that, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.  DeWine said a states attorney general and the US Department of Health and Human Services are the ones who can take legal action when someone believes their health information was violated.  Vicki and Haleys attorney said the government is overburdened and this case is about more than HIPAA violations. Its about an invasion of privacy.  Its a new and emerging area of the law therefore in Ohio, this type of breach doesnt have a lot of case law behind it, but there are other states notably Indiana and California where theres been significant privacy violations, said Vicki and Haleys attorney, Rob Croskery.  According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, you have the right to see and get a copy of your health records and who has looked at them. All you need to do is ask your hospital for them. In most cases they have up to 30 days to provide the copy.",http://wdtn.com/2014/08/13/hospital-responds-after-privacy-allegations/

Dozens of papers with patient names, addresses, phone numbers and social insurance numbers were found near Leslie Street and Sheppard Avenue on Saturday, not far from North York General Hospital.  Hospital staff ruled out any connection to its patients, but information printed on some of the documents indicated they may have come from more than one doctors office in the GTA.  Ontarios Privacy Commission says such a breach of privacy should never happen.  Its critical to realize that disposal does not mean putting them in the garbage, putting them in the recycling bin, said Brian Beamish, the acting commissioner for the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.  One of the offices linked to the documents was that of dentist Doctor Howard Libstug in Maple, Ontario.  He did not want to comment on camera but said in a statement:  It is to my great dismay that some personal information of two of my patients has been found improperly disposed of. We are currently investigating exactly how this information was not shredded, and further, how it was transported from our locked garbage facilities to a bin that was open to the public.  Libstugs office employs Clarkes Property Services to clean and dispose its trash. But even with a third party cleaner, the privacy commission said, the doctor would be held accountable.  It is the health professional who is ultimately responsible for how these records are disposed of, said Beamish. Thats why its critical that theres an understanding with a third party provider like a cleaning company in terms of how the records will be securely destroyed.  Especially since personal information could be easy prey for identitiy thieves. Lawyer Lonny Rosen from Rosen Sunshine says patients could sue their doctors if there is a breach of confidentiality and privacy that leads to damages.  Theres a tort called intrusion upon seclusion and that is another way in which people can sue if their personal health information has been accessed inappropriately, said Rosen. But that is still subject to a determination by the Ontario court of appeal.  Rosen adds the health information custodian has an obligation under the legislation to disclose to the patients whose health information was accessed inappropriately. Global News reached out to a patient listed on one of the documents but they did not want to comment. City crews have since cleaned up the mess. Global News will continue to follow this story.

It is currently unclear if HIPAA violations occurred, but the records have since been transferred safely.2014-01-27-87333166  Medical records dated from 1992-2012 were discovered in a warehouse, according to a KTRK report. The papers included details on abortions and individuals Social Security numbers. Opioid drug containers were also found in the warehouse.  Esmerelda Cedillo made the discovery, and told the news source that the warehouse is hers but has been unused for about seven years. An estranged relative who used to work at an abortion clinic is believed to have left the records behind.  So I put myself in their shoes, and thats why Im like, I dont want this to just get thrown out there, Cedillo said. But I dont know what to do because I dont want to have them in my possession anymore. I want them gone.  Cedillo explained that she discovered the medical records while she was walking her dog on the property. The animal reportedly tore up several files and then dragged them outside.  A follow-up KTRK report stated that the law firm Cardwell and Chang contacted Cedillo after the airing of the original story. The firm told the news station that they had been hired to be the custodians of the medical records after the abortion clinic in question was closed.  All of a sudden when it aired, I got the call first thing this morning, Cedillo said.  A former clinic employee had been put in charge of keeping the records safe, a lawyer explained, and doctors were told that the records had been destroyed.  They were in the process of being shredded several years ago, ended up here, but didnt make it to their destination, said an attorney from the firm Noah Meek, which picked up the files. If theyre more than seven years old, theyll likely be shredded or if not, sorted through and returned to the patients.  Susan Cardwell from Cardwell and Chang told KTRK that the medical files belonged to patients who had attended the Cunningham Clinic, KNS Clinic, and Womens Clinic. The former employee who had been in charge of the information did not return the stations phone calls. However, the doctor who opened the former clinic said that he kept all of his medical records when he sold it in 2003 and then lawfully destroyed them.

The company has now secured the device and data and has enlisted the help of a specialist data security firm to conduct a forensic data analysis to determine whether data was accessed during that time frame.  The matter has also been reported to various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, and government and state authorities have also been notified of the security breach.

Alexander Afonso, 40, of Frederick also must serve six months of home detention as part of a two-year supervised-release period after his prison term ends. U.S. District Judge Marvin Garbis in Baltimore also ordered Afonso to pay $75,000 in restitution to Frederick-based Service Coordination Inc., where he worked for three months in mid-2013 as an information technology manager and systems administrator.  The company terminated Afonso's employment and revoked his computer access Oct. 13, 2013, for reasons not disclosed in court records. Four days later, Afonso used another employee's username and password without her permission to begin the process of obtaining personal information of 11,238 clients  about half the state's total population of adults and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities, according to court records.  Afonso pleaded guilty in January to an identity theft charge that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, plus restitution.  The company incurred costs to investigate the breach, restore security, notify clients and provide them with a year's worth of identity theft protection, according to the plea agreement.  Marcy Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Maryland U.S. attorney's office, said in an email there is no indication Afonso used the information for harm or planned to do so.

A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said. Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source.  An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician. Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers ""Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,"" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal cords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.  Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later.  Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures... nor is he currently serving as medical director."" The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.",http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/showbiz/joan-rivers-clinic/

The incident was reported to HHS as impacting Community 113,528 patients' records.  Original post:  There's an update to a breach reported previously on this site. From a statement on their site:  Community Mercy Health Partners (CMHP) and its hospitals, Springfield Regional Medical Center and Mercy Memorial Hospital, are committed to protecting the confidentiality of our patients' personal information and are providing this notice concerning an incident involving some of that information.  On November 27, 2015, law enforcement contacted CMHP and advised us that CMHP's patient records were found in a public recycling dumpster. CMHP employees immediately went to the recycling site, retrieved all the documents in the dumpster, and began an internal investigation. Our investigation determined that a CMHP vendor had inadvertently disposed of the lab records in the dumpster on November 25, 2015.  The lab records may include patients' names, physicians' names, accession numbers, types of study, guarantor information, health insurance information, diagnoses, other clinical information, and in some instances Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers.  This incident did not affect all CMHP patients but in an abundance of caution we began mailing letters on January 25, 2016. We also established dedicated call center for patients to call with any questions. If you believe you are affected but do not receive a letter by February 15, 2016, please call 1-877-810-8083 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern Time. We also recommend that affected patients review the explanation of benefits they receive from their health insurer. If they see services that they did not receive, please contact the insurer immediately.  CMHP regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused our patients. To help prevent this from happening in the future, we have taken steps to re-inventory all document storage locations, significantly reduced or eliminated retention of paper documents when the information is electronically available, and re-educated our facilities management contractors on the requirements for physical storage relocation projects.",http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/news/local/community-mercy-alerting-patients-to-data-breach/nk3MK/#__federated=1; http://www.databreaches.net/oh-more-details-emerge-about-patient-records-found-at-recycling-center/; http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/private-patient-records-found-dumped-in-springfiel/npgz5/; http://www.databreaches.net/oh-community-mercy-health-partners-notifies-patients-after-vendor-improperly-discarded-patient-records/

The staffer had a 1-800 telephone number and a 1-866 fax number, and the two things got transposed, said the Central Health CEO.  The incident in question, which was made public Tuesday by Central Health, saw personal health information of 52 Central Health patients faxed in error to a company in Calgary, Alta., which, according to Goodyear, was supposed to go to an auditing company.  The faxed information actually went fax-to-email to an unused email account of the Calgary-based company. According to Goodyear, the email wasnt noticed until the company received an invoice for receiving fax-to-email transactions, and questioned the invoice with its service provider.  This was an isolated event, and it in no way impacted the care of the clients involved, said Goodyear. This information ... in no way impacted on the care provided to these particular clients because what we were involved in was an after-the-fact exercise of verifying physician billing.  Goodyear said she has been assured by the company the person who checked the email following the inquisition was the only one to do so, and that person contacted Central Health immediately after seeing the cover sheet of the fax. Also, all of the information had been sent back to Central Health and deleted from the companys email system.  As of Tuesday afternoon, 29 of the 52 patients have been contacted by the physicians that provided their personal care, and the remaining patients will be contacted as soon as possible to inform them how it happened and what Central Health has done to correct such an incident from a potential recurrence.  Despite not all patients involved in the incident having been contacted, Goodyear said Central Health wanted to get the word out about the incident as quickly as it could to avoid massive worry among its clients.  We do consider these things to be of a serious nature, and when they happen we do address them and we do a full disclosure,"" she said.     Change of policy  In light of this privacy breach, Central Health has revisited its faxing policy, and according to Goodyear, it clarifies the circumstances in which faxing is permitted.  Goodyear said she knows the changes to the faxing policy will not be 100 per cent perfect.  We work in a system where it is a human service, and its a service based on the due diligence of our staff, and no matter how much confidence or how much details are put in place there will be times that errors will be made, she said. But we looked to see how we can mitigate and reduce that as much as we possibly can.  She added Central Health employees would be communicated with in several different ways to ensure every staff member is aware of the recent incident and what has been changed in the faxing policy.  The one thing we can say here with a 100 per cent degree of certainty is that there was no impact on the care of the clients in this incident,"" she said.

Six of the letters included sensitive medical information relating to the patients treatment.  An ICO investigation found that the employee responsible for the mistake hadnt received any form of data protection training. While the health board had introduced mandatory data protection training for all staff in April 2013, by February 2014 only 6.5% of staff had received it. The health board informed the ICO that it did not anticipate providing the training to all of their staff until April 2015.  ICO Assistant Commissioner for Wales, Anne Jones, said:  We accept mistakes can happen, but organisations must make sure employees handling sensitive personal information are given the necessary training to carry out their role. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board failed to do this.  The health board has now signed an undertaking committing the organisation to improving the training provided to its employees. This includes prioritising staff who manage sensitive information as part of their core role, or who work in a lead information governance role within the organisation by ensuring theyve received data protection training by 30 September 2014.

You might think that the lawsuit is about the nose job gone wrong. But, no, her complaint is that Dr. Mashkevich put ""before"" and ""after"" pictures he took of Manizone online as an example of his work. $23 million? New York does have a relatively strong ""publicity rights"" law -- which are state based laws that are being increasingly expanded and abused these days. However, at their core, the idea is that people wouldn't be put in advertisements or seen as endorsing a product or service without their permission. So, perhaps there's a small publicity rights claim here, though it would be surprising if Dr. Mashkevich never actually had patients sign a release form for the use of such photos (Update: there is evidence that she signed a form saying the photos were only for her confidential files, so it appears that he did fail to get the proper permission). Of course, even if he failed in that basic step, the idea that having these photos posted online should lead to a $23 million award is just insane.   Equally as ridiculous is the idea that finding these pictures online caused such horrible harm to Manizone and her reputation. In the lawsuit, she explains the ""harm"" the photos have caused: Plaintiff has been, is and will continue to be greatly distressed and humiliated, has been, is and will continue to be exposed to public ridicule and contempt; and the plaintiff has been, is and will continue to be greatly injured in her reputation and has been, is and will continue to be otherwise greatly injured.   As Plaintiff's photographs are still available for viewing on the World Wide Web, Plaintiff's damages continue to accrue to date and will continue for an undeterminable period of time. Of course, there are a few issues with this. First, the surgery happened in January of 2011 ""to improve her appearance, self esteem and confidence"" but she didn't notice the photos online until February 2013. If she didn't even know the photos were online for two years how could she possibly have been so greatly distressed by the photos online? If they were really causing her to be ""exposed to public ridicule and contempt"" then, um, wouldn't she have examples of that actually happening?   Second, I'm still trying to figure out why she would have been subject to ""public ridicule and contempt"" merely for getting a nose job. I mean, I guess it's possible, but wouldn't people who already knew her simply notice the nose job? And would people who didn't know her really care at all?   Finally, and most importantly, it seems likely that filing a highly questionable $23 million lawsuit against your plastic surgeon is a hell of a lot more likely to create public ridicule and contempt than any before and after photos of a nose job. So, will she be suing her lawyer next for being ""greatly distressed and humiliated"" while being ""exposed to public ridicule and contempt"" for filing this lawsuit? And, of course, if she was concerned that people would know she got a nose job because of the photos, which even she didn't realize existed for two years, shouldn't someone have pointed out to her that filing a public lawsuit like this would be a hell of a lot more likely to draw attention to the fact that she got a nose job?   Again, if it really is true that he used her images without signed permission, there may be a minor publicity rights issue, but the claims about public ridicule and contempt, along with the idea that the photos created massive damages, just don't make any sense. Combined with the insane request for $23 million, the whole thing really feels a lot more like a money grab than a serious complaint.",https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130627/18004323644/woman-sues-plastic-surgeon-23-million-because-he-put-beforeafter-pictures-her-web.shtml

The HSE has confirmed that there were approximately 180 childrens details on the Speech abnd Language Therapy Service laptop stolen from the boot of a car last week.  The register has the details of the children listed by service location, care group, their name, address and contact phone number.  Responding to queries from Highland Radio News, the HSE has confirmed the laptop was fully encrypted.  The HSE says it has written to all parents of clients whose details were on the register to inform them of the breach, and advising them whom then should contact if they had any concerns.  The matter was immediately reported to an Garda Siochana who are investigating the theft. It has also been notified to the Data Protection Commissioner.

Haley VA Medical Center,"The documents with the Social Security numbers of veterans treated at the James A. Haley VA Medical Center were supposed to be shredded by a company whose website warns, ""Don't become a victim of identity theft.""  But the firm, federal prosecutors say, employed a 24-year-old with a criminal history who kept those records out of the shredder, instead selling them to individuals who used the documents to file fraudulent tax returns.  Federal marshals on Wednesday arrested Willie Streater of E Hamilton Avenue in Tampa on eight charges accusing him of stealing the Social Security numbers of at least 34 veterans treated at Haley in 2011 and 2012. Prosecutors say $1.1 million was stolen.  It is the second case filed since 2013 charging someone with stealing identifying information of veterans treated at Haley.  Streater worked for Secure Waste Disposal Inc. of Orlando, a company under contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs to shred documents at the North Tampa hospital, prosecutors say. The indictment did not say what kind of patient records were involved in the case.  Since 2007, Streater has accepted plea deals on charges that included the sale and possession of cocaine, grand theft and burglary, FDLE and Hillsborough court records show. A judge withheld adjudication in the cases and Streater received probation.  Streater is being held on $35,000 bail. Federal prosecutors could not say if others would be charged in the case.  Secure Waste Disposal officials did not return a call Friday seeking comment. VA spokespersons in Tampa and Washington, D.C. declined to talk about the case.  VA policy requires a criminal background check for employees. It is unclear if that policy extends to contractors. The VA revamped rules concerning document shredding in 2008 after investigators found that agency employees improperly destroyed veteran claim documents.  But those rules generally addressed shredding by VA employees, not contractors.  Streater is charged with five counts of the wrongful disclosure of health information, two counts of credit card fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. The aggravated identity theft charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison, while each of the other charges carries a potential 10-year prison sentence.  The case was investigated by the VA's inspector general, Tampa police and the IRS.  The VA has been much criticized in the last decade for failing to safeguard the personal information of veterans, including an incident in 2006 when a thief stole a laptop containing personal data on 26 million veterans.  In March, a former Haley clerk was sentenced to six years in federal prison after he admitted stealing the Social Security numbers of 59 patients. The defendant in that case said he often traded the information for drugs.  ",http://www.tampabay.com/news/military/veterans/man-accused-of-stealing-haley-va-patient-id-info/2194269

It's a word that makes people tremble. Even when a case is curable, the stress on patients is indescribable.  We all know that. Everyone has been touched.  Preying on people with cancer is one of the most despicable acts imaginable. Yet that's exactly what one Elizabeth City woman is accused of doing.  If she's found guilty, the court should take her cynical choice of victims into consideration at sentencing.  Chesapeake police say T'sha Riddick used information she gleaned while working at Cancer Specialists of Tidewater, part of the Riverside Health System, to commit credit card fraud and identity theft. Riverside sent out letters to more than 2,000 patients who may have come in contact with Riddick during her almost two years of employment. A spokesman for Riverside told me that Riddick was terminated in early June.  She faces 13 criminal charges.  Chesapeake Police spokeswoman Kelly O'Sullivan said Thursday that the investigation is ongoing and more charges may be coming. The 33-year-old Riddick is out on bond and due in court August 25.  At least one of the victims had a credit card used exclusively to pay for Riverside medical expenses. When that person found other charges, police say they were notified.  Sickening.  Even more disturbing is news that Riddick was convicted of a similar crime nine years ago.  According to a story by Pilot reporter Scott Daugherty, Riddick pleaded guilty in 2005 to credit card fraud and obtaining property under false pretenses in Pasquotank County. That alone should have disqualified her from any job that gave her even limited access to personal information.  There's more.  In 2008, Riddick was convicted of misdemeanor theft in North Carolina. Last year, ""she was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of stolen property and three counts of misdemeanor worthless checks,"" according to Daugherty's reporting.  Riverside apparently didn't know about Riddick's checkered criminal past because, as an unlicensed medical assistant, she was not automatically subject by the company to a criminal background check.  ""We complete criminal background checks on all positions mandated by law,"" Riverside spokesman Peter Glagola told me Thursday.  Those include licensed health care providers, workers at child care centers, maternity units and a number of other positions, he said.  Medical assistants, whose primary job is to take patients to examining rooms, record weight and height, draw labs and sometimes collect payment are not subject to criminal background checks, Glagola said.  An assistant can still see highly personal information on patient charts - date of birth, Social Security number and address - as well as credit card and bank routing numbers, during checkout.  On Thursday, Sentara Healthcare spokesman Dale Gauding told me that Sentara - with 28,000 employees - performs criminal background checks on every person offered employment. Bon Secours Hampton Roads Health System also checks the criminal history of all employees.  Glagola said Riverside is looking into doing the same, but noted that they are moving cautiously, lest they violate Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations.  ""A lot of times they don't support blanket background checks,"" he said.  Oh really? Well, let the EEOC explain why the rights of convicts should ever trump the privacy rights of cancer patients.  Look, felons who have paid their debt to society deserve second chances. Within reason, that is. They should never be given jobs that come with daily temptations. Drug offenders shouldn't work in pharmacies, for instance. Embezzlers shouldn't be anywhere near payrolls. Child molesters need to be kept far away from minors.  People who have committed credit card fraud shouldn't be allowed even a peek at personal information.  The callous nature of the acts for which Riddick is accused bring to mind another case that  involved another health care worker.  In 2008, a nurse in Sentara Bayside Hospital's emergency room stole a credit card from a 75-year-old financial adviser who'd died of a heart attack in a supermarket parking lot.  Six hours after the death, Matthew Wiseman used the card to buy a computer at Best Buy.  Caught on surveillance tape shopping in his hospital scrubs, the nurse pleaded guilty to credit card theft and credit card fraud and was sentenced to eight years in prison, with all but 30 days suspended.  For years now, I thought of that as the most audacious crime committed in Hampton Roads.","http://www.dailypress.com/health/dp-nws-security-breach-riverside-20140729,0,1160235.story; http://hamptonroads.com/2014/07/riverside-health-warns-2000-possible-data-breach; http://hamptonroads.com/2014/07/cancer-hard-enough-and-then-data-theft-too"

The Secret Service tells WDBJ7 this is a multi-state investigation.  A LewisGale spokesperson says approximately 40 local patients are affected. The billing company says the billing information of 400 people may have been compromised. We're talking about patients' names, addresses, insurance information and social security numbers.  As one LewisGale patient says, it doesn't take much more than that to ruin someone's credit and someone's life.  Jim Clendenen received the letter about a week ago. The letter says that his private, personal information may have gotten into the wrong hands.  We're retired now and everything we got is taking care of. I'd hate to have somebody stumble in there and take care of everything that we've worked all these years for, Clendenen said.  The letter is from Salem Hospitalists in Tennessee. The group is part of the LewisGale Regional Health System.  According to the U.S. Secret Service, an employee from the group's billing office is being investigated for identity theft.  The letter goes on to read that Clendenen's records were among those accessed by the now former employee between August 27, 2012 and April 23, 2013.  Wondering how and why they would let an employee have access to something that he had no reason to have, Clendenen said.  The Secret Service tells WDBJ7 the investigation is ongoing, and the suspect hasn't been indicted as of yet.  But investigators say the former employee has fraudulently obtained credit, opened accounts, and even leased apartment with other people's information.  As of right now, Clendenen's credit is clear, but he continues to worry about ""what if.  I just hope maybe something can be done to prevent you or someone else going through what Im going through right now, Clendenen said.

Incyte Corporation sued Flexus Biosciences, its CEO Terry Rosen and its president and research director Juan Jaen, on Sept. 4 in New Castle County Court.      Incyte claims the defendants hired away Jordan Fridman, its chief scientific officer, because he was one of only a few Incyte employees privy to the successful clinical results of the cancer drug known as IDO-1 inhibitor.      Fridman is not a party to the complaint. Fridman, Rosen and Jaen are all referred to as ""Drs."" in the complaint, though it is unclear whether they are M.D.s or Ph.D.s.      Incyte claims Fridman had signed a confidentiality agreement with it, but provided Flexus with trade secrets that helped the biotechnology startup sell its assets to Bristol-Meyers Squibb for $1.25 billion just 18 months after forming.      Those assets, says Incyte, include information Fridman took about the IDO-1 inhibitor research.      The defendants knew that Incyte's clinical success with its IDO-1 inhibitor was a ""significant medical breakthrough with potentially far-reaching implications,"" and they ""unlawfully used that information for their own benefit,"" Incyte says in the complaint.      Incyte claims that upon interviewing and hiring Fridman in late 2013, ""Flexus abruptly decided to focus the great majority of its research and drug development efforts on the very IDO-1 mechanism that was subject to the clinical success.""      In fact, Incyte claims, while the defendants were courting Fridman, Flexus ""received a multimillion-dollar tranche of Series A funding from nonparty venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.""      This capital infusion points to ""Flexus's decision to 'bet the company' on IDO-1 inhibitor research and Kleiner Perkins' decision to fund that endeavor,"" according to the complaint.      Incyte claims Fridman gave notice in December 2013, but stayed on through early March 2014, without disclosing that he would be working for a competitor. During those three months, Incyte says, Fridman gathered more confidential information on the IDO-1 inhibitor research, even requesting ""access to confidential Incyte information relating to IDO-1 inhibitors.""      Although a subordinate challenged him at least once about why he needed the information, ""Dr. Fridman overcame these concerns and objections by issuing direct orders to provide him with the confidential information,"" the complaint states.      After leaving, Incyte says, Fridman failed to inform it that he was ""working for another pharmaceutical company with a competing IDO-1 inhibitor candidate.""      At an industry conference in June 2014, Fridman ""falsely told Incyte's employees that Flexus did not have an IDO-1 inhibitor project and that he was no longer working on IDO-1 inhibitors,"" according to the lawsuit.      But in late 2014, Fridman admitted in an email to Incyte's chief medical and development officer that he had been working on an IDO-1 inhibitor project at Flexus during that industry conference, Incyte says.      It seeks ""in excess of $1 billion"" in damages for misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference with contract, unjust enrichment, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting.",http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/09/11/1-billion-claim-over-a-cancer-drug.htm

Jesse William McGraw, 25, of Arlington, Texas, was taken into custody late Friday evening after posting screenshots showing he had complete control of computers that administered air-conditioning systems at The Carrell Clinic in Dallas, federal prosecutors said. McGraw also brazenly posted videos showing him installing malware on hospital computers that made them part of a botnet he operated, said a network security expert, whose sleuthing uncovered the breach.  As a contract security guard at the hospital, McGraw had no authorized access to any of its computers. But that didn't stop the miscreant, who went by the handle GhostExodus, from taping himself as he walked down the halls of the hospital with a blue security guard uniform poking out through a gray hoody, as he bragged about gaining control over sensitive computers.  ""It's a unique mindset among these hackers,"" said Wesley McGrew, a 29-year-old network PhD network security researcher at Mississippi State University. ""It's all about respect and fame and the respect of their equally weird peers.""  According to McGrew and federal prosecutors in Dallas, McGraw was the leader of a hacker gang known as the Electronik Tribulation Army. He had recently posted videos admonishing fellow hackers to carry out a ""massive DDoS,"" or distributed denial of service, attack on July 4, a date he called ""Devil's Day"". While the target and other details of the attack are unknown, the investigators are taking the threat seriously because McGraw, prior to his arrest, had tendered his resignation as a security guard job effective July 3.  According to court documents, hospital officials had experienced problems with their HVAC, or heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, units and were perplexed why none of the system alarms had gone off as programmed. Had they seen screenshots posted here by someone calling themselves GhostExodus, they would have known why. They images showed the HVAC control window for the hospital's surgery unit. A test alarm setting was turned to ""inactive.""  ""You almost can't help it ya know,"" GhostExodus writes. ""It must be done!""",http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/01/hospital_hacker_arrested/

When asked how long the information had been posted publicly online, Eriksen Leary said hospital officials are not sure, but they are currently working with MDF to determine that information. The hospital has been working with MDF Transcription for 10 years.   This is the first reported HIPAA breach for BMC involving more than 500 patients, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

That number is poised to increase as business associates are now liable under the new HIPAA rule.    Following the HIPAA final rule, which took effect back in September 2013, HIPAA-covered entities have expressed a growing mistrust over their BAs' ability to handle sensitive patient information.

""I find things that are publicly available on the internet that should probably not be public available,"" said Chris Vickery, a cyber security researcher who lives in Austin, Texas. ""Things like databases that have no password and are configured for public access. ""  Vickery said he found a security flaw in a database of Jefferson Medical patient information.  ""I was just going through randomly looking at the publicly available, configured for public access databases on those ports, and this one showed up,"" he said. ""When I realized there social security numbers and names and phone numbers and prescription information, it dawned on me that 'hey this probably should not be public if it is real data.' So then I started the process of trying to figure out whose it was.""   Jefferson Medical said Vickery was an unauthorized individual who shouldn't have had access to that information.  ""This information is private information,"" said Katie Gilchrist, Jefferson Medical's legal counsel. ""It's federally protected information. It's information that was on our server. This individual accessed it without our permission. He did in secret. There has never been a time when patient information in Jefferson Medical's possession has been just out there for anyone to get to.""  Vickery agrees he shouldn't have had access and said that's why he alerted the clinic to the hole in its security.  ""It was as available as a website is,"" Vickery said.  Gilchrist said, ""Basically it's like leaving a window unlocked in your house. You leave the house, and you leave a window unlocked. These folks out there think that entitles them to come into the house and look around at all your stuff and then take things with them when they leave. That's just not appropriate.""  Vickery said this isn't a hack because the information was readily available to anyone who knew where to look.  ""There was nothing to hack,"" Vickery said. ""There simply was no password, no user name, no security features of any sort being used. If you want to use a real analogy, here's a better one. I drove along a country road, a public country road, that not many people drive along, and on the side of the road, there were some records. Jefferson Medical left those records there. I took pictures of them and hunted down Jefferson and told them their records were on the side of the road. There's no crime involved there. That's not hacking. That's simply them being negligent.""  Gilchrist said and internal investigation is ongoing, and Jefferson Medical has already increase security in response to the breach.  ""We have an outside security company that was engaged prior to this,"" she said. ""They have come back in since this. They have done a complete overhaul of our systems and have found that other than this one place that this individual found to get in, everything else is secure. (They found that) he was only able to get into a very limited piece of that information, and nobody can get into that piece of information now. They have fixed that and closed it up.""  Gilchrist said about 10 percent of patients' information could have been compromised, which she said was about 10,000 people. However, Vickery said he saw as many as 62,000 records in the database.  ""If they're saying there are only 10,000 entries, they're trying to claim there were a lot of duplicates.""  Gilchrist said HIPPA requires data breaches to be reported to the Office of Civil Rights with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which she said Jefferson medical has done. She said there is also an ongoing law enforcement investigation, but couldn't say what agencies are involved or if she thought Vickery could face criminal charges.   Vickery said he finds these kinds of security flaws for numerous companies. He said didn't steal, sell or use that patient information at all and never intended to do so.

That failure to encrypt, combined with human error, resulted in a regrettable privacy breach.  On December 27, CMH discovered that materials with patients names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and certain medical diagnoses had been transmitted to AAMS on December 12. AAMS then used that information, in error, to send introductory letters to the patients and, in some cases, they sent them medical equipment.  When CMH discovered their error, they contacted AAMS, who destroyed their copy of the data, and agreed that no further letters would be sent out. Patients who received equipment from AAMS were asked to contact them to arrange for the return of the equipment at no cost to them.  Because CMH and AAMS are both covered by HIPAA, this breach was not as bad as it might have been, although clearly it was an unintended disclosure of PHI that patients needed to be informed about.  As part of preventing future incidents of this kind, CMH is undertaking a number of steps, including deploying encryption when emailing outside the company. Actually, they should have been doing that anyway, as even though they may trust the recipient, failure to encrypt allows capture or interception of the communications by attackers.  You can read CMHs report to the New Hampshire Attorney Generals Office and their notification to three New Hampshire residents here (pdf).  The total number of patients notified was not reported.  Update: The breach also affected 16 Maryland residents, but we still dont know the total number affected.

We take patient privacy very seriously, and its currently under investigation to fully evaluate the situation, Samaritan spokeswoman Janelle Iverson said Friday.  Janet Wood, who travels to Corvallis from Newport for medical care, opened the trash can to throw away tissue when she made the discovery.  I didnt have my glasses on, but I grabbed a stack of papers off the top and sifted through and saw a couple things in bold print  one said pregnancy results, one said diagnosis, she said. I was so shook up, thinking about if something like that happened to me ... there were written prescriptions in there, signed in ink, for narcotics  lots of them.  The documents, according to Capt. Dave Henslee of the Corvallis Police Department, bore the address of Samaritan Family Medicine Resident Clinic. The responding officer witnessed the clinics employees recover several hundred documents from the receptacle, Henslee said. Because Wood told the officer the paperwork was confidential in nature, he didnt look at them and police did nothing further because no crime had been committed, he said.  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 sets privacy standards for patients medical information. If a breach of privacy did occur, the clinic could be subject to civil lawsuit or an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, which has the authority to impose penalties.  The paperwork would have had to have contained individually identifiable health information  like medical documents with patients names  to have been considered a breach, and Wood didnt look closely enough to see if that kind of information was present.  Wood said there was more than just one stack of papers in the garbage.  They started taking documents out in their hands, she said. Then they realized that the garbage can was all the way full of them, so they took the entire garbage can.  Someone from Samaritan Health Services contacted Wood after the incident.  She called me about an hour later and said that they were investigating it but they believed that it was the cleaning person that mistakenly took it out to the garbage, Wood recalled.  Iverson would not provide details about the case or of Samaritans protocols in disposing of confidential medical documents.  Our staff is regularly trained on our practices to protect patient information, she said. There are multiple protocols in place for confidential information, and thats really all I can say because its currently under investigation.  Wood believes that the case is being taken seriously.  I dont go to that particular clinic, but the Samaritan doctors I do go to are truly amazing, and I totally trust in their service and professionalism, she said. I believe theyll get to the bottom of this; I really do. Hopefully that was the only time that it happened.

The Crown wanted a  $7,500 fine for Colbourne, but Howe settled on the lower fine because Colbourne did not share any of the information with anyone, and it wasn't medical charts or health records, but just names and billing addresses obtained.

""I particularly appreciated the thoughtfulness with which she [Judge Howe] addressed the breach of privacy and the impact it can have on people,"" said Khaladkar.  Colbourne did not appear in court.

Although we have no evidence that your PHI was inappropriately used, we are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to inform you of this incident in writing. We also want to assist you by providing you with the steps that you can take to protect yourself from any harm that may result from this incident. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: By way of background, HHC has implemented an information governance and security program that, among other things, monitors and detects all email communications that contain PHI and other confidential information that are sent outside of HHC's information systems without proper authorization. The incident in question, which occurred on January 15, 2015, was discovered on March 31, 2015 when, in the course of HHC's monitoring of outgoing emails, we identified an email that contained PHI, including yours, which a Metropolitan employee improperly sent from his HHC email account to his personal email account. While there is no indication that the employee improperly used the information contained in the email, its transmission was unauthorized and certainly not condoned by Metropolitan. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and advising you of the actions that we have taken and the ones that we recommend you consider taking to protect yourself from any possible adverse effects that could arise as a result of this incident. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH: Metropolitan has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, we interviewed the responsible Metropolitan employee and examined his HHC email account to ensure that we identified all the sites to which the email and spreadsheets were sent. We also reviewed the employee's personal email account, and were present to ensure that the employee deleted the email and spreadsheets from his personal email account. Second, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year.

According to the hospital, Parks was employed as a part-time patient care tech for less than one year, but she has since been terminated. Parks main duties were related to daily living such as skin care, feeding, hygiene, mobility and personal needs.  According to police, it all started when a woman was hospitalized and later contacted by her credit card company inquiring about some suspicious transactions. Detectives worked with hospital personnel to learn other patients staying at the hospital also had credit cards stolen from their personal belongings. Police believe there are at least 2 other victims.  Sgt. John Row with the Round Rock Police Department says, Credit card abuse is pretty ramped right now especially right around Christmas time and with the elderly.

Marie woman is angry, emotionally distraught and considering legal action over the fact her mothers medical records were inappropriately accessed by an employee of Sault Area Hospital (SAH).  The woman, who prefers to remain anonymous, has told SooToday.com a letter she received from Sonia Tassone, freedom of information and privacy coordinator at SAH, dated April 2, 2014, informs her that a March 31, 2014 audit of the hospitals MediTech system shows her mothers files were inappropriately accessed by an SAH employee.  A follow up letter, dated April 23, 2014, tells the woman her mothers medical records were accessed March 22, 2010, one full year after her mother passed away in March 2009.  The letter informs her that this was done outside the scope of the employees regular duties or job functions.  The letter states information in regards to the patients recent and past visits to SAH, name, date of birth, address, telephone number and Ontario health card number were inappropriately checked.  SAH announced in mid-April an employee had committed 144 inappropriate cases of accessing patient files using the MediTech system, dating back to 2008.  Many SAH staff, such as doctors, nurses, lab technicians and others, have access to medical records but access is restricted to those staff members directly involved in a particular patients case.  Letters were sent out from SAH to patients advising them of the breach, informing them that the SAH staff member involved (who has not been identified by SAH) has been fired, and that there was no reason to believe personal information had been shared.  The woman, as next of kin, who spoke to SooToday.com, showed us the original letter dated April 2, 2014, which states We have no reason to believe the documentation pertaining to you (or, in this case, the individuals mother) was used or reproduced and do not believe there will be any harm or impact to you.  Ron Gagnon, SAH president and CEO, told us it is a breach of confidentiality, which is a non-starter in this organization.  Based on the extent of our review were confident the information has not been passed on, Gagnon said.  We do many things to educate and keep our staff informed, anybody who works here what is required (in regards to confidentiality) its one of our key promises to our patients and were going to always, always, always act swiftly and take the same type of action that we took (dismissing an employee who violates confidentiality rules).  The fired SAH employee is appealing the termination of employment.  Meanwhile, the woman who contacted us said I was upset when I read the letter.  The woman remains concerned her mothers information may have been passed on and shared with others.  The more I thought about it, I started wondering if people have accessed her information and what theyre doing with it, she said.  Cant health card numbers be copied down by pen and paperI dont see where the hospitals confidence is.  I find it flippant and insulting for the hospital to say the employee was being nosyhow do they know for certain the employee was just being nosy (and did not pass the information along)?  What was the motivation (of the SAH employee) to do this?  My mother had cancer twice and beat it and she died from ALS which is a horrible diseaseshes now in her grave, she should be left alone, the woman said.  She was an extremely private person and I dont think she would have appreciated this.    Ottawa-based lawyer Michael Crystal is currently working on a $5 million class action lawsuit against the Peterborough Regional Health Centre concerning privacy breaches.  Crystal has been contacted by people affected by the SAH privacy breach and is inviting those affected to contact him at 613-794-1312 or 1-855-594-5490.  The woman we spoke to told us she has contacted Crystal, who will be visiting Sault Ste. Marie and holding an information meeting for those affected by the SAH privacy breach four to six weeks from now.  Well hear what he has to say and decide from there what we want to doIll go to the meeting and see what the lawyer has to say, she said.",http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/details.asp?c=72559

OCR launched the investigation in 2009, following complaints by two unnamed celebrities that their medical records had been compromised. The government probe revealed that from 2005 to 2008, ""unauthorized employees repeatedly looked at the electronic protected health information of numerous other UCLAHS patients,"" according to an OCR press release.  The Los Angeles Times reports that violations allegedly occurred at all three UCLAHS hospitals: Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center, and Orthopaedic Hospital and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital, which are regarded as a single unit.    The hospital had disclosed in April 2008 that it had discovered that several employees had snooped into the patient records of dozens of celebrities, including Britney Spears, Tom Cruise and Maria Shriver.  When the alleged violations came to light in 2008, the California legislature passed a law that imposed escalating fines on hospitals for patient privacy breaches. The state fined UCLAHS $95,000 in 2009, reportedly in connection with the medical records of the late Michael Jackson.  The UCLAHS settlement with OCR is much smaller than previous HIPAA settlements, including those involving CVS Caremark ($2.25 million) and Rite Aid ($1 million).  As part of its settlement, UCLAHS agreed to institute new security and privacy policies, improve employee training, take action against employees who violate privacy rules, and designate an independent monitor to oversee compliance.  In a statement, UCLAHS said, ""The UCLA Health System considers patient confidentiality a critical part of our mission of patient care, teaching and research.

The Kirkbride Center stated that a census sheet, which contained patients names, addresses, some Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and limited insurance or medical information, was found when the individual was arrested.  The healthcare data breach involves the information of 922 patients. However, Kirkbride added that the stolen documents were recovered and there has been no indication of a misuse of the sensitive data.  The theft occurred on certain dates in 2012 and 2013 and was discovered and reported to Kirkbride by the U.S. Attorneys office in August 2014, the statement explained. An investigation by Kirkbride confirmed the only certain paper reports for certain dates containing some patient data was stolen. Kirkbride cooperated fully with law enforcement. A suspect was identified, arrested, and recently tried.  In a separate statement, Kirkbride President and CEO Rose DiOttavio said that while it is still unsure how the individual obtained the sensitive documents, Kirkbride has modified its internal reports and policies to protect against future occurrences.  We want to express our sincere regret to the patients of our Center whose personal information was stolen from our facility, DiOttavio said. We immediately began an investigation as to how these documents may have been stolen from the facility.  The notification was delayed as a result of the law enforcement investigation.

The Colorado-based hospital allegedly gave Karen Billings seven pages of operating room records after her Nov. 22 hospital release, according to a Fox31 report.  Billings told the news station that along with her own discharge information, she had paperwork with protected health information (PHI) of other patients. The data included patient names, dates of birth, the doctors name, the procedure done, and the prescribed medication.Medical Record Privacy  I was shocked. I was mad. I was hurt that I had somebody elses information, Billings said.  I wouldnt want my stuff out there.  Billings added that when she was first leaving the hospital, she noticed extra paperwork with the information of other patients. Her doctor was mortified, according to Billings, and a nurse took her file and removed the records. However, when she looked at her file the next day, Billings said she found that there was still paperwork with other patients PHI.  The Medical Center did not reach out to affected patients, according to Fox31, until the station reached out to them and started asking questions. In a statement, the healthcare organization said that it takes the protection of patients private information very seriously.  We were made aware that one days surgery schedule was mistakenly given to a patient on November 22nd and, per policy, our Facility Privacy Official immediately began an internal investigation and we are notifying the affected patients, the statement read. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our patients and are reviewing internal procedures to determine additional safeguards we should implement.  Three individuals whose information was allegedly in the paperwork given to Billings spoke with Fox31. Each person said they were shocked that they were first notified by the media, rather than the Medical Center of Aurora.  If the doctor knew about it, the administrators knew about it, the hospital knew about it, then they shouldve been proactive instead of waiting, trying to hide it, Scott Anderson told the news station.  While it is not yet clear if a HIPAA violation took place, or what process The Medical Center of Aurora used, it is important to keep in mind what constitutes a breach and how healthcare organizations are required to notify individuals.  Individual notifications of a potential HIPAA violation must be given without reasonable delay and no later than 60 days after the discovery of a breach, according to the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). Media outlets are only required to be notified if the breach affects more than 500 state residents.  There are three exceptions to what constitutes a breach, according to HHS.  The first exception applies to the unintentional acquisition, access, or use of protected health information by a workforce member or person acting under the authority of a covered entity or business associate, if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and within the scope of authority.  Additionally, the inadvertent disclosure of PHI by an authorized individual to another person with authorized access at the covered entity or business associate would be an exception. Finally, it would not be considered a HIPAA breach if the covered entity or business associate has a good faith belief that the unauthorized person to whom the impermissible disclosure was made, would not have been able to retain the information.

Both sides worked very hard to get this resolved quickly, and to seek justice for all of those involved, plaintiff attorney Maureen Brady told the news source.  The patient records were placed in a dumpster without a lid, and during a particularly windy day, the papers were scattered up to several blocks away. Included on the pages were patients names, Social Security numbers, addresses, procedures and tests performed.  At Midwest Womens Healthcare we take patient privacy very seriously, a spokesperson said in an email to the news station back in May. We continue to thoroughly investigate this issue and will take appropriate action based on our findings. Midwest Womens Healthcare is in the process of determining which patients may have been affected and intends to notify them as soon as possible.  If the settlement is approved by a judge, patients whose PHI was compromised will receive letters with instructions on how to receive their settlements. However, it has not yet been determined if Midwest will also face fines from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) over possible HIPAA violations. Those fines could reach upwards of millions of dollars, according to the news station.  HHS fines could be an amount not less than $100 or more than $50,000 for each violation, and for situations specifically where it is established that the compromised information was due to willful neglect and was not timely corrected, will be $50,000 for each violation.  Its crucial for healthcare organizations to understand their personal responsibility when it comes to keeping patients data safe and ensuring there is no PHI exposure. Civil penalties from HIPAA violations, added to any compensation sought by potential victims could add up to crippling amounts. Moreover, it could take some time for a facility to once again prove that it is capable of handling sensitive information securely.  In the case of Research Medical Center, a spokesperson explained that there have been no reports that any of the compromised information was used improperly. The organization is also taking extra steps to enhance the security of patient information.  Proper disposal of medical records is unfortunately a common violation of patient privacy. Earlier this month, approximately 2,000 patients in Minn. were notified that their PHI was compromised after sensitive documents were placed in a dumpster.  Northfield Hospital and Clinics reportedly placed documents containing patients PHI in commercial dumpsters in error over an eight-day period in October. Those papers may have included patient names, account numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, types of treatment, insurance information and medical information. In a few cases credit card information might have also been included.",http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/12/04/phi-exposure-case-1500-patients-settled/

The healthcare provider does not believe any information was inappropriately viewed by any unauthorized individuals, but has proceeded with a breach response to ensure that all patients are aware of the incident to allow them to take precautions should they wish to do so.  Following the discovery, the hospital initiated an investigation to determine the data that could potentially have been exposed in the incident, and to find out if any information had been improperly accessed. That investigation did not cover any evidence of disclosure of PHI.  However, the possibility that data has been viewed by unauthorized individuals or has been copied cannot be eliminated, hence the issuing of breach notification letters.  1,801 Potential Affected by Health Data Breach 1,801 patients have potentially been affected by the breach. No financial information or Social Security numbers were in the data, but it did contain health information including the names of laboratory test results, the date that a patient had visited the center, and the test results themselves. The data was tied to the patient by their name and medical record number. The data is restricted to individuals that took a specific type of medical test between specific dates: August 2013 and March 26, 2014, who had visited one of the healthcare provider's Women's health and family practice clinician offices. The data breach was discovered on April 11, 2015.  According to the breach notice issued by PSHMC, the laboratory assistant had been give authorization to access PHI as this was required for work purposes. The employee had entered information from the laboratory results into a test log, and took it home to work on.  The employee's home system was outside of the control of the medical center, and potentially the information could have been exposed or viewed by external parties. That was not the only violation of hospital policy. PHI was copied onto a flash drive which was used to transfer the data from the hospital system to the employee's home computer. That information was then attached to a personal email account and sent  via an unencrypted network  to two different physicians.  In order to prevent future incidents from occurring PSHMC will be ""increasing education efforts with employees, focusing on the essential responsibility of all staff to safeguard patient health information at all times and follow proper practices for doing so.""  It is not known whether the employee in question had not received training on HIPAA Rules, did not understand the significance of the actions he took or if it was blatant disregard of hospital/HIPAA Rules. While this is in all likelihood was an isolated incident, it is one which could easily occur in hospitals all over the country.  This incident highlights the need for training on HIPAA rules, and reinforcement of data privacy and security rules periodically. A simple error of judgement could land both and employee and a healthcare provider in serious trouble. It is therefore essential that HIPAA Rules are not forgotten by the staff.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/penn-state-hershey-medical-center-announces-hipaa-breach-7092/; http://lancasteronline.com/news/local/hershey-medical-center-notifies-patients-of-data-breach/article_385c9ea2-edbb-11e3-9730-0017a43b2370.html

The incident affected patients at St. Peter's Medical Associates P.C., one of the system's physician groups. The manager's cellphone had access to corporate email systems, but St. Peter's officials said they received no reports that patient information has been improperly used. The affected data included scheduling details, such as the patient name and date of birth, as well as the day, time and location of medical appointments, along with a general description of the reason for the appointment. The breach primarily involved data from August to November 2014. The emails did not include other medical records and personal identity information, such as financial accounts and Social Security numbers. Two patients' home addresses and phone numbers were included in the emails and they were notified previously. Hospital officials said they learned of the phone theft and potential breach on Nov. 24. They reported it to law enforcement and took other cyber security steps, such as remotely wiping data from the device and disconnecting it from the hospital system's corporate email system.

Earlier this week, CBC News reported that boarded-up buildings near the Hillsborough Hospital, currently used to store some financial records and health records, have been broken into in recent weeks. Police say the buildings should be torn down. James Aylward says keeping personal health and financial records in an unsecured derelict building is wrong. ""It makes absolutely no sense to me in in this day and age, it's 2014. I mean, these buildings should have been torn down years ago. To house such important files as Islanders' health records and financial records, it makes absolutely no sense to me."" The PC MLA asks that the matter be referred to the privacy commissioner to investigate. Aylward is also calling on the province to contact all Islanders who have been the victims of what he calls ""a careless privacy breach."" Health PEI has been working on a plan for some time to move the files from the buildings, says Pam Trainor, executive director of acute care, mental health and addictions. But some of the older files have mould on them and so an environmental company was brought in to help. Trainor says some files will be moved to a secure location next week and some will be destroyed. ""There doesn't appear to be a breach. It appears that those accessing the building have been accessing it for shelter only. There is no evidence that they've been accessing the files,"" said Trainor.

Nurse- hacker Alters Hospital Prescriptions, Computer Audit Update (February 1, 1994), 1994 WLNR 3804526. Heres how the story described what Rymer did: A nine-year-old boy, suffering from meningitis was only saved from serious harm by a sharp-eyed ward sister. She spotted that the youngster's prescription had been altered the previous day to include drugs used to treat heart disease and high blood pressure and an investigation was immediately launched.  It was then discovered that . . . Rymer had also secretly used the computer system at Arrowe Park Hospital . . . to prescribe anti -biotics to 70-year-old Kathleen Wilson, a patient on a geriatric ward. She had been given the drug, but had suffered no adverse reaction.  Rymer, described as obsessed with computers and high-tech equipment, had also accessed other records. He had scheduled a patient to have an unnecessary X -ray and recommended that another patient be discharged. Nurse-hacker Alters Hospital Prescriptions, supra.   Rymer was not charged with attempted murder but with unauthorized access to a computer that resulted in damage to data in the system. At trial, the prosecutor told the court that Rymer used a doctor's pin number to access the computer at the hospital. He had memorized the number five months earlier, after observing a locum doctor having trouble accessing the system. Rymer altered the prescription for the nine-year-old boy suffering from suspected meningitis, and prescribed a potentially toxic drug cocktail of Atenol, Temazepim, Bendroflumethiazide and Coproxomal. Nurse-hacker Alters Hospital Prescriptions, supra. According to the story, Rymer was unable to explain why he had altered the treatment records, but denied having any malicious intent. He had developed a fascination for computers . . . and had developed a lack of sensitivity to the consequences of his actions. Nurse-hacker Alters Hospital Prescriptions, supra.  The judge found Rymer guilty and sentenced him to a year in jail. And the hospitals executive nurse said tighter computer security was implemented to ensure this did not happen again. Nurse-hacker Alters Hospital Prescriptions, supra.  I assume Rymer wasnt charged with murder because there was no evidence that his purpose was to kill people; he may simply have been experimenting. Im not sure why he wasnt charged with manslaughter or whatever the analogous crime is under UK law. It seems to me if someone hacks into a hospitals prescription database and changes peoples prescriptions, that person could be held liable for recklessly causing their death if the altered prescriptions had a lethal effect. Recklessly means that the defendant was aware there was some risk death could result from what he was doing but ignored it, and proceeded to alter the prescriptions.",http://cyb3rcrim3.blogspot.com/2009/01/attempted-computer-murder.html

Petty, 52, appeared for arraignment with Texarkana attorney Thomas Johnson in the Texarkana Division of the Eastern District of Texas. Johnson entered pleas of not guilty on Petty's behalf to 22 counts of health care fraud and nine counts of aggravated identity theft.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Caroline Craven released the accused foot doctor on a $50,000 unsecured bond. Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Locker said the government does not oppose Petty's release but asked that Petty surrender his passport.  Craven set the case for jury selection Aug. 22 before U.S. District Judge Robert Schroeder, III. But that date is likely to change because Locker filed a motion asking that the case against Petty be given a complex designation because of the amount of documents and evidence which must be examined by both the prosecution and defense in preparation for trial.  Petty owns Community Foot Clinic, formerly Dr. Petty's Foot Clinic, on Summerhill Road in Texarkana, Texas, as well as Legacy Foot and Ankle in Frisco, Texas, according to the clinics' websites. A 31-count indictment issued Wednesday in the Texarkana division of the Eastern District of Texas accuses Petty of stealing more than $150,000 from U.S. taxpayers from September 2010 to January 2013 through fraudulent Medicare billing.  The indictment's first 13 counts accuse Petty of billing Medicare for office visits and treatments using Health Insurance Claim Numbers of people who were dead at the time he allegedly saw them in Dr. Petty's Foot Clinic. Some of the patients had been deceased for more than a year and some just a week or two when Petty allegedly submitted claims for services rendered following their dates of death.  Four counts accuse Petty of billing Medicare for physical therapy when in reality all the patients received were written or verbal instructions on how to exercise at home. Five counts allege Petty billed Medicare for ""electronic stimulation treatments"" that were performed with a non-approved device called a MicroVas. Those counts further allege the MicroVas treatments were administered by clinic staff and Petty's teenage son who were not qualified to deliver services reimbursable by Medicare. The indictment's last nine counts accuse Petty of aggravated identity theft on multiple dates in 2011 and 2012.  A notice of forfeiture in Petty's indictment spells out the government's intent to acquire a $157,660 judgment against Dr. Petty.  Each of the 22 counts of health care fraud is punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. Each of the nine counts of identity theft carries a mandatory two-year federal prison sentence which ""is to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed.

Appearing at West Hampshire Magistrates today, Marcia Phillips was prosecuted under section 55 of the Data Protection Act and fined 750 and ordered to pay a 15 victim surcharge and 400 prosecution costs.  Ms Phillips was found to have accessed the information on 15 separate occasions over a 16-month period while working as a receptionist at the Bath Lodge Practice. The breach became apparent after Phillips left her job and sent a text message to her ex-husbands partner referring to highly sensitive medical information taken from her medical record.  Deputy Commissioner and Director of Data Protection, David Smith, said:  This case clearly shows the distress that can be caused when an individual uses a position of responsibility to illegally access sensitive personal information. Ms Phillips knew she was breaking the law, but continued to do so in order to cause harm to her ex-husbands new wife.  The nature of her job meant that she will have been in no doubt as to the importance of patient confidentiality. Despite this she repeatedly accessed the victims file without a valid reason.  Unlawfully obtaining or accessing personal data is a criminal offence under section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998. The offence is punishable by way of a fine of up to 5,000 in a Magistrates Court or an unlimited fine in a Crown Court. The ICO continues to call for more effective deterrent sentences, including the threat of prison, to be available to the courts to stop the unlawful use of personal information.  David Smith added:  We continue to urge the Government to press ahead with the introduction of tougher penalties to enforce the Data Protection Act.

The laptop contained patient names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, medical record numbers, and health insurance plan providers on 3.3 million patients who used Sutter Physician Services, a provider of billing services for healthcare providers.  The affected healthcare providers include Albany Family Practice, various Alta Bates medical facilities, Central Valley Medical Group, County of Yolo Department of Health, Eden Medical Center, Family Doctor Medical Group, Oakcare Medical Group, San Leandro Hospital, and various Sutter Health facilities.  The laptop contained additional information on 943,000 patients of Sutter Medical Foundation (SMF), including dates of service and medical diagnoses and procedures. Patients who were seen by the facility between January 2005 and January 2011 are affected.  Because the data of SMF patients was broader in scope, SMF has begun the process to notify these patients by mail. Patients should receive letters no later than Dec. 5, 2011, Sutter Health said.

Multiple sources told The Observer Monday as many as 17 people were dismissed after non-clinical staff accessed patient information through a password-protected system  without authorization  earlier this month.  Sources told The Observer that at least part of the information accessed is related to the persons charged in the murder of 27-year-old Sarnia teacher Noelle Paquette.  Karen Waymouth, chief information and privacy officer, said she couldn't confirm whether employees were fired, citing the privacy and confidentiality of the investigation.  We do uphold a policy of confidentiality here and that we do have a policy in place if a breach occurs, she said. The appropriate action was taken.  Waymouth did not divulge specifics  what information was accessed, how many people were affected, what type of non-clinical staff were involved, or what they were doing with the information.  It's due to the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals, the people who's charts were accessed, and also the staff that were involved, she said.  Staff had access to the computer system because of their jobs at Bluewater Health, Waymouth said. The breach was confirmed after a random audit and employee interviews.  She did say fewer than 17 staff members were involved in the breach, but wouldn't confirm the exact number.  Waymouth contacted patients affected by the breach personally and apologized, she said, noting their reactions, when she called, were of disappointment.  The police were not notified, she said, but Bluewater Health was planning to contact the Information and Privacy Commission.  Mandatory orientation sessions at Bluewater Health cover privacy and confidentiality, and require employees, physicians, volunteers and students to sign a pledge of confidentiality  enforced by hospital policy and law, Bluewater Health officials said in a news release.  Patient confidentiality and patient care are part of a balancing act when it comes to personal information, Waymouth said.  Unauthorized or inappropriate access to electronic patient information is viewed with zero tolerance.  Staff are planning to re-educate all staff, students, volunteers and physicians about Bluewater Health's policy, she said, adding hospital officials do value and trust staff.  It's disappointing when a policy is not followed and we're unable to fulfill our obligation to protect patient privacy, she said.  This is the second time in recent years that Bluewater Health has reported a security breach.  In November 2010, 123 Bluewater Health patients' personal health records were breached by an employee at the West Lambton Community Health Centre, resulting in changes to auditing practices and staff access levels at both organizations.",http://www.theobserver.ca/2013/01/28/privacy-breach-at-bluewater-health

(A Psychological Corporation), based in Los Angeles, recently notified the California Attorney Generals Office of a breach involving patient scheduling information.  According to their July 17th letter to patients, submitted to the state on July 25, some patient scheduling information located in their computerized system had been viewed via an unsecured webpage by two non-ManagedMed people.    ManagedMed learned of the breach on May 13 and launched an immediate investigation that revealed that from approximately March, 2013 through May 15, 2014, it was possible for unauthorized individuals to access the calendaring system in certain circumstances.  Seth Hirsch, PhD, President of ManagedMed, informed patients that An individual who knew the website address for the calendaring system could access patient scheduling information for the period between November 1, 2010 through May 15, 2014. In addition, with respect to a limited number of patients, it was possible for an unauthorized person to access the ManagedMed calendaring system by performing a Google search of a patients name and then clicking on a link to the calendaring system website.  Information in the calendaring system included patients names,  telephone numbers, names of care providers, limited notes, and the date of the appointment. In certain cases, Dr. Hirsch wrote, the notes contain abbreviations about the general type of visit scheduled, for example f/u (follow up),  i/e (initial examination) or notes about medication or a test the patient was scheduled to take.  Considering that this is a mental health facility, exposure of such information could be somewhat embarrassing or problematic.  No Social Security numbers or drivers license numbers were accessible via the calendaring system and it was not possible to access patients actual medical records, which are not maintained on a computer, Dr. Hirsch explained.  The calendaring system was secured on May 15, and other than the two individuals who accessed it without authorization on May 13, ManagedMed is not aware of any other access to the system or any misuse of information.  No services were offered to the patients and they were given no advice. ManagedMed did apologize for the incident and reassure patients that the system was now secured.  You can read the notification here (pdf).  And no, this incident is not (yet?) up on HHSs public breach tool. Im wondering what they might do in this case as exposing information about patients at a mental health facility is pretty serious, even if only two people actually accessed the information.

The Shrewsbury Township resident stopped to pick one up and found a stack of personal medical records from a local doctor's office.  ""It shocked me,"" he said. ""Who would think it's OK to dump them there?""  Hill said he had worked for Johns Hopkins University where he spent some time implementing HIPAA regulations in computer software. He immediately felt he had to protect the files.  He wanted to alert the public, so he gathered up records from the ground  47 files  and gave them to the York Daily Record.  ""I wasn't sure what to do at first,"" he said. ""I didn't know if I should take them to the police. I finally thought, this is what news agencies are for.""  The York Daily Record contacted the Pennsylvania Department of State, which then asked for the files. The Daily Record gave them to an investigator. The department will review the documents as the first step in an investigation, according to Ron Ruman, press secretary with the state.  It is not known who delivered the local medical records found at the authority's dumpster, or how they got there.  The files bear the names of the York Academy of Surgery and Dr. R. Dale McCormick.  They contain personal medical information, doctors' notes, social security numbers and insurance information.  Some of the surgeries occurred at Memorial Hospital, according to the records. But a hospital spokesman said the records did not belong to Memorial.  Jason McSherry, community relations and marketing spokesman at the hospital, said York Academy of Surgery was a private practice.  ""It is normal practice for hospitals to securely share patient records related to care provided by the hospital with independent physicians on the medical staff to support the delivery of care to their patients,"" McSherry said. ""Once records have been provided to physicians, it is their responsibility to dispose of those records in a secure manner.""  Ruman said McCormick has an active osteopathic medical license.  Calls made to the practice on Eastern Boulevard in Springettsbury Township rang unanswered, and the office appeared vacant. Neighbors said they didn't know the last time they'd seen someone there.  Other attempts to locate the doctor or the practice were unsuccessful.  Rachel Seeger with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which handles HIPAA regulations, said it was the first they had heard of the incident and were unable to comment.  Ruman said he could not recall similar cases. Most of the cases the Department of State deals with involve patients who want access to paperwork after an office has closed.  According to the Health and Human Services website, medical officers ""are not permitted to simply abandon"" patient information or ""dispose of it in dumpsters or other containers that are accessible by the public or other unauthorized persons. However, the Privacy and Security Rules do not require a particular disposal method.""  Doctors are told to review their own policies and determine what steps are ""reasonable to safeguard"" patients.  The only time they may be dumped in trash receptacles is if the size of the files requires they be put in locked dumpsters accessible only to authorized people, according to the website.  Ruman added that the state requires offices to keep medical records for seven years, and that doctors are responsible for protecting patient information, but that the state does not regulate how the records must be destroyed.  Ellen O'Connor with the York County Solid Waste Authority said the area where Hill found the files is a public disposal location. The incinerator is on Blackbridge Road in Manchester Township.  Anyone can go there to dump waste, but O'Connor found it odd that someone ""would choose that level to get rid of documents.""  The waste authority has a confidential destruction program with most medical offices. In those cases, a representative from the office brings the files and either tosses them in the incinerator themselves, or watches someone do it, and then gets a certificate of their destruction.  By the time O'Connor was contacted for this story June 9, anything in those dumpsters would have been destroyed, and cleaning crews would have picked up debris on the ground, she said.",http://www.ydr.com/local/ci_25980746/private-medical-records-found-at-public-dumpster-manchester; http://www.ydr.com/local/ci_25988934

Sentencing is scheduled for January 15, 2015. At sentencing, Augustin faces up to five years in prison.  According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, in January 2012, an individual recruited into the scheme searched their employers database and accessed the names and Social Security numbers (personal identity information or PII) of individual medical patients. This employee then provided a list of individuals PII in exchange for a cash payment made by defendant Augustin. Augustin and his co-conspirators then caused false and fraudulent tax returns seeking refunds to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service using the PII that the conspirators had so obtained.  Defendant Barnard (13-20684-CR-COOKE), who was also involved in this conspiracy, was sentenced on July 23, 2014 to 36 months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay restitution of $57,000. Barnard pled guilty to one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1029(a)(3) and 2, and one count of aggravated identity theft, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028A(a)(1).  Mr. Ferrer commended the investigative efforts of IRS-CI and the USSS. These cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys James V. Hayes and Gera Peoples.

Cole, who was charged with providing the PII to Moshi Barnard, entered a plea in October.  The data theft and misuse occurred between December 2011 and January 2012.  Although the court records do not name the covered entity whose patient information was stolen, the governments filings noted that the case had been investigated by the Aventura Police Department, and that William Sims, Chief Security Officer, Memorial Healthcare might be called as a witness for the prosecution, so it appears that this was likely their patient information.

Nancy Serwo, acting administrator at the hospital, said two boxes of records were returned to the hospital on June 16 after they were discovered in a filing cabinet the hospital had donated elsewhere last year. The best estimate of when the equipment was disposed of is last October, Serwo said, though she could not identify who received it. The letter sent to patients states no one asked for identification from the person who returned the boxes to the hospital, which has made it difficult to investigate the breach. Serwo would not identify where the cabinets had been used in the hospital, saying it was a specific, isolated area. However, KTW spoke with one of the letter recipients, who provided a copy of the letter. The woman, upset her medical privacy had been breached, requested her name not be published. Her letter said her file involved in the breach included a diagnostic polysomnogram test result. A polysomnogram is a sleep-disorder test. The woman said her first reaction, when she was handed the registered letter from RIH, was to wonder if they were going to tell me they had infected me with something, a concern that harkens back to a few years ago, when RIH patients received letters advising them of sterility issues during invasive procedures they had undergone. The mailman said all he knew is they were delivering hundreds of them all over the city, she said, adding she wants more assurance about who might have read her file, which included her name, date of birth, personal health number and other health information. I dont know who they gave it to. I dont know who might have rifled through it. Serwo said she took possession of the boxes on June 16 and was confident, after inspecting them, that they had not been read beyond identifying they were medical records and needed to be returned. But, Serwo added, she understands her confidence might not be enough to remove any worries from those 1,628 patients. Serwo said anyone who has additional questions or needs more information can call the IHA patient-care quality office in Kelowna at 1-877-442-2001, or send an email to patient.concerns@interiorhealth.ca. The woman who spoke to KTW also wondered how a cabinet full of files could have been moved without someone noticing it was not empty. Ive done it, she said. Theyre heavy. Serwo said she had no answer to that question, but added that last October, during a regular policy review, the relevant policy had been amended to clarify manages responsibilities when disposing of excess equipment. The letters spell out what could be called the worst-case scenario of identity theft and what people should do to ensure their information isnt used illegally. However, Serwo said, that is because the hospital wanted to exercise an abundance of caution. The measures it refers to include having an alert placed on their health number that would prompt confirmation of the cardholders identity when the card is used. A similar alert can be placed on patients credit ratings. In addition, patients were advised to review their bank and credit-card statements to ensure all transactions were valid. So, now I have to go back through a years worth of bank documents? the letter recipient asked. It is not a comfortable thing to know this happened. Serwo said the one-month time span between having the documents returned and advising patients of the privacy breach was due to Interior Health Authority policy that requires a review of what happened and to ensure appropriate action is taken to avoid a similar breach in the future. This was challenging given the circumstances involved in this case, IHA communications officer Michaela Swan said. While that was ongoing, staff reviewed the more than 1,700 documents involved to identify all patients who had information in the documents. After that step, staff had to manually search each patients records for their contact information and to verify their age. If they are under 18, parents or guardians needed to be contacted. For those under care, care providers had to be contacted. The IHA also had to determine if the patients are still alive. With the number of people involved, Swan said, the process took some time to complete.",http://www.theprovince.com/health/patients+privacy+breached+when+medical+records+were+donated+along+with+filing+cabinet/10094645/story.html?__federated=1; http://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/1628-patients-at-kamloops-hospital-had-privacy-breached/

Franciscan estimates more than 12,000 patients nationwide had files potentially breached.  Franciscans total of 8,300 patients potentially affected in the South Sound was the largest in the Catholic Health Initiatives network. CHI is the parent company of Franciscan.  The employees, most of them employed by Franciscan Medical Group, responded to late January phishing emails that appeared to be coming from CHI. Those messages, composed by computer hackers, not by CHI, asked Franciscan employees to go to another site where they were to enter their email user names and passwords.  While much of the information available to the scammers in the email accounts may have included routine biographical information on patients such as name, age, address and phone numbers, in some cases medical diagnoses and treatment plans also may have been included in the records exposed to the hackers.  Franciscan spokesman Scott Thompson said the phishing expedition was a nationwide effort targeting CHI health systems employees. Fewer than 20 Franciscan staff members responded to those email messages and entered their user names and passwords.  The health system, whose Puget Sound network includes St. Joseph Medical Center in Tacoma, St. Francis Hospital in Federal Way, Highline Medical Center in Burien, St. Elizabeth Hospital in Enumclaw, St. Clare Hospital in Lakewood, St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor and Harrison Hospital in Bremerton and dozens of clinics and specialty centers, said it froze those affected email accounts.  The health system hired computer forensic experts to determine the extent of the data breach and to track down the perpetrators. The medical system also enlisted the FBI and the Secret Service in the investigation.  The FBI declined to comment or to even confirm that it was investigating the matter, citing its longstanding policy of not discussing complaints or pending investigations.  The computer forensic experts spent the past two months compiling lists of those whose information was exposed to the outsiders and trying to identify the scammers.  The Franciscan spokesman said it took the health system two months to notify patients because some of the information contained in the compromised emails was fragmentary.  It took some time to put that information together with names and addresses, he said.  Washington law requires businesses or individuals who collect personal data to disclose any breach of security in which their data was reasonably believed to have been obtained by unauthorized persons.The disclosure of the data compromise to those affected shall be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.  Donn Moyer, State Department of Health spokesman, said the department is considering opening a complaint file based on the breach.  We have not been notified by Franciscan nor have we received any complaint from someone whose data might be involved, said Moyer in a statement.  Federal health information privacy laws similarly require medical entities to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.  No one has yet been arrested in the data theft. Investigators have traced the original phony emails to an IP address at a small California college, Thompson said.  Patients whose personal information was potentially compromised are receiving letters from Franciscan detailing the computer incident. Those among them whose Social Security numbers were in the data accessible to the hackers are being offered a year of free credit monitoring.  The health system has established a toll-free phone line for Franciscan patients who have questions about whether their personal information was available to the hackers. That number is 877-283-6556.  Thompson said the health system has not been notified of any incidents in which the stolen information was used to gain access to patients bank or credit accounts or to apply for new credit in their names.  The data thieves also targeted other CHI medical employees, including those of Louisville-based KentuckyOne Health and other smaller CHI health facilities across the country. Franciscan and KentuckyOne were the only health systems where more than 500 patients records were potentially exposed to outsiders, said the Franciscan spokesman.  Franciscan has retrained the employees who responded to the email phishing effort, and the health care concern will soon be rolling out a systemwide phishing prevention update for all of its employees, the health system spokesman said.  Franciscan Medical Group is committed to protecting patient privacy, and we deeply regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused our patients, said Betty Doyle, regional privacy officer for Franciscan.   Followup:   Update: The 12,000 number includes 3,500 patients of KentuckyOne, who have also posted a statement on their website:      KentuckyOne Health is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our patients personal information. Regrettably, this notice is about an incident involving some of that information.      On January 27, 2014, we learned that phishing emails were sent to a small group of KentuckyOne Health employees who responded to the emails thinking they were legitimate requests. When we learned of this, we immediately secured the affected email accounts and began an investigation, including hiring an outside forensics expert firm. We undertook a comprehensive review of the affected employees e-mail accounts, which concluded on March 24, 2014. This investigation confirmed that the emails contained patient information from Jewish Hospital, Frazier Rehab Institute, Saint Joseph Berea and Flaget Memorial Hospital, and may have included patient demographic information (for example, name, address, date of birth, telephone number) and clinical information (for example, treating physician and/or department, diagnosis, treatment received, medical record number, medical service code, health insurance information).",http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/03/31/3126217/phishing-e-mails-net-medical-records.html?sp=/99/261/; http://www.scmagazine.com/medical-staffers-fall-for-phishing-emails-data-on-8300-compromised/article/340590/; http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/front-range/englewood/privacy-breach-involving-englewood-health-organization

Mark Henry Newman, 54, formerly of Acorn Court, Upton, has been suspended for nine months by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) after he breached patient confidentiality and pursued an inappropriate business interest.    The disclosure of ""sensitive"" details was described as a ""deplorable breach of trust"" and was said to have caused the patient ""great distress"" as he had kept his illness a secret from his children for nine years.    Mr Newman, a registered mental health nurse, was sacked in January 2013 by the Countess of Chester Hospital Trust for gross misconduct after an internal investigation and the trust then referred the case to the NMC.    Mr Newman was accused of failing to uphold standards of professional behaviour by deliberately disclosing, to a member of the public, confidential information about a patient who attended the hospital for care.    He was further accused of abusing his position as a registered nurse with regard to personal commercial matters.    The NMC panel's report states the complainant, 'Patient A', was a patient of the sexual health clinic where Mr Newman provided support to him and his family from a ""clinical and personal perspective"" since his diagnosis from around 2002. Mr Newman continued to see Patient A in a professional setting at the clinic as a health adviser.    On August 14, 2012, Patient A submitted a written complaint to the Trust alleging that Mr Newman had disclosed his personal health condition to a mutual friend.  The report states: ""This caused great distress to Patient A as he had kept his condition from his children for a period of nine years.""    While not specified, the man's illness was ""likely to have caused some memory loss"", according to the report.    A further letter was received by the trust, at a later date, from the member of the public, Mr 2. Mr 2 alleged that he was told of Patient A's condition by Mr Newman, who in turn informed Patient A that he was aware of his condition having been told by Mr Newman.    Mr Newman denied the charges saying he would never have told Mr 2 about Patient A's condition.    The NMC panel, however, found Mr Newman had breached patient confidentality after Mr 2 stated that he was ""100 per cent"" certain that it was Mr Newman who told him of Patient A's health condition during a journey to Wrexham.    The panel said Mr Newman had become ""blas and careless with regards to his professional boundaries"".    In conclusion the panel said: ""We consider Mr Newman's actions in breaching the confidentiality of Patient A fell far below what we would expect of a registered nurse.    ""Mr Newman was in a very privileged position in that he had access to Patient A's personal details and records including sexual detail and had greater access to information about his health than Patient A himself would have done. The panel was of the view that to breach this confidentiality and abuse this trust was deplorable.    ""Mr Newman, in his actions found proved, failed to adhere to the fundamental tenets of the nursing profession as set out in the preamble to the Code and did not uphold the reputation of the profession.    ""The panel concluded that Mr Newman's behaviour fell far short of the standards expected of a registered nurse and his actions were sufficiently serious departures from acceptable practice to amount to misconduct.""    Mr Newman was suspended from nursing for nine months. He has not been working as a nurse since the allegations came to light in August 2012 and stated at the hearing he has no plans to return. If he wishes to he will have to pass a 'return to practice' course.    Mr Newman is currently working as a part time delivery driver and has moved away from the area.

The patient records from the Cavan Monaghan General Hospital group were found on waste ground in black bags, after they were first taken home by Dr Ogbonna Anoke, the Medical Councils fitness-to-practise committee was told yesterday. Dr Anoke was accused of taking home documents between January 1st and August 7th, 2010. He was also accused of failing to dispose of the material adequately and of leaving some behind in his home after he moved out. The hearing heard that documents included patient names, dates of birth, details of their illnesses, radiology reports and theatre waiting lists. In its judgment, the committee found Dr Anoke guilty of serious professional misconduct on the counts of failing to dispose of the records adequately and leaving some records behind, but did not consider the charge of taking the documents home to amount to serious professional misconduct. The inquiry was told that a journalist had discovered the medical documents on open ground in a housing estate at Swellan, Cavan town, on August 7th, 2010. Sandra Mac Liammoir told the inquiry that a lot of the documents mixed with household waste referred to Dr Anoke. She contacted Cavan County Council and the material was examined by litter management officer Gerry ORourke. He also found material including a boarding pass, personal letters and material from a debt collection agency, all of which referred to Dr Anoke. There were also clinical records from the hospital, including radiology and theatre reports which named patients and contained details of their treatments. He said the council did not pursue a prosecution, as it was understood that by then, he was outside the jurisdiction. The hearing was told Dr Anoke had told a hospital inquiry that he had vacated his home in June 2010 and had inadvertently left two bags of files there which had not been properly disposed of. Patients whose records were affected were contacted and the situation explained and Dr Anoke had apologised to them. The Medical Council is expected to announce its sanction later.",http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2013/0212/1224329951036.html

But on Monday, personal information of several patients, who had been treated at the Midwest Womens Healthcare Specialists at Research Medical Center, ended up strewn across a neighborhood at 63rd Street and Prospect.  Witnesses said the medical records found in the field, came from Research Medical Center about a quarter mile from where they were found. FOX 4 spoke to one woman whose medical records were discovered in the field.  Honestly I am shocked, speechless and honestly just curious about how they came out of the doctors office and into public view, said the woman who did not want to be identified on camera.  A man FOX 4 spoke to, who also did not want to be identified, said he was driving along 63rd street on Monday around 2:00 p.m. And saw pink papers blowing across the street. He pulled over, saw they were medical records and traced them back to a dumpster behind research medical center where he could see them blowing out of the dumpster. 24 hours later FOX 4 located some more of them, still lying in a field.  FOX 4 located the womans contact information off the medical records and gave her a call, reading off her personal information to her.  How did you get my number? Very confused, shocked and speechless, said the woman when asked what she thought at the time of the call.  A spokesperson for Research Medical Center acknowledged the issue and directed FOX 4 to a representative from the Midwest Womens Healthcare Specialists, who as of Tuesday issued the following statement.  At Midwest Womens Healthcare we take patient privacy very seriously. We continue to thoroughly investigate this issue and will take appropriate action based on our findings.  Midwest Womens Healthcare is in the process of determining which patients may have been affected and intends to notify them as soon as possible.  FOX 4 asked the woman about what her expectations of privacy were at the time she went into the doctors office and signed all of the paperwork.  That my information would be kept private. That it would be secured with the hospital, and the doctors office, with the nurses. Thats a breach of confidentiality, she said. I was assured at the moment and very apprehensive at the time.  In fact, patient privacy is a federal law. The Office for Civil Rights enforces those laws, called the HIPPA Privacy Rules, which protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information.  A healthcare provider who violates a patients privacy rights under HIPPA is facing not only civil penalties by the government but criminal penalties as well, said Maureen Brady, of McShane & Brady, Attoneys at Law. That is why HIPPA is enacted. These healthcare providers are entrusted with your most private information, the information about your body, the information about your mind.  Attorney Maureen Brady says that criminal penalties for HIPPA violations can be as much as $50,000 for each violation can also carry prison time.

Boxes of records containing the personal details of patients were discovered at the Narre Warren South site when the shed at the Amberley Park Drive property was broken into in November 2013.  Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim investigated and found the medical centre that owned the property had breached the Privacy Act by failing to properly secure the information.  The neglected files included names, addresses, Medicare numbers, dates of birth, occupations and results of medical investigations of about 960 patients who used the Amberley Park Medical Centre that operated at the address until April 2011. Most of the records related to patients who visited the centre prior to 2004.  The owners of the property now run Pound Road Medical Centre in Narre Warren South.  Mr Pilgrim found the medical centre had failed to take reasonable steps to secure the sensitive medical records and had also failed to de-identify or destroy the information that it no longer used.  The investigation found the medical centre computerised patient records after November 2004 but that hard copy records were also kept in a locked room on the site.  The paper files remained inside the building for about 18 months after the Amberley Park Medical Centre shut until renovations began at the site and the files were moved to the garden shed, which was secured with three padlocks.  Pound Road Medical Centre told the Commissioner during its investigation that it had not realised the documents included ""some health records"".  A practice manager at Pound Road Medical Centre told Fairfax Media she did not wish to comment on the investigation.  The Commissioner found Pound Road Medical Centre should have known that the information included sensitive personal and health information and that there were no circumstances under which it would have been reasonable to keep such records in a garden shed, particularly when the property was unused.   The Pound Road Medical Centre has agreed to undertake a risk assessment regarding the way it manages personal information, review its privacy policy, organise privacy training for staff, and develop a data breach repsonse plan.","http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/medical-centre-in-narre-warren-south-breached-privacy-laws-by-keeping-files-in-shed-20140715-zt7qw.html; http://www.itnews.com.au/News/389686,medical-records-discovered-in-garden-shed-after-robbery.aspx?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=editors_picks"

Often discussed on this website is the importance of healthcare organizations  and facilities that store individuals healthcare information  must have the necessary HIPAA administrative safeguards in place. Combined with technical and physical safeguards, organizations have a much greater chance at keeping patients protected health information (PHI) secure.  However, when a facility has lax or outdated security measures, it can be difficult to monitor who is accessing certain systems. When that happens, former employees can log into an online database and potentially extract sensitive data, such as PHI or financial records.  Such is the case with the Early Learning Coalition of Palm Beach County. A breach occurred at the Belle Glade office of Family Central, Inc.The Florida facility recently announced on its website that a former employee accessed the electronic database that manages the personal information of individuals applying for or receiving services from the coalition.  The security breach compromised the personal information of individuals whose data is contained in the system, including parents and children residing in Palm Beach County who have received school readiness services or participated in the Voluntary Prekindergarten Education Program, the statement read.  Spokeswoman Tara Laxer told a local CBS affiliate that 177 people are currently known to have affected by the data breach. However, there could be more victims. The former employee had access to more than 230,000 identities through a statewide information system, the news source reported. Moreover, 110,000 of those records had valid Social Security numbers.  The breach occurred when an employee accessed the database in an unauthorized manner in order to obtain the personal information, including social security numbers, of individuals contained in the database, explained the statement. The employee is no longer employed by Family Central.  State and federal officials are currently investigating the incident, Family Central stated. Individuals whose information was known to have been compromised are being notified via email. However, people who have received services from the organization are encouraged to carefully monitor their credit history and enroll for free fraud alerts with one of the three major credit agencies. Family Central has not yet reported that they will offer any free credit services to those potentially affected by the data breach.  Family Central has implemented additional security measures including expanded security training for all employees, further restricting access to the information system and revising data security policies, the statement said.  Another key thing for organizations to remember is that all third-parties must be aware of the potential privacy risks, and implement the proper security measures to keep data safe. Just last week a New York health insurer had to notify Medicare subscribers that a subcontractor mishandled their PHI. As previously reported, the third-party vendor had a computer coding error, which caused denial letters to be sent to the wrong members. The compromised data included patients names, addresses, member ID numbers and general descriptions of the procedures.",http://www.cbs12.com/news/top-stories/stories/vid_21310.shtml; http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/data-security-breach-reported-in-palm-beach-county/njRb3/; http://cbs12.com/news/top-stories/stories/local-security-breach-compromises-peoples-information-21310.shtml; http://www.phiprivacy.net/fl-early-learning-coalition-of-palm-beach-county-announces-breach-at-family-central-inc/; http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/12/15/personal-data-of-200000-compromised-by-former-employee/

Gabby Klotzman started working for APS Marketing Group in Flatbush in April and almost immediately noticed faxes meant for Quest Diagnostic coming into her office, she says.  The faxes were all medical papers, with sensitive information, including name, date of birth, phone numbers, and sometimes social security numbers for patients. They almost always included the type of the test that was being ordered for the individuals and were faxed from many different medical offices in the New York metropolitan area. ""I know if it was my information being shared, I would want someone to tell me,"" Klotzman said.  Klotzman called Quest Diagnostics. She said the company told her they were handling the situation and promised her they would contact the clients. But the faxes kept coming. Klotzman noticed that Quest's fax number began with area code 785 while her company fax number began with a 718. She contacted the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees HIPAA, a collection of strict medical privacy laws.  Months went by and she continued to receive sensitive medical data she did not want. That's when she reached out to the I-Team. Hundreds of patients had medical documents with their information sent to the marketing group in error. The I-Team showed personal records to several of them. Key Witness in 'Grid Kid Slayer' Murder Trial Admits Lying Doralis Garcia was stunned to see her name, date of birth, age, phone number and type of testing she had undergone at a medical office in the Bronx. ""It is unbelievable and upsetting to know that you have my information,"" said Garcia.  Jason Price was equally shocked when the I-Team showed him a similar document bearing his name. ""This is definitely a violation of privacy,"" Price said. ""To give out someone else's medical records ... you don't know what people can do with this.""  Pam Dixon, a medical privacy expert, said it's against the law to send medical documents to a business. Klotzman followed up with the Department Health and Human Services about her complaint after several months of continuously getting the medical records. HHS sent her a letter in response, saying that the case was closed and that they would resolve the matter by providing ""technical assistance to Quest Diagnostics.""  When the I-Team contacted the medical office in the Bronx that sent Garcia and Price's information in error to the Brooklyn firm, the office said 44 records were sent to the wrong party due to ""human error when the area code was entered incorrectly."" The medical office was never notified by Quest Diagnostics or the federal government that something had gone wrong.  A spokesman for Quest Diagnostics says it was not aware that the breach involved so many medical documents from so many medical offices at the time Klotzman first contacted the company. Once the I-Team got involved, Quest decided to create a new 718 fax number to avoid future confusion with the medical offices in the metropolitan area.  Meanwhile, the I-Team has learned a class action lawsuit over the data breach was filed this week against Quest Diagnostics by the law firm Newman Ferrara LLP.

There are conflicting reports on the scope, in terms of the involvement of a business associate (BA), and time line of the data breach.  According to 14news.com, the medical practice, located in Owensboro, KY, the breach occurred three years ago and Director of Research for Owensboro Medical Practice, Timothy Hillard said he was aware of the incident.Even if it was one patient, that one patients information is highly important to us and not the entire medical records were taken but demographics such as name, date of birth, age, social security number, which is, you know, very concerning to us. The report also states that Owensboro thinks employees used the data to contact patients in efforts to start their own businesses.  Compromised information includes patient names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and health conditions.  However, there are some inconsistencies between the 14 News report and the Owensboro Medical Practice and its BA, Research Integrity, breach notification, which was also posted by PHIPrivacy.net. First, the notice says Owensboro Medical Practice learned of the breach on July 24, 2014 and not three years ago. And, as stated by PHIPrivacy.net, its still unclear from the notice how the organization or the BA discovered the breach in July.  On or about July 24, 2014, Owensboro Medical Practice, PLLC, and its business associate, Research Integrity, LLC, learned that a spreadsheet containing protected health information was wrongfully copied and removed from the offices of Research Integrity by a former employee. This occurred despite the fact that only properly authorized persons at Research Integrity had access to the spreadsheet. Owensboro Medical Practice believes the data was only used for research purposes by one of Research Integritys competitors and not for malicious activity.  Owensboro Medical Practice and Research Integrity are both investigating the incident and taking steps to ensure that patient information is secure. The companies are also pursuing the return of all hard copies of all information from the spreadsheet, the deletion of all computerized versions of such information on a permanent basis, and permanent injunctions against the persons or entities who had possession of the data from utilizing such data in the future. Because this was a HIPAA violation, Owensboro has alerted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about the breach, but any details of talks with HHS were not disclosed.",http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/09/24/medical-practice-notifies-3000-patients-of-data-breach/; http://www.14news.com/story/26609328/data-breach-at-owensboro-medical-practice; http://drvora.com/Public%20Notice%20MI.pdf

Mount Sinai Hospital confirmed Thursday that a pair of employees who are not part of Mr. Fords treatment team accessed his health records.  We became aware of this activity through a robust system of safeguards and auditing procedures designed to ensure compliance to our security and privacy policies, Sally Szuster, the manager of communications and public affairs at Mount Sinai, said in an e-mailed response to questions. We immediately investigated and appropriate action has been taken, as per our strict code of conduct and privacy policies.  She said the mayor has been notified of the breach, something that is required under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, the provincial legislation that safeguards patients medical records.  Ms. Szuster would not say what punishment, if any, the employees received, what jobs the employees hold or held at the hospital, or when Mr. Fords records were accessed.  We sincerely regret that these privacy breaches occurred, she said.  The mayor became one of Mount Sinais highest-profile patients when he was transferred to the hospital on Sept. 11 with a large and, at that time, unexplained abdominal mass.  Mount Sinais doctors diagnosed the mayor with liposarcoma, a rare, malignant tumour that arises in fatty tissue. He has since undergone two courses of chemotherapy at Mount Sinai in a bid to shrink the tumour.  Mr. Fords ill health forced a massive shake-up in the Toronto election campaign. He dropped out of the mayors race, put his name on the ballot for his old council seat in Etobicoke, and urged his followers to throw their support to his older brother Doug, who joined the mayoral contest an hour before the deadline to sign up.  The elder Mr. Ford said Thursday night that he has not spoken to the mayor about the privacy breach at Mount Sinai, but he praised the care his brother has received there.  They did a lot of good things for Rob and millions of others over the years, Doug Ford said as he arrived at a mayoral debate. They have a very capable CEO, a very capable chief of staff for the doctors. I know they will handle it appropriately. I know they will do the right thing.  Brian Beamish, Ontarios acting information and privacy commissioner (IPC), said it is difficult to say how often hospital staff violate the rules by looking at the private medical records of patients they are not treating.  We dont have specific numbers on how often this happens, Mr. Beamish said by e-mail. [The] Personal Health Information Protection Act requires hospitals to notify patients of breaches. There is no requirement to contact the IPC. However, it has become a best practice to do so prior to patient notification. Anecdotally, inappropriate access by staff occurs more than we would like.  This is not the first privacy breach at a Toronto hospital to make the news this year. In June, it emerged that two former employees at Rouge Valley Health System in Scarborough allegedly provided the personal information of thousands of patients, mostly new parents, to companies marketing registered education savings plans.  Michael Crystal, the Ottawa lawyer who is spearheading a class-action lawsuit against Rouge Valley and two other hospitals where privacy breaches are alleged to have occurred, said that in his experience, hospitals tend to terminate employees who snoop in patient files.  In these types of cases, the employees are typically fired, Mr. Crystal said.",http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/10/16/mayor_rob_fords_privacy_breached_hospital_says.html; http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-hospital/article21123503/?cmpid=rss1

DENT called those 200 mistaken recipients on Monday night and asked them to erase the Excel spreadsheet that held the data and followed that with the letter to the 10,000 patients.

In September 2011 a resident of Simferopol filed a claim against a medical worker who disclosed confidential information about the HIV status of her child. A boy, who was adopted by the claimant, went to school only for a few weeks when his mother noticed he was reluctant to go to school and became withdrawn. The woman learned that the boys classmates humiliated and insulted him on the account of his diagnosis. She later discovered that one of the parents who worked as a nurse in the orphanage from where the child was adopted told parents that the boy was HIV-positive.  Adults told their children not to make friends with the ailing boy. Classmates humiliate the boy, teachers understated his grades and none of the pupils wanted to sit with him at the same desk. The boy was seriously stressed and psychologically scarred. At the end of 2012 the criminal case was brought to court, but the defendant failed to show up and dragged out the case.  On January 21 the court found the woman guilty of  disclosure of the results of medical examinations for HIV or other incurable diseases. The court banned the woman from being employed as a medical worker and pay a fine of UAH 1,700 for her infraction. The Interior Ministry noted that this was the first such case in Ukraine solved in favor of the claimant.

The security breach affects patients of a number of different healthcare providers.  The security breach was discovered when suspicious activity was detected on its network on August 15, 2016. Access to the system was rapidly shut down and a third party computer forensics firm was hired to conduct a thorough analysis of its systems to determine whether any protected health information had been accessed or copied.  Integrity Transitional Hospital receives laboratory specimens from a number of companies working on behalf of healthcare providers and submits those specimens to laboratories for testing. The investigation revealed a system used to store data relating to those services and billing was compromised and the protected health information of patients could potentially have been viewed. While data access was possible, no reports of data misuse have been received by the hospital in the two months since the breach was detected.  A range of patient data were stored in the system including names, laboratory test results and other testing information, health insurance details, and scanned driver's licenses. No Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or financial information were compromised.  Patients were notified of the privacy breach by mail on October 14 and have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for a period of one year without charge. Patients have been advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft.  The data breach has prompted Integrity Transitional Hospital to conduct a full security review. Additional data security measures will now be implemented to ensure that all laboratory information held by the hospital is better protected in the future.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/integrity-transitional-hospital-learns-of-data-breach-3634/; https://www.scmagazine.com/30k-affected-in-texas-hospital-breach/article/571585/

The hacking attack was detected by the billing vendor on December 3  and the employee's username and password were shut down the same day. Upon notice of the incident, Sacred Heart, in cooperation with the billing vendor, immediately launched a thorough investigation into the matter. Sacred Heart engaged computer forensics experts who were able to conduct an analysis of what information was included in the affected email account. After careful review, Sacred Heart was able to determine that the billing vendor's employee email account contained personal information for approximately 14,000 individuals. The personal health information in the email account included patient names, date of service, date of birth, diagnosis and procedure, billing account numbers, total charges, and physician name. Approximately 40 individuals' social security numbers were also compromised. The hackers did not gain access to individual medical records or billing records.

The thief made off with health information of about a dozen families that had been left in a locked case inside a bag with the laptop.  ""It's definitely something that is of concern to us,"" Dr. Christopher Mackie, medical officer of health for London and Middlesex County, said Tuesday.  The medical notes were for mothers attending baby clinics to get help for issues ranging from checking their babies' weights to overcoming challenges with breast feeding, he said.  ""It is not believed that the loss of this information could result in any significant harms to the client,"" he wrote in a report to the health board that meets Thursday.  Employees of the Middlesex-London Health Unit are prohibited from leaving medical records, paper or electronic, in their vehicles.  As to what has happened to the employee who left the files in a vehicle July 3, Mackie wouldn't disclose specifically what had been done but said that there had been followup.  The theft occurred in the farther of two employee lots from the health unit at 50 King St.  Mackie doesn't believe the thief was able to access files in the laptop because of a number of safeguards:  The health unit's practice is to encrypt all agency laptops. A username and password are needed to gain access to the device. Information technology staff were able to trace the laptop while it was connected to the Internet and wipe the data from it remotely. Health unit officials will send out notices to affected families and will contact Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner to inform them of the privacy breach.  The breach follows more notable alleged thefts reported this year:  The health records of Toronto Coun. Rob Ford were repeatedly breached in hospital while he battled cancer.  Criminal charges have been laid after a massive privacy breach at Scarborough's Rouge Valley Health System that saw the identities of new moms allegedly sold to a firm offering education investment vehicles.

I could find no statement on their website at that time. I still cant find one, but their report to the Maryland Attorney Generals Office provides the missing details.  On December 5, 2013, an employee at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hospital in Wellsboro, a Susquehanna Health affiliate, was responding to a routine request from an insurance carrier for claims information on their covered members. The employee, however, reportedly provided more information than what was required for covered members and also disclosed information on other patients who were not covered members of the insurance firm.  To make matters worse, all of the information was sent to the insurance firm via unencrypted e-mail. If youre keeping score, Id count that as three HIPAA violations right there.  But wait, it actually gets worse. Susquehanna Health did not learn of the breach until March 6 (they do not indicate how they learned of it), but when it started investigating it, it learned that the insurance company (Universal American) had forwarded (further released) the improperly shared data to its subcontractor,  iGATE, for data analysis. The information included patients names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, payment information, encounter identification numbers, physicians names, diagnostic codes, and patients employers.  In response to the breach, Susquehanna Health conducted extensive re-training of the employee and the entire department and indicated it would be making other changes.  Thankfully, the parties to whom the PHI was improperly released are themselves covered by HIPAA, so the risk of misuse of the information is relatively low. Despite that, Susquehanna did offer those affected free credit monitoring services for a year.

It all started when CBS 2 Investigator Dave Savini got a tip about what a dumpster diver found in the trash. Suburban Lung Associates has numerous offices affiliated with major hospitals. Charts belonging to their patients were just tossed in a dumpster. It is an identity thiefs dream, and a nightmare for patients. Medical files, tossed in the trash, contain personal information including drivers licenses, Social Security numbers and even medical histories. Diane and Guy Scarpelli are just two of thousands of people to have their identities put in jeopardy. I thought all this would be private, said Diane Scarpelli. It would never come out to anybody. I was shocked at first, said Guy Scarpelli. I didnt believe it. Filefax, a Northbrook company, stores and moves hospital records. CBS 2 found the company dumpster filled with medical records that should have been shredded or disposed of in a manner to protect patient privacy. There were even medical records left in a parked company car which could easily be read by anyone walking nearby. Filefax works for numerous medical facilities including Suburban Lung Associates, which is affiliated with Alexian Brothers Medical Center, Central DuPage Hospital, St. Alexius Medical Center, Edward Hospital, Northwest Community Hospital and Lutheran General Hospital. Its hard to believe they threw it in a dumpster, said Guy Scarpelli. Same thing happened with Keith Schuler. Details of his sleep study tossed in the trash along with his wifes personal information. Schuler said the records should have been shredded and could be used to steal his identity. Nice shopping spree on my dime, said Schuler. Also disturbed is Joe Sagerer. His daughter Holly died from her medical problems. He assumed her confidential file was safe which contained his Social Security number too. I thought it was all secure, said Sagerer. Its sad that it would go to that point. CBS 2 found a dumpster diver, selling paper for recycling, who says Filefax allowed her to take even more patient records a week earlier. She filled a tall blue garbage can up and made ten trips to a recycling facility with 1,000 pounds of even more Suburban Lung Associates files. No one from Filefax would answer the door, so CBS 2 called Northbrook police to secure the latest load of files in the dumpster. Police ordered the company to bring the dumpster inside. How long have they been doing it and how long have they been getting away with it? said Diane Scarpelli. The Illinois Attorney General and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services are investigating. Suburban Lung Associates is assisting the investigation and released the statement below. Filefax did not comment. Suburban Lung Associates Statement Re: Potential Compromise of Patient Information Suburban Lung Associates takes the privacy and security of our patients records very seriously. Upon learning that some information about previous patients may have been compromised as a result of actions by a third-party vendor, we immediately began an active investigation. We are working cooperatively with law enforcement to assess the situation. Based on what we know now, we believe this is an isolated incident involving patient records from 2004. We deeply regret these circumstances and are committed to keeping patients informed. Suburban Lung Associates, like many healthcare providers, relies on reputable third-party vendors to retain and, when appropriate, securely destroy patient records. Suburban Lung Associates policy with the vendor involved in this situation specifically mandates that all records be destroyed before they are discarded. We are investigating what may have occurred in this instance and are taking further steps to prevent a recurrence.",http://www.phiprivacy.net/il-medical-files-of-suburban-lung-associates-patients-found-in-filefax-dumpster/; http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/02/25/2-investigators-medical-files-with-personal-info-found-in-dumpster/

(Allergy Associates), has agreed to pay $125,000 to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and to adopt a corrective action plan to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. Allergy Associates is a health care practice that specializes in treating individuals with allergies, and is comprised of three doctors at four locations across Connecticut.  In February 2015, a patient of Allergy Associates contacted a local television station to speak about a dispute that had occurred between the patient and an Allergy Associates’ doctor. The reporter subsequently contacted the doctor for comment and the doctor impermissibly disclosed the patient’s protected health information to the reporter.  OCR’s investigation found that the doctor’s discussion with the reporter demonstrated a reckless disregard for the patient’s privacy rights and that the disclosure occurred after the doctor was instructed by Allergy Associates’ Privacy Officer to either not respond to the media or respond with “no comment.” Additionally, OCR’s investigation revealed that Allergy Associates failed to take any disciplinary action against the doctor or take any corrective action following the impermissible disclosure to the media.  “When a patient complains about a medical practice, doctors cannot respond by disclosing private patient information to the media,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “Because egregious disclosures can lead to substantial penalties, covered entities need to pay close attention to HIPAA’s privacy rules, especially when responding to press inquiries.”  In addition to the monetary settlement, Allergy Associates will undertake a corrective action plan that includes two years of monitoring their compliance with the HIPAA Rules.

This email was not sent by Mayfield. Mayfield notified recipients of the malicious email as soon as possible that same day, posted the information prominently on its website home page, and updated recipients again on February 25 with recommendations for remedy.  Mayfield has completed its review and is issuing a final communication to all recipients by letter and also by distributing a press release of the incident and Mayfield's response since that time.  As previously reported on WCPO TV in February, the email was generated by an unknown, unauthorized person who accessed the database of an outside vendor. This vendor sends, via email, newsletters, educational information, invitations, announcements, and other information about Mayfield to patients, business associates, event attendees, website contacts and other friends of Mayfield. Recipients of the fraudulent email who clicked on an attachment within it potentially triggered a download of a ransomware virus.  According to Thomas Rosenberger, Vice President of Communications, ""The vendor receives only email addresses from Mayfield. No other health or financial information is shared. In this incident, no Mayfield systems were involved, and no patient health or financial information was compromised.  Rosenberger added, ""Mayfield's first priority is always the well-being of our patients. Once we learned of the incident, we immediately communicated with recipients by email, by social media, and on our website, including both notification and instructions on how to remove the virus."" The communication included a free download of software to remove the malware.  Mayfield has taken several steps to ensure that an incident like this does not happen again. These include working with the vendor's compliance office to understand what transpired, locking the account so it cannot be accessed, and working with a computer virus protection service to determine if the email and/or its attachment contained a virus.  Mayfield has reviewed its policies and procedures to ensure that all patient information is secure. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation,"" Rosenberger said. ""With all of the action taken to date, we do not believe that recipients of the fraudulent email need to take any additional steps at this time.""

Gayle, who was employed as a temp, had a previous felony conviction on RICO/racketeering charges  prior to his employment at the medical center.  The South Florida Business Journal asked the medical center how he obtained employment with that criminal background. The medical center sent them a statement:  The temp agency provided a false background check on Mr. Gayle. The document did not include his prior conviction for racketeering and the date was deleted, which masked the fact that the background check was one year old. We no longer do business with this agency and have revised our background check process so this will not happen again.  According to testimony and evidence presented at trial, on February 27, 2013, the Aventura Police Department stopped a vehicle driven by Gayle after being alerted by a U.S. bank of an individual who attempted to cash a fraudulent check. Gayle presented a Jamaican passport as his form of identification. During an inventory search of the vehicle driven by Gayle, officers uncovered a black bag containing over 100 printouts from Mt. Sinai Medical Center Account Inquiry Processor with multiple names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses of patients on each printout. Additionally, photocopies of checks written to Mt. Sinai Medical Center from various individuals with a photocopy of the corresponding billing statement from Mt. Sinai were found in the bag.  According to court documents and trial testimony, during a consensual search of Gayles residence, law enforcement found multiple printouts from Mt. Sinai Medical Center that appeared similar to the ones found in his black bag. Law enforcement also found copies of U.S. Treasury checks; a document labeled HIT LIST with a list of names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth; several tax returns in the names of other individuals; multiple Tax Act and Turbo Tax pre-paid debit cards issued in the names of other individuals; a Jamaican passport in Gayles name containing a counterfeit U.S. visa; and, an identification badge for Mt.

Parker, MD, associate professor of neurosurgery as well as the former practice of neurosurgeon Patrick J. Kelly, MD. The data on the computer was duplicated by the medical center prior to the theft, so no clinical information was permanently lost.

Norfolk General Hospital, located in Simcoe, Ont., confirms its website was hacked by cybercriminals, but denies that visitors were ever at risk.  The attack appears to be part of a trend of cybercriminals targeting hospitals, including one on the Ottawa Hospital in March and another in February that hit the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, which paid a $17,000 ransom to have its systems restored.  Jrme Segura, a senior security researcher with Malwarebytes, reported in a blog post this week that in late February, Norfolk General Hospital's website was observed pushing ransomware called Teslacrypt to computers that visited the website.  Teslacrypt locks your files and makes them inaccessible using encryption, then demands a ransom of $500 US to restore access.  Drive-by download  The file was served in a ""drive-by download"" attack, Segura said, meaning you don't have to click on anything on the page.  ""You just go to the site that's compromised, and within a few seconds, malware is downloaded onto your computer and that's it,"" he told CBC News.  In this case, visitors to the site would have included patients, their families and staff who accessed a staff portal with schedules and an internal directory via the website.  Visiting Windows computers would have been vulnerable if they were running Internet Explorer or older versions of the Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight players.  Segura said hospitals are in many ways the ""perfect victim"" for cyberattacks. ""Their systems are out of date, they have a lot of confidential information and patient files. If those get locked up, they can't just ignore it.""  Segura said Malwarebytes detected an attack from the Norfolk General Hospital website via a user of Malwarebytes anti-exploit software. The free software detects and blocks web-based attacks, then sends a report back to Malwarebytes.  The attack caught Segura's eye because he's based in Canada and the attack came from a site with a .ca domain name.",http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/norfolk-general-hospital-hack-1.3504229

However, the hospital is notifying patients affected by the theft.  The hospital takes a data snapshot of every PC before junking it. It was able to look back and see what was on the hard drives.  And we saw that there was a small handful of archive of documents that had been archived on the PCs local drive containing fairly limited information relating to 1,213 patients, said John Friberg, senior vice president of Elliot Hospital.  The computers had auto-archived three spreadsheets and 20 emails. The documents included very basic information about patients, such as their names, dates of service and various billing codes.  its very important to keep in mind or to understand that this is not a situation involving the breach of electronic medical records, Friberg said. In fact, none of the information involved any medical records. For instance, nothing on these four PCs related to any medical history of any patients.  The hospital has since made changes to ensure its computers no longer auto-archive this information. Officials believe the information is unlikely to be of any value to possible identity thieves. However, they understand patients will be upset.

That's what happened to a stack of records from Tulsa's Saint Francis Hospital. The records showed up in Ponca City, and it might have gone unnoticed, except for where they were found - on the loading dock of the local newspaper.  The story made the front page, above the fold, in the Friday edition of the Ponca City News. A 3-inch tall stack of medical records turned up there - in a stack of pallets shipped from a recycling operation near Tulsa.  A pressman for the newspaper found them.  ""They were printouts and the big stack of them was electrocardiograms,"" said Tony Smith, pressman.  The records came from Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa, and appear to come from an outpatient cardiology department. Smith says the records were from multiple patients and were all recent.  ""The records were dated February 3rd of this year,"" he said, ""And it had the patients history, whether they smoked or not, a different name on a different page, and their patient identification numbers.""  The lost records that were created at Saint Francis in Tulsa apparently went to a recycler in Sand Springs first, from there to the office of the newspaper in Ponca City.  GreenStar Recycling provides secure shredding services for medical offices - but usually the records are in locked containers from start to finish.   Saint Francis Hospital didn't make anyone available for an interview, but sent this statement:  ""Patient confidentiality is of utmost concern and an investigation is underway to determine how the documents were found outside the secure handling process.""  The newspaper turned over the records to a representative from Saint Francis Friday. The hospital says they'll notify all the affected patients about their lost confidentiality.  A representative from GreenStar said they are participating in the investigation.",http://www.newson6.com/story/21476118/tulsa-medical-records-turn-up-on-ponca-city-newspaper-loading-dock

This database is used by our employees as they provide care to our consumers. The health information in this database is designed and intended to be accessible through our internal web portal only to authorized users who have been issued required log-in IDs and passwords. On December 16, 2013, we learned that the health information in our internal database was available on the internet by a Google search using the terms Supportive Concepts for Families and consumer first and last name, without using a log-in and password. The information available included names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, dates of service, and consumer service notes entered by our employees.  We immediately investigated the incident and determined that when SCFFI employees performed a computer hardware upgrade in February 2013, some of the portals security settings were not properly set. Without the proper security settings, it was possible to access the web portal information from remote locations without using log-in and password authorization. Within one hour after discovering the breach on December 16, we changed the security settings so that only authorized users with log-in IDs and passwords could access and view our database. In our investigation, we reviewed the access history to the database through our computer logs going back to the upgrade in February 2013. We have found only a few instances of access that we cannot identify. Most access was made by SCFFI personnel just before the breach was reported to us, or by SCFFI personnel to confirm the nature of the problem before correcting the servers security settings.

(Alpha), a now-defunct Los Angeles-area ambulance transportation company, have pleaded guilty in connection with an ambulance fraud scheme.  Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Departments Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Andr Birotte, Jr. of the Central District of California; Special Agent in Charge Glenn R. Ferry of the Los Angeles Region of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG); and Assistant Director in Charge Bill L. Lewis of the FBIs Los Angeles Field Office made the announcement.  Alex Kapri, aka Alex Kapriyelov or Alexander Kapriyelov, 56; Aleksey Muratov, aka Russ Muratov, 32; and Danielle Hartsell Medina, 36, pleaded guilty on October 28, 2013, before U.S. District Court Judge Audrey B. Collins in the Central District of California to conspiracy to commit health care fraud. They face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison when they are sentenced on February 24, 2014.  Kapri and Muratov were owners and operators of Alpha, an ambulance transportation company that operated in the greater Los Angeles area and that specialized in the provision of non-emergency ambulance transportation services to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, primarily dialysis patients. Medina was employed by Alpha and ultimately supervised the training and education of its employees.  According to court documents, Kapri, Muratov, and Medina knowingly provided non-emergency ambulance transportation services to Medicare beneficiaries whose medical condition at that time did not require those services. With Kapris knowledge, Muratov and Medina instructed certain Alpha employees to conceal the Medicare beneficiaries medical conditions by altering requisite paperwork and creating fraudulent reasons that justified, on paper, the transportation services. Based on these medically unnecessary transportation services, the defendants caused Alpha to submit false and fraudulent claims to Medicare.  Additionally, as the defendants were submitting false and fraudulent claims to Medicare, Medicare notified Alpha the company would be subject to a Medicare audit. In response to this notice, Muratov and Medina instructed Alpha employeeswith Kapris knowledgeto alter requisite paperwork and create fraudulent reasons that justified, on paper, transportation services for the beneficiaries identified as the subject of Medicares audit.  From at least June 2008 through at least July 2012, Alpha submitted more than $49 million in claims for ambulance transportation services. As a result, Medicare paid Alpha more than $13 million for these claims, many of which were false and fraudulent.  The case was investigated by the FBI and HHS-OIG and was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, under the supervision of the Criminal Divisions Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Central District of California. This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Blanca Quintero and Alexander F. Porter and Assistant Chief O. Benton Curtis, III.  Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, now operating in nine cities across the country, has charged more than 1,500 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for more than $5 billion. In addition, HHSs Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.",http://www.fbi.gov/losangeles/press-releases/2013/owners-and-supervisor-of-ambulance-transportation-company-plead-guilty-in-los-angeles-for-roles-in-ambulance-fraud-scheme?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter

Keniona Laneen Thomas, a former employee at Carolina Neurosurgery & Spine Associates, was charged in a bill of information filed Monday.  She sold the information of more than 150 patients at $10 a person, according to the court document.  A Channel 9 reporter reached Thomas by phone Tuesday.  She declined to comment on the situation but apologized to the victims and said she was extremely remorseful.  Records show she has reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. However, she has not yet made any court appearances in the matter.  A CNSA executive told Channel 9 that it immediately notified all patients affected last fall. It also offered free credit-monitoring services and complied with federal HIPAA requirements, the executive said.  CEO Mary Cloninger released a written statement that reads in part:  ""When Ms. Thomas' illicit activities first came to light, Carolina Neurosurgery & Spine and Federal authorities jointly conducted a thorough investigation. That investigation resulted in both Ms. Thomas' termination from employment and in the federal charges… CNSA is grateful to the federal government for its diligence in prosecuting Ms. Thomas and helping to protect patients at CNSA and elsewhere.""   Federal authorities said Thomas sold the information to Christopher Roach. On Thursday, a federal judge sentenced Roach to more than 7½ years in prison for using stolen identities to open credit cards and purchase more than a quarter-million dollars.  A Facebook page belonging to a Keniona Thomas shows a woman seated at the front of a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools bus. CMS records list a Keniona L.

Deborah Costner Taylor pleaded guilty in court Friday to identity theft and obtaining property by false pretense. The 49-year-old woman will serve more than four months behind bars. After entering her plea, Taylor turned to one of her victims and apologized. Im sorry to everyone Ive hurt, and I pray one day that yall can forgive me, she said.   Misplaced faith Taylor gained the trust of an elderly man and woman before stealing from them. She is married to the pastor of East Belmont Baptist Church and worked at CaroMont Regional Medical Center in Gastonia at the time of the incidents. Those connections gave her access to the people she victimized, members of her church. Taylor offered to help two elderly members of the congregation who were having medical issues. She helped treat them, looked in on them, changed bandages and then began to access their personal information to her benefit, Gaston County Assistant District Attorney Beth Stockwell said. Criminal charges More than a dozen arrest warrants were issued for Taylor in February 2014. Between 2013 and 2014, Taylor used the mans credit card to make purchases. She also wrote checks to herself from the womans bank account and used the womans identity to open a credit card. Checks totaled nearly $600, and charges totaled about $1,300 from several Gastonia stores. Prior to the identity theft charges, Taylor had already found herself in trouble with the law. Stolen drugs Taylor pleaded guilty in July to stealing painkillers from CaroMont on her days off. Taylor worked for the hospital in 2013 and used her passcodes to take Dilaudid, morphine and oxycodone. She would then note that the medications had been dispensed to patients. The hospitals security system picked up on the discrepancies, and Taylor was arrested in March 2013. She was sentenced to two years of probation. Drug addiction Drug addiction is at the root of Taylors crimes, according to her attorney, David Phillips. Taylor had a back injury years ago. A prescription for Percocet turned into an addiction, Phillips said. Since her July conviction, Taylor spent 134 days in drug rehabilitation, according to her attorney. Jail time Taylor, 49, will spend 135 days behind bars, a sentence that begins Monday. Superior Court Judge Eric Levinson allowed Taylor to wait until Monday to report to jail so she can attend a family members funeral. Once Taylor is released, she will spend five years on probation and complete more than 100 hours of community service.",http://www.gastongazette.com/20150306/nurse-pastors-wife-pleads-guilty-to-id-theft/303069932

Central immediately consulted with forensic IT experts to identify and remove the malware and determine exactly what information on the server may have been accessed. The malware was removed and the server has been disconnected from Centrals system.  The information on the server that may or may not have been accessed included patients name, address, phone numbers, date of birth, social security number, billing and diagnostic codes, insurance company, insurance co-payment information, healthcare provider, employer information, sex, treatment date, account balance, email address, and race.  Based on Centrals forensic investigation to date it is believed that patient bank account and payment card information were not compromised and electronic medical records were not on this server as they were encrypted by Central prior to the malware being placed on the server.  Taking aggressive action early and confronting this issue is consistent with the practices core value of behaving in an ethical and transparent fashion, said Greg Catt, Practice Administrator at Central Dermatology Center & Carolina Medi-Spa. Central hired a prominent forensics security expert firm and an information technology firm that investigated this incident, reviewed all systems, and Central has improved our security wherever necessary to help protect our community. On behalf of the people of Central Dermatology Center, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

On Sept. 26, went to an endocrinologist at Cotton-ONeil Diabetes and Endocrinology Center, which is part of the Stormont-Vail HealthCare system, for a routine checkup to monitor her diabetes. During the checkup, she asked if the physician could give her a new glucometer, and within a short time a nurse  a different nurse than who had checked her in  brought her a sample glucometer in a box, as well as a box of test strips.  When Stein, 56, returned home, she noticed a folded 8-by-11-inch, two-page patient data report between the boxes of medical supplies. She unfolded the document and started reading about mid-page to see if the medication list was correct.  Under diagnosis, she saw severe obesity, which didnt apply to her. She read further and noticed the medications and diagnoses listed werent hers either.  Knowing something was wrong, her eyes scanned to the top of the page. There, she saw another patients name, address, birth date, current and past diagnoses, medications, medical record number, allergies, and vitals, such as height and weight.  Thats when all the HIPAA stuff went through my mind, she said, referring to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a federal law that restricts access to and use of health information.  Because of her training as a psychotherapist, Stein knew the ramifications of a breach of privacy under HIPAA. An unscrupulous person could use the information to steal ones identity or use it in a way that could cost an individual his job, future earnings, health insurance and child custody status.  Now Im thinking in my mind, Who got my paper?  she said.  The next day, Stein called the physicians office to let them know of the privacy breach and was told an investigation would be launched. It was suggested she talk to Barbara Duncan, the chief privacy officer at Stormont-Vail HealthCare.  A few days later, Stein said, she and Duncan met at Stormont-Vail. When Duncan asked for the patient data report back, Stein refused because she was afraid if she returned the document there would be no way to prove a breach of privacy had occurred.  I asked her if she realized the damage that could be done (if someone misused the information), Stein said. Its a violation of federal law to not protect your privacy. I think the issue is carelessness and laziness. People get complacent about compliance.  Stein isnt the only one who mistakenly has received private medical data. The Topeka Capital-Journal frequently receives unsolicited documents containing private medical information from local hospitals and physicians offices. The Capital-Journal discards the documents or mails them back, as requested by the corresponding health care facility.  Complying with the law  Nancy Burkhardt, spokeswoman for Stormont-Vail HealthCare, said the medical facility values the confidentiality of our patients health information and therefore cannot discuss details related to a specific patient or matters connected to pending or potential litigation.  Burkhardt said Stormont-Vail is vigilant when it comes to protecting patient privacy.  From the moment employees are hired and annually thereafter, education and guidance is provided as to the appropriate handling of patient information, she said. The importance of protecting patient privacy is communicated through articles published in our employee newsletters and in regular corporate compliance meetings. To ensure appropriate monitoring, prevention and detection, we have a HIPAA privacy officer, who is responsible for HIPAA privacy compliance.  If a breach of patient privacy is suspected, Stormont-Vails HIPAA privacy officer conducts a thorough investigation that is consistent with federal law, regulations and standards, Burkhardt said. The privacy officer contacts any patients involved and works to prevent or minimize any harm to the patients.  Depending on the circumstances, the investigation could result in staff education, process improvement and/or appropriate corrective action, which could include termination, she said.  Donna Moranville, with the privacy/security compliance division of the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System in Denver, said St. Francis Health in Topeka goes to great lengths to ensure a patients privacy.  St. Francis employees are expected to familiarize themselves with written policies regarding patient privacy and security. All St. Francis personnel are trained upon their hiring and again annually. Patients are provided a Notice of Privacy Practices, which spells out the medical facilitys practices regarding the protection of their information.  Moranville said HIPAA requires hospitals, physician practices, and other covered entities to notify the patient and the responsible federal agency when records are misdirected, unless an assessment indicates the risk to the patient is low.  She said St. Francis prefers misdirected documents be returned to the facility so the risk to the patient can be better assessed.  In instances where a Social Security number or other specific types of financial information is involved, in addition to notifying the patient, we offer credit monitoring services to the patient(s) involved, she said.  In addition, Moranville said, employees are trained to report immediately any suspected breach of privacy. After an investigation and as part of its mitigation, St. Francis may require additional training for the personnel involved in a breach or a change in its internal processes.  Relative to disciplinary action, SCLHS recently implemented a consistent sanctions policy for applying appropriate sanctions for violations of HIPAA that takes into account criteria, such as whether the breach was intentional, resulted in an inappropriate use or disclosure, or caused risk of harm to the patient, she said.  Under new regulations that went into effect this year, Moranville said, civil penalties can be imposed for HIPAA violations ranging from $100 per penalty up to a maximum annual penalty of $1.5 million per violation type.  Future action  Stein said she wrote a letter to Stormont-Vail HealthCare on Oct. 3 that discussed consequences if her records were improperly given to another individual. Anne M. Kindling, manager of risk management for Stormont-Vail, responded to Stein in a letter dated Oct. 15.  Kindling indicated Stormont-Vail had investigated the incident and found Steins medical report had been printed once and the documents had been placed in a secure box intended for shredding.  When your concern came to light, we were able to retrieve the documents from the shred box and have secured them in our Risk Management Department, Kindling wrote. Since we were able to retrieve all of the documents, I am confident that your records were not disclosed to any other individual and therefore there was no breach as to your own health information.  Since there was no breach and your damages are speculative only, your claim for damages is denied.  Kindling also said in the letter that she would be sending Stein an affidavit to sign, confirming Stein hadnt and wouldnt disclose the patient data records she had mistakenly received.  I still encourage you to return them to Stormont-Vail where we can secure them, which has been previously requested on more than one occasion and which you have refused to do, she wrote. Since you will not return them, at a minimum I request that you secure the documents in a locked container and that neither you nor anyone else access or view the records, and that you not disclose the information you may have learned by reading the documents even after you were aware they were not intended for you.  Stein, who said she never received an affidavit from Stormont-Vail, has contacted an attorney and is considering legal action.",http://m.cjonline.com/news/local/2013-11-16/patient-mistakenly-receives-anothers-medical-records

The incident was just added to HHSs breach list today.  I was unable to find any media coverage of the breach, but found a notice on the centers web site that was still prominently linked from their home page. Its one that you will want to read in its entirety.  Potential Disclosure of Personal Health Information  Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Health Center On August 27, 2013, we learned that Professional Transcription Company (PTC), a company that was hired by us to transcribe dictated physician reports, had hired a subcontractor, Bahoo.net (Bahoo), which allowed certain transcriptions to be publicly available through Bahoos website and through certain search engines (e.g., Google). Upon investigation, it was determined that Bahoo failed to adequately secure its File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site allowing certain transcriptions to be viewable. The information in the transcriptions included patient names, type of treatment/procedure, diagnoses and dates of service, but did not include social security numbers, financial information, contact information or any other personal information in the patients medical records. As soon as the incident was identified, Bahoo closed its website and destroyed the hard drive so that the public could no longer view such personal information on the website. The unintended consequence of Bahoos decision to destroy the hard drive is that it is not possible to identify the specific dates the personal information was posted or whose information was publicly viewable. To be cautious, we notified by mail all patients whose information was sent to PTC over the past four years.In addition to taking these steps, Bahoo worked with the internet provider to prevent the transcriptions from being viewable in the internet search. We also hired a technical consultant to work with the other search engines to ensure the removal of any transcriptions that might still be viewable. Although no financial information was included, patients were advised that if they become aware of any suspicious activity in their accounts, they should report it to immediately to us.  If you have any questions or wish to make a report, please call us at the Call Center, 877-451-9361 (toll free), Monday through Friday, 9 am to 6 pm.  The security of patient information is critically important to us, as it is to our patients. We will continue to take all steps necessary to meet this goal and in furtherance of our mission of needed health care to the communities we serve.  The reference to Professional Transcription Service sounded familiar to me, and I did some digging and found out that the PTS breach had been reported on this site back in December 2010, after another one of their clients, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, had reported the incident to HHS. The New Jersey hospitals report did not mention Bahoo.net, so this is the first time were learning that it was their error. Interestingly, MLK did not seem to have named Professional Transcription Services or Bahoo.net in their computerized breach report to HHS, which means their names dont show up on HHSs breach list for this incident. To the extent that some people consider HHSs public breach tool a Wall of Shame (I dont view it that way), those responsible for the breach should have been names.  But why did other PTS clients find out about the breach in December 2010 but Martin luther King Jr. Health Center only find out in August 2013? Was it because Bahoo destroyed the hard drive before it was thoroughly analyzed?  If so, what an unfortunate over-reaction on their part.  Kudos to Martin Luther King Jr. Health Center for genuinely erring on the side of  caution to notify everyone in 4-year window. And Im impressed that they even explained the FTP error on Bahoos part.  Finally, did anyone else note that MLK told patients to call them if they wish to make a report of suspicious activity on their account? When entities tell patients to call law enforcement, they put themselves in a position of not knowing if problems have occurred related to their breach, which also limits their ability to actually support the patient or help mitigate any harm.  By telling patients to call them, MLK demonstrated to its patients that it was there for them and cared enough to want to know if they experienced any difficulty as a result of the breach. I think it was a smart move on their part.

In mid-November, an employee of Carewise Health, a subcontractor of HP ES, responded to a telephone computer scam, resulting in unauthorized remote access to a computer that contained a database with information on the Medicaid clients. HP ES and Carewise Health disabled the laptop as soon as the breach was reported, and notified CHFS. Typically such scams are targeted at charging people for unnecessary computer services. While there is no evidence that the confidential contents of the database were accessed, the hacker did have access to the employee’s laptop for a brief period. The database included health and other information about the individuals being notified, including social security numbers for less than half the individuals.

""We have appropriately disciplined the employee, including reinforcing education regarding our policies and procedures in maintaining the confidentiality of patient information,"" the letter states.

Parkview will pay $800,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to address deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  Parkview is a nonprofit health care system that provides community-based health care services to individuals in northeast Indiana and northwest Ohio. OCR opened an investigation after receiving a complaint from a retiring physician alleging that Parkview had violated the HIPAA Privacy Rule.  In September 2008, Parkview took custody of medical records pertaining to approximately 5,000 to 8,000 patients while assisting the retiring physician to transition her patients to new providers, and while considering the possibility of purchasing some of the physicians practice.  On June 4, 2009, Parkview employees, with notice that the physician was not at home, left 71 cardboard boxes of these medical records unattended and accessible to unauthorized persons on the driveway of the physicians home, within 20 feet of the public road and a short distance away from a heavily trafficked public shopping venue. As a covered entity under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Parkview must appropriately and reasonably safeguard all protected health information in its possession, from the time it is acquired through its disposition. All too often we receive complaints of records being discarded or transferred in a manner that puts patient information at risk, said Christina Heide, acting deputy director of health information privacy at OCR.  It is imperative that HIPAA covered entities and their business associates protect patient information during its transfer and disposal. Parkview cooperated with OCR throughout its investigation. In addition to the $800,000 resolution amount, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring Parkview to revise their policies and procedures, train staff, and provide an implementation report to OCR.

Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center reported the violations of health care privacy laws to the state and has warned employees to keep away from Suleman's records unless they have a medical purpose, hospital spokesman Jim Anderson said Monday.  ""Despite the notoriety of this case, to us this person is a patient who deserves the privacy that all our patients get,"" Anderson said.  Anderson would not elaborate on how the other eight employees were reprimanded, saying only that the punishments were significant.  A similar privacy breach at UCLA hospitals led to celebrities' medical information getting leaked to tabloids in recent years, including details of Farrah Fawcett's cancer treatment showing up in the National Enquirer. An investigation there resulted in firings, suspensions and warnings for 165 hospital employees, ranging from doctors to orderlies.  Anderson said Kaiser does not believe any of Suleman's information was shared with the media, based on the results of their inquiry.  The 33-year-old single mother of 14 gave birth to her octuplets on Jan. 26 at Kaiser's hospital in Bellflower, about 17 miles (27 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.  Her attorney Jeff Czech said Suleman does not plan to file a lawsuit over the breach, though he suspects Kaiser employees were looking for medical information on Suleman's sperm donor. He said the name is not listed on the medical records.  ""She trusts Kaiser and they said they'd look into it,"" Czech said. ""We feel that they're on top of it and are taking care of it.""  Anderson could not provide details about when Suleman's medical records were accessed and what kind of hospital employees looked at them. He said Kaiser had warned its employees about patient confidentiality rules before Suleman checked into the hospital in December.  ""Even though no one knew she was there, they knew she was going to have a lot of babies,"" Anderson said. ""The extra monitoring helped determine that there were people who looked at the records who did not have reason to do so.""  Even if the employees peeked at the records just to satisfy their curiosity, without any intention of disclosing details, they were disciplined according to Kaiser's policies, Anderson said.

Tampa General said Friday that it's unclear what happened to these cover sheets, which typically include patient names, addresses, birth dates, insurers, diagnoses and, in some cases, Social Security numbers.

Apparently, the dentist hired a third party vendor to dispose of the records; that vendor likely was a business associate under HIPAA and, if so, also subject to the HIPAA privacy and security rules.  For small medical or dental practices, as for other professional service businesses such as lawyers, accountants, and insurance brokers, data security can be both daunting and expensive if there is a breach. Like many businesses, small businesses rely on third party vendors to perform certain activities. When those activities involve personal information of the business customers, the business owner should be paying more attention. Ask the vendor about what steps it has in place to protect information, does it have a written information security plan, it is licensed, does it have insurance in the event of a breach, does it train employees about data security, and, yes, how does it dispose the records and data it is being asked to handle. In many states, businesses are required to have language in the service agreements with vendors about data security when the vendors are going to handle personal information. There is a similar provision under HIPAA for business associates.  It is troubling to see that sensitive records are still being found in dumpsters even after the many widely-publicized data breaches. But, as here, the owner of the records may not be able to avoid responsibility by shifting it to the vendor.

The Oregon-based company, which primarily provides dental services for low-income patients and operates more than 30 clinics throughout the state, discovered that hackers had gained access to its internal computer systems and patient database over a period of three days between Feb 23 and Feb 26, 2015.  In accordance with HIPAA Security Rule Technical Safeguards, Advantage Dental had implemented a system which monitored access to the PHI of its patients, and that intrusion detection system identified individuals had accessed the Protected Health Information of its patients. Access to the data was quickly shut down but the company determined that during that time, names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and Social Security numbers were accessed. No financial information, payment details or healthcare data was exposed in the incident as this information was stored in a separate database.  While HIPAA covers Protected Health information, which primarily concerns medical and dental records, personally identifiable information is also included under HIPAA and is classed as PHI if it can be linked to an individual. Since Social Security numbers were exposed along with names and contact information, this is a HIPAA breach and is reportable to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights.  The company is bound by HIPAA Breach Notification Rules and must issue notification letters to all individuals affected by the breach to alert them to the fact that their personal information has potentially been compromised to enable them to take action to mitigate any risk. Advantage Dental is assisting its patients in this regard, again a requirement of HIPAA, by offering Experian credit monitoring services to those affected. The company has also agreed to cover the cost of the credit agency's premium product, ProtectMyID Elite, for a period of two years.  Following an internal investigation, Advantage was able to determine that the records of 151,626 customers had been affected by the malware-related incident, according to a Bend Bulletin report. At this stage of the investigation the company does not believe that any of the information obtained by the thieves has been used to commit medical or identity fraud. The incident has been reported to the Oregon Attorney General's office, the Oregon State Police and the U.S. Secret Service, although it is not clear whether the OCR has yet been notified. The company has 60-days in order to make the breach report.  Advantage Dental's HIPAA Compliance Manager, Jeff Dover, was quick to highlight the effectiveness of its intrusion detection system in limiting the damage caused. In many cases, as with the recent mega-data breaches at Premera Blue Cross and Anthem, hackers who are able to infiltrate healthcare computer systems are given weeks, months and sometimes years to access, copy and use PHI without detection. Dover advised the press that its hacking incident was identified and resolved ""comparatively quickly"".  Access was gained via malware which had managed to escape detection by the company's anti-virus software. The malware obtained the login credentials of a member of staff which was subsequently used to access its membership database. The healthcare provider has approximately 250,000 customers throughout the state, although its total database contains the records of close to 1.5 million individuals, although it appears that only a small proportion of these individuals have been affected.  Advantage took prompt action to shut down access and the healthcare provider has already taken steps to prevent future breaches from occurring. It is now restricting external access to its database and is now only permitting access via its internal network.  This is the second breach to hit an Oregon healthcare provider in just a few days. Bend Bulletin reports that Mosaic Medical, a central Oregon clinic, was also successfully hacked this month. That incident resulted in the data of 2,200 patients being exposed, which included personal identifiers as well as insurance information.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/advantage-dental-hipaa-breach-exposes-more-than-150k-patient-records-623/; http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/253880-123802-advantage-dental-says-patient-records-were-breached

And the ease with which the thieves were able to walk off with the sensitive files points up how vulnerable British Columbians' private medical histories have become with the increasing digitization of records.  The NDP is calling for mandatory reporting for privacy breaches, recommended last year by B.C.'s privacy commissioner.  Opposition health critic Judy Darcy said B.C. is one of only three provinces that don't require mandatory reporting, and she accused the government of dragging its feet.  ""We're already seeing these kinds of privacy breaches and we have a lot of work to do"" before all records are electronic, she said.  B.C. Health communications manager Laura Heinze said in an email the government has accepted the commissioner's recommendation and ""intends to bring forward legislation at the next available opportunity,"" but she wouldn't be more specific.  Heinze said the privacy commission is working with doctors to update procedures under the Personal Information Protection Act.  The theft of the 4,000 medical histories, which included names, addresses and B.C. Care Card numbers, occurred before midnight on Feb. 3 after the ransacking of the 11th-floor offices of the Vancouver Division of Family Practice (DoFP), a non-profit group funded by the Doctors of B.C.

We take patient privacy very seriously, and its currently under investigation to fully evaluate the situation, Samaritan spokeswoman Janelle Iverson said Friday.  Janet Wood, who travels to Corvallis from Newport for medical care, opened the trash can to throw away tissue when she made the discovery.  I didnt have my glasses on, but I grabbed a stack of papers off the top and sifted through and saw a couple things in bold print  one said pregnancy results, one said diagnosis, she said. I was so shook up, thinking about if something like that happened to me ... there were written prescriptions in there, signed in ink, for narcotics  lots of them.  The documents, according to Capt. Dave Henslee of the Corvallis Police Department, bore the address of Samaritan Family Medicine Resident Clinic. The responding officer witnessed the clinics employees recover several hundred documents from the receptacle, Henslee said. Because Wood told the officer the paperwork was confidential in nature, he didnt look at them and police did nothing further because no crime had been committed, he said.  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 sets privacy standards for patients medical information. If a breach of privacy did occur, the clinic could be subject to civil lawsuit or an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights, which has the authority to impose penalties.  The paperwork would have had to have contained individually identifiable health information  like medical documents with patients names  to have been considered a breach, and Wood didnt look closely enough to see if that kind of information was present.  Wood said there was more than just one stack of papers in the garbage.  They started taking documents out in their hands, she said. Then they realized that the garbage can was all the way full of them, so they took the entire garbage can.  Someone from Samaritan Health Services contacted Wood after the incident.  She called me about an hour later and said that they were investigating it but they believed that it was the cleaning person that mistakenly took it out to the garbage, Wood recalled.  Iverson would not provide details about the case or of Samaritans protocols in disposing of confidential medical documents.  Our staff is regularly trained on our practices to protect patient information, she said. There are multiple protocols in place for confidential information, and thats really all I can say because its currently under investigation.  Wood believes that the case is being taken seriously.  I dont go to that particular clinic, but the Samaritan doctors I do go to are truly amazing, and I totally trust in their service and professionalism, she said. I believe theyll get to the bottom of this; I really do. Hopefully that was the only time that it happened.

The 12 plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in Queens Supreme Court against the Nassau County hospital and its parent company, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. They claimed since the fall of 2010, medical record face sheets with full names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, medical histories and other information were stolen from the hospital. If the public cannot trust North Shore University Hospital and its hospital network to safeguard and security their private identity and health, confidential, sensitive information, how can they trust them with their lives? said plaintiffs attorney Bonita E. Zelman.  Many plaintiffs have already suffered identity theft as a result, the lawsuit said. One victim received a letter saying a fraudulent tax return was filed with her Social Security number on it, the suit said. Others saw hundreds or even thousands of dollars charged to fraudulent credit cards and cell phone accounts opened up in their names. Last year, two suspects  Clincy M. Robinson and Dennis Messias  were arrested and charged separately with identity theft in connection with the hospital face sheet thefts, the lawsuit said. Robinson, who later pleaded guilty, was found in possession of 25 North Shore University Hospital face sheets, the suit said. The suit claimed the hospital was aware for more than a year of a theft ring in operation, but failed to notify patients promptly. The lawsuit accused the hospital of negligence, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and violation of several laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that guarantees privacy for individual medical information. The lawsuit sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, as well as the creation of a fund for comprehensive credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Denise Abdale, the plaintiff who saw a false tax return filed in her name, said the hospital is responsible, along with the two identity thieves. I want them to own up and take responsibility for their actions, she said. Plaintiff Katherine Cross told 1010 WINS Sonia Rincon the thefts could happen again. It is the uncertainty that is the most devastating, she said. In a statement, North Shore-LIJ Health System spokesman Terry Lynam said procedures have been put in place to better protect patient information. The hospital has taken aggressive steps to strengthen the security protocols we have in place to protect patient information, Lynam said in the statement. In the past 11 months, no further identify thefts have been reported to the hospital, indicating that the safeguards the hospital now has in place are working. But plaintiff attorney Zelman did not agree. Patients that go to North Shore University Hospital or Long Island Jewish Hospital are still at risk, she said.

Kardashian was among the patient whose records were accessed inappropriately at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles between June 18 and June 24. The Los Angeles Times reported that six workers were fired for the internal breach, but hopefully this case will help alert the public of ongoing health data security issues and spark conversation within the industry to reevaluate celebrity patient privacy procedures.  Kardashian gave birth on June 15 at Cedars-Sinai to North West (yes, thats her real name) and according to Reuters, the organization contacted her shortly after checking out of the hospital to alert her that her data had been breached. Exactly what patient information, such as medical or financial data, was viewed has yet to be reported.  Los Angeles healthcare organizations such as Cedars-Sinai often have to deal with high-profile patient records being targeted during internal breaches and this Cedars-Sinai case was no different, as five of the employees accessed a single patient record the other viewed 14 different records.  Cedars-Sinai said that three community physicians, Dr. Sam Bakshian, Dr. Abraham Ishaaya and Dr. Shamim Shakibai, violated hospital policy by offering their user names and passwords to employees, who then used the logins to access confidential patient records, including Kardashians. And according to a Cedars-Sinai statement, four of the six workers who logged onto the hospitals information system without permission to access patient records were local physicians employees that had hospital staff privileges. The others were a research assistant and volunteer.  David Blake, Cedars-Sinais chief privacy officer, said in a statement to the Times that the hospital has a high standard for security and that unauthorized access to any patients record is, quite simply, unacceptable.  Though theres a strong chance that employees werent trying to do much beyond look at the records in efforts to find Kardashians. But Cedars-Sinai was smart to act swiftly in firing all of the employees involved and banning them from accessing its patient data from another organization in the future. Healthcare organizations can only do so much to train employees and when they give out passwords to their underlings who arent supposed to have access, it makes their job to protect data even harder.  Other high-profile patient privacy breaches at Los Angeles healthcare organizations include data belonging to late actress Farrah Fawcett, Britney Spears and Maria Shriver being inappropriately accessed at UCLA Medical Center.",http://healthitsecurity.com/2013/07/15/kim-kardashians-patient-data-breached-at-cedars-sinai/

Reynaldo Estrada pleaded guilty today to one count each of conspiracy to commit identity theft, aggravated identity theft, and aiding and abetting the use of a false Social Security number. The U.S. Attorneys Office said between October 2010 and October 2011, Estrada, while he was working for Crozer-Chester Medical Centers environmental services department and at Community Hospital in Chester, Pa., stole ""scores"" of treatment authorization forms containing the names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers of patients. Estrada admitted today that he gave the forms to co-conspirators who paid him for the stolen identities, knowing that the forms would be used as a part of a tax fraud scheme. The co-conspirators, Rafael Henriquez Polanco and Yanira Lopez, are charged in a separate indictment with allegedly using the identifying information provided by Estrada to prepare and file approximately 144 false and fraudulent federal individual income tax returns claiming bogus refunds in excess of $1.7 million. Both Polanco and Lopez have pleaded guilty to all charges against them, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. The case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Security Service, the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations.

A man, M, who was involved in legal proceedings with his former partner, X, was a patient of a medical centre. The medical centre previously provided medical care to M and his family when he and X were still together.   X visited the medical centre with her new partner, N, and they requested historical information about the family and, in particular, an incident which involved one of the children a number of years before.   The medical centre assumed that N was M and so released all of the health information held about M, X and the children to the couple. This included a separate file relating to M which contained highly sensitive information about an anxiety disorder he was suffering from.   X then attached the information obtained from the medical centre to an affidavit presented to the Family Court in an attempt to show M as a bad parent. M was humiliated by the disclosure.  Rule 5 of the Health Information Privacy Code requires health agencies, such as the medical centre, to ensure that health information is protected, by reasonable security safeguards, against unauthorised disclosure.   In addition, section 45(a) of the Privacy Act requires agencies ensure that a requester is appropriately identified before providing them with personal or health information.   Rule 11 expects that a health agency shall not disclose health information to any individual unless the agency believes on reasonable grounds that an exception applies.   Here, the medical centre made an assumption that N was M and took no steps to ensure that this assumption was correct. Instead, it disclosed highly sensitive information about M to X and N.   We were satisfied that the medical centre breached rule 5 as it lacked the procedures and processes to ensure that steps were always taken to establish identity before releasing health information.   We were also satisfied that the disclosure of this information breached rule 11 as no exception applied to allow the medical centre to disclose the information.   We formed the view that the disclosure of M's information to X and N caused M significant harm and we conveyed this view to the medical centre.   The medical centre accepted that its procedures were lacking, made extensive changes to its policy regarding the identification of information requesters, and trained its staff in their obligations under the Code.   The medical centre also agreed to apologise directly to M for its actions, pay him financial compensation and provide him and his children with free medical services for a set period of time.

Diatherix Laboratories last month notified 7,016 people across the U.S. that their protected health information had been compromised and viewed by unauthorized, outside parties after its billing contractor Diamond Computing Company had one of its server's data accessible through Google.  The server, officials noted, contained patient billing documents, health insurance forms, patient names and addressees. Many of the documents also included patient Social Security numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses codes and diagnostics tests ordered.  After using an outside security firm to investigate the incident, Diatherix discovered the server was unsecured since Sept. 24, 2011. Diatherix further confirmed that files containing patient protected health information had been viewed from the outside in March 2014. Despite the server being unsecured and accessible on the Internet for nearly three years, Diatherix did not realize the security breach until July 2014.  ""Our organization takes information security and patient privacy very seriously,"" read an August notification letter to patients. ""We deeply regret this situation and any inconvenience this may cause our patients.""  Diatherix officials said they have reached out to Google and other search engines known to have indexed the files containing PHI and requested the data be removed.  To date, nearly 39 million people have had their protected health information compromised in HIPAA privacy or security breaches involving 500 people or more, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.  The Office for Civil Rights, the HHS division responsible for investigating HIPAA violations, in recent months has demonstrated that these kind of breaches due to ""willful neglect"" will not be tolerated, as just this May, OCR slapped New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center with its biggest HIPAA settlement yet -- $4.8 million -- for failing to protect patient data after it wound up on Google.  It was discovered that the HIPAA breach transpired when a Columbia University physician, who developed applications for New York-Presbyterian and the university, attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing ePHI. Due to lack of technical safeguards, server deactivation resulted in ePHI being accessible on the Internet.  The data was so widely accessible online that the entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who saw the ePHI of their deceased partner, a former NYP patient, online.  ""Our cases against NYP and CU should remind healthcare organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems,"" said Christina Heide, acting deputy director of health information privacy for OCR, in a press statement announcing the settlement.",http://www.govhealthit.com/news/when-patient-health-data-lands-google; http://www.oag.state.md.us/idtheft/Breach%20Notices/itu-243549.pdf

Someone had broken into his car and stolen his briefcase and company laptop along with it.  So began a nightmare that cost his small nonprofit health consultancy nearly $300,000 in legal, private investigation, credit monitoring and media consultancy fees.  Tripathis nonprofit, the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative in Waltham, Mass., works with doctors and hospitals to help digitize their patient records. His employees stolen laptop contained unencrypted records for 13,687 patients  each record containing some combination of a patients name, Social Security number, birth date, contact information and insurance information  an identity theft gold mine.  His experience, which proved costly, was hardly uncommon. Large-scale medical data breaches have been on the rise in recent years.  As part of the 2009 stimulus bill, the federal government provides incentive payments to doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records.  Nearly 40 percent of U.S. primary-care doctors and about 25 percent of hospitals now use electronic patient records.  An unintended consequence is that as patient records have been digitized, health data breaches have surged as hospitals adopt electronic medical records and mobile technology without spending enough on security to ensure patient privacy.  The number of reported breaches was up 32 percent in 2011 from the year before, according to the Ponemon Institute, a Michigan-based information-security research group.  Those breaches cost the industry an estimated $6.5 billion in 2010. In 49 percent of the cases, lost or stolen phones or personal computers were responsible.  Fifty-three percent of the organizations surveyed by the group said that inadequate funding was the biggest barrier to preventing data breaches.  Fallout can be severe  When mistakes occur, the fallout can be more severe than the typical breach of email addresses or credit card numbers.  In the wrong hands, health records also can be used for blackmail and public humiliation. The information can also be used by insurance companies to inflate rates, or by employers to deny job applicants.  Tripathi, of Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative, didnt find the stolen laptop, and the incident cost his nonprofit $288,000  not to mention 600 hours dealing with the fallout and the intangible cost of repairing the reputational damage that followed.  In many ways, it got off easy. In October, a desktop computer containing unencrypted records on more than 4 million patients was stolen from Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system based in Sacramento. A rock was thrown through a window to gain access to the computer. The theft is now the subject of two class-action suits, each of which seeks $1,000 for each patient record breached.  The stolen computer did not contain patient financial records, Social Security numbers, health plan identification numbers or actual medical records, Sutter said.  Many major breaches  Since federal health care data-breach notification rules took effect in 2009, Health and Human Services records show that the Sutter theft was exceeded only when the U.S. militarys health insurance program lost backup tapes in September containing information on more than 4.9 million patients.  Last year, hard drives containing health histories, financial information and Social Security numbers of 1.9 million Health Net insurance customers disappeared from an office. State regulators launched investigations into Health Nets security procedures.  In one of the largest cases before implementation of notification rules, government health data was at risk in 2006 when a laptop with data on 26.5 million veterans was stolen from a government employees home. The computer equipment was recovered, and the FBI said the sensitive files werent accessed.  In another California case, Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto blamed a subcontractor used by an outside vendor for a privacy breach that led to the posting online of medical information for thousands of emergency room patients.  The data of 20,000 patients, including names and diagnosis codes, remained on a commercial website for nearly a year until it was discovered in August and taken down.  The spreadsheet included names, diagnosis codes, account numbers, admission and discharge dates, and billing charges for patients seen at Stanford Hospitals emergency room during a six-month period in 2009, said Gary Migdol, a spokesman for Stanford Hospital and Clinics. It did not include Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit card numbers or other information used to perpetrate identity theft, he said, but the hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients.  Lagging in encryption  Roughly one-fifth of the publicly disclosed breaches in the last seven years have involved health care providers, according to a database kept by San Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.  The increasing digitization of medical data are creating new problems, as the information travels more easily among the dozens of contractors that are typically authorized to handle a persons medical records and is more easily lost or accidentally posted online.  While Sutter said the computer was password-protected, the data on patients was not encrypted, drawing criticism from privacy and computer security experts.  On a computer in which data are encrypted, a user would typically have to enter another password in addition to the computers general password to access that specific data.  Though encrypting patient information is highly recommended by the federal government, Verizon health care and data security expert Dr. Peter Tippett said the health care industry lags behind the financial and high-tech industries by 10 to 15 years when it comes to protecting personal data.  Overall, the health care system needs a lot of work at being more secure, Tippett said.  In most cases, Tippett said, computer thieves are simply looking to make a little cash reselling the stolen computer itself. Sometimes they may try to ransom the computer back to its original owner. If the data itself is accessed, usually by organized crime operations, he said criminals would generally try to use it to blackmail prominent people with potentially embarrassing diagnoses or steal patients identities to fraudulently bill health insurers for medical procedures that werent really performed.  Cleanup complicated  Cleaning up after such breaches can be difficult.  Tripathi, of eHealth Collaborative, went to work assembling a crisis team of lawyers and customers and a chief security officer. The biggest headache, he says, was deciphering how much about the breach his nonprofit needed to disclose.  Health organizations are required by federal law to report data breaches that affect more than 500 people to the Department of Health and Human Services. The departments Office of Civil Rights publishes the equivalent of a data breach Wall of Shame on its website  which now includes 385 breaches affecting more than 18 million people.  Tripathi said he quickly discovered just how many ways there were to count to 500. The law requires disclosure only in cases that pose a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual affected. His team spent hours poring over a backup of the stolen laptop files. Of the nearly 14,000 patient records on the stolen laptop, most records did not warrant disclosure. In 2,777 cases, for instance, a record listed only a patients name.  Liability issues  Complicating matters were liability rules. In the eyes of the law, Tripathis nonprofit is a contractor that acts on behalf of health providers. The legal burden of protecting patient data actually falls on his clients: the physicians and hospitals who entrusted his nonprofit with their files.  The laws create a perverse outcome, he says. It was our fault, but from a federal perspective, it wasnt our breach.  Tripathi narrowed down the group of patients whose data put them at serious risk for identity theft to 998 people across seven physician practices. Only one practice broke the 500-patient threshold requiring disclosure on the Department of Health and Human Services website.  His office got to work notifying the affected patients of the data breach. They offered free credit monitoring  though less than 10 percent took them up on the option  spending a total of $6,000.  In the aftermath, Tripathi says his company destroyed all patient data on mobile devices and temporarily prohibited employees from removing patient data from clients offices. The company mandates that all data be encrypted, and employees are required to tell health providers what data they will need to access and how they plan to use it.  Breaches are going to be one of the big challenges as more physicians and hospitals adopt electronic health records, Tripathi says.

Our investigation revealed that a user ID and password assigned to a former employee had been used to access information in the Athena system between April, 2013 and March, 2014. Our investigation determined that the information accessed with the user ID and password for the majority of patients included their name, date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number. A small group of patients had additional information accessed which included their name, dates and times of service, provider and facility names, patient account numbers (which may have included Social Security numbers), date of birth, and treatment information, such as diagnosis.  Due to the nature of the access, and out of an abundance of caution to protect our patients, we approached law enforcement, specifically the Secret Service, to assist us with our investigation. The Secret Service asked Bon Secours to delay notifying patients until their investigation was complete so as not to compromise their investigation. The Secret Service worked with Bon Secours to thoroughly investigate this matter and to determine if any patient information may have been used illegally. After discussions with the IRS Identity Task Squad, the Secret Service informed Bon Secours they found no evidence of criminal use of patients information at this time. The Secret Service advised on August 26 that we could send letters to affected patients.  As a precaution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on September 5 and are offering all eligible individuals one year free credit monitoring and identity protection services. We have also established a dedicated call center to assist our patients. If you believe you are affected by this matter, but have not received a notification letter by September 26, please call 877-683-9363 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern Time to speak with a call center agent.  We are deeply sorry that this has occurred.

A physical therapist formerly employed at Howard Head Sports Medicine was discovered to have copied the PHI of patients and taken the data to his new employer. Prior to leaving employment, the physical therapist downloaded patient PHI onto a USB drive on two separate occasions.  VVMC discovered the former employee's HIPAA violations on February 16, 2016. An internal investigation revealed that the physical therapist had inappropriately accessed patient PHI and copied data on December 1, and December 30, 2015.  No Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account details, dates of birth, or addresses were taken, although the former employee did obtain patient names, patient ages, dates of service, amounts paid for medical services, and details of medical diagnoses, conditions, treatments, functional test outcomes, and progress information.  Patients affected by the breach had previously attended the Vail Valley Medical Center or Howard Head Sports Medicine for treatment. VVMC contacted the former employee and requested the return of the stolen data and portable storage devices. Those devices have now been recovered and certification has been obtained confirming that no data have been retained, and copies have been securely destroyed. The Office for Civil Rights and law enforcement have been notified of the HIPAA violation and privacy breach. VVMC has advised patients to exercise caution and to check Explanation of Benefits statements for any sign of fraudulent activity.  This type of HIPAA breach is not uncommon. When healthcare workers leave their employer and go to work for another healthcare provider many are tempted to take patient data with them. While it is difficult to prevent the theft of PHI, healthcare organizations can take a number of steps to reduce the risk of this happening and to ensure that any unauthorized copying of data is rapidly identified.  In an effort to prevent this type of privacy breach from occurring in the future, VVMC has implemented tools that prevent the copying of patient data to portable storage devices and new controls are being developed that will make it easier for staff to monitor for inappropriate accessing of health records by employees. VVMC has also appointed a new member of staff to act as Health Information Manager. The main responsibilities of new role are to strengthen security controls and ensure that patient information is properly safeguarded. Further training has also been provided to staff members on HIPAA Rules and policies and procedures are being updated.",http://www.hipaajournal.com/vail-valley-medical-center-notifies-3118-patients-unauthorized-phi-disclosure-3406/

According to the agreement, from May 2005 to no later than December 29, 2006, some employees of Coventry and/or First Health Priority Services, a subsidiary, inappropriately accessed the Medicare database to obtain Medicare eligibility information for the sale of Medicare set-aside products. A Medicare set-aside is created from a process that allocates a portion of a worker’s compensation settlement to pay future medical expenses that would otherwise be payable by Medicare. Coventry’s actions were intended in part to give Coventry an unfair advantage over its competitors.     Several senior employees were aware of the unauthorized access to the Medicare database, including Coventry’s senior vice president for worker’s compensation services, senior vice president for government programs, senior vice president of service operations and the manager of Medicare enrollment department. All of these individuals have terminated their employment with Coventry.     In January 2007, the CMS contacted Coventry regarding the unauthorized access. Coventry acknowledged that employees had inappropriately accessed the database, and pledged to take corrective action.  In addition to the monetary settlement, Coventry has agreed to maintain new-hire and annual training for all of its employees who have been granted access to government databases, which include mandatory testing on fraud abuse, privacy and security.

Reporters attempted to contact the hospital for a statement to find out whether it was permitted for employees to take confidential healthcare data out of the hospital and how many people were affected, with the Orlando Health issuing a statement on the incident this Wednesday.

""This is one of the hardest areas to police in information security - the knowledgeable insider who understands how to work around the system and its controls,"" he says. ""In this case, the individual understood that to print the information or e-mail it would potentially be caught by security through log monitoring.""  Sentencing Slated Cole, who pled guilty on two counts, faces a maximum prison term of seven years. She is scheduled for sentencing on Sept. 23.  The Justice Department says that last summer, another individual, Alci Bonannee asked Cole to provide Bonannee with personally identifiable information of South Miami Hospital patients. Cole obtained the patient information and provided it to Bonannee, a ringleader in an ID theft and tax fraud scheme, the statement notes.  In April, Bonannee, who was convicted in a trial, was sentenced to more than 26 years in prison, and an accomplice, Sonyini Clay, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 10 years, for their roles in the fraud. The case involved the filing of 2,000 false tax returns seeking $11 million in refunds, according to another Justice Department statement. In March, Chante Mozley, who also pleaded guilty in the same case, was sentenced to 42 months in prison.  ",http://www.govinfosecurity.com/therapist-pleads-guilty-in-fraud-case-a-5918

Health care professionals at some county agencies have access to confidential records through the Meditech system at Samaritan Medical Center to facilitate care for patients in their charge. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, they are not permitted to access records of patients not directly in their care without prior written authorization.  According to Samaritan spokeswoman Krista A. Kittle, a red flag was raised Dec. 20 when a recently installed auditing system alerted the hospitals compliance department to irregular activity associated with the nurses login information. Following an internal investigation at Samaritan, the breach was confirmed Jan. 4. The nurses access to records was shut down that day.  On Jan. 7, Lt. Kristopher M. Spencer, the jail administrator and the nurses supervisor, was notified of the illegal activity.  He met with the compliance department at Samaritan at 9 a.m. the following day. It provided him with a list of patients whose records had been accessed. He checked that list against a list of inmates, and one of the names did not match.  At 1 p.m. that day, Lt. Spencer called the nurse, who had been working for the department for a year and a half, to his office.  I confronted her with the discrepancies. I wanted to know who it was and what the relationship was. She resigned on the spot with no explanation, he said.  Samaritan Medical Center is required to notify the person whose records were breached by mail within 30 days of the Jan. 4 confirmation. Ms. Kittle said the letter would be sent within the next two days.  At that point, it is entirely up to the aggrieved party to decide how to proceed. Action taken against the county could include a civil suit.  A source indicated to the Times that the Sheriffs Department had reported the incident to the state Education Department, which licenses registered nurses to practice in New York state. Sheriff Burns did not return repeated calls to confirm this information.  According to New York Public Health Law, Article 28 facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes are required to report violations of this nature to the Education Department. The county jail is not an Article 28 facility.  According to Lt. Spencer, the nurse was a member of Jefferson County Civil Service Employees Association Local 823.  CSEA President Laurel L. Holt-Simmons said she could not comment on the matter Tuesday because she did not know who the nurse was, and no one had yet reached out to her.  Mrs. Fitzpatrick said she and the board have been working with the sheriff to resolve various allegations against members of the department since the beginning of December.  The board doesnt want to hurt the morale of the department or negatively affect the good work it does protecting the county, she said, but we are going after the bad guys.  Sheriff Burns is waiting for the results of the state investigation into the conduct of Undersheriff Andrew R. Neff, who is accused of sending lewd pictures to a convicted felon using his county-issued cellphone. That case should be resolved this week, the sheriff said Friday.  On Jan. 9, Sheriff Burns charged Deputy Adam B. Hallett with having an open alcoholic beverage container in his patrol vehicle following an investigation into an incident in which Deputy Hallett was found asleep in his vehicle off County Route 72 in the town of Henderson several hours after he went off duty Dec. 1. Deputy Hallett was to be suspended without pay for an undisclosed period.  Sheriff Burns said Deputy Matthew A. Vaughn, who was the first to respond to the call about Deputy Hallett, would face internal disciplinary charges for not taking appropriate action at the scene.  A suit is pending against Detective Steven C. Cote for allegedly deceiving a female deputy into posing nude for photographs meant to be used as part of an online pedophilia investigation.  Corrections Officer Mark H. Kellogg is facing a third-degree assault charge resulting from a bar fight in Adams Center.  Deputy James J. Randall served a 60-day suspension starting in August for having a relationship with a convicted felon, Raven C. Carreira, who accused Detective Cote of making a defamatory statement against her in a suit dismissed Nov. 1.",http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/article/20130116/NEWS03/701169858

On Nov. 5, 2013, it was discovered that a Coulee Medical Center employed physician had shared certain patient information with his wife. The information shared includes: patient account number (a number used solely by the hospital for purposes of identification), date of service, CPT code and description of health care services that the patient received at Coulee Medical Center. The information that was accessed may have, in some instances, also included the patients name.      Coulee Medical Center has taken measures to prevent further access to this information. Coulee Medical Center is committed to providing quality care and protecting patients  personal information, and apologizes for the inconvenience and concern this may be for affected patients.      The affected patients will receive direct mail correspondence from Coulee Medical Center. If you have questions about this incident or concerns about how it may impact you, please contact the Coulee Medical Center Privacy Officer at (509) 633-1753.  Although I havent yet found a copy of the actual notification letter mailed to patients, at least one recipient was not appreciative at all. And the doctor in question, who reportedly was not named in the letter sent to patients, publicly responded and indicated that he felt the medical center had unfairly tarnished his reputation:      In an interview, Dr. Andrew Castrodale said the HIPAA notice, made under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, implied the work had been about figuring out bonus pay, but was actually meant to devise a reliable tool for measuring and reporting the efficiency and productivity of health care providers at Coulee Medical Center.      Although it did not name Castrodale, the Notice of Patient Privacy Breach that arrived in mailboxes Jan. 3 and 4 said the doctor had improperly shared patient information with his wife.      Castrodale said his wife, Sherril, is an actuary, and was helping him build a standardized statistical tool that could be used by Coulee Medical Center.      None of this has to do with anyones medical history, he said.  I find it somewhat shocking that a physician would suggest that PHI that includes CPT codes, description of services, and in some cases, patients names, is not covered by HIPAA or that this was not a big deal  particularly in a small town where people might be recognized by unusual conditions or services.  In any event, unless the physician wishes to claim that PHI is not PHI, it seems hat the doctor shared patients PHI with his wife without authorization or consent of the patients. However noble his intentions, and however much he believes the medical center may have misrepresented his motivation, unless he had consent or a HIPAA waiver, I think its pretty clear he did violate HIPAAs Privacy Rule.  That said, was the hospitals notification accurate and appropriate? Did they have an obligation to explain to recipients that the disclosure to the doctors wife was reportedly so she could provide actuarial advice? Was this, as some of have suggested, a political dirty trick to discredit the doctor? The incident wound up contributing to the medical center hiring new legal counsel:      A majority of hospital district commissioners voted Thursday to immediately hire new legal counsel, then went into closed session with the new attorney.      Commissioner Jerry Kennedy said the boards reasons for changing attorneys had been compounded the week before when the hospital administration mailed a notice of a privacy breach, reportedly to thousands, saying a doctor had violated federal patient privacy rules.      One of the hopes that I had was that _ having legal counsel involved in that would help minimize reputational damage to the institution and to staff that might be potentially involved, Kennedy said. I didnt feel, as a lot of people didnt feel, that that happened.      The HIPAA notice, made under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, came at a time when the hospital administration has been at seemingly irreconcilable odds with its doctors, who have expressed no confidence in administration.  So how does a political controversy factor into a HIPAA breach notification? It shouldnt, of course, and if the medical center did not give patients the information they needed to assess their risk of harm because of any secondary or political agenda, then thats problematic.  Id love to see what HHS does with this one if they get all the facts.  But this is also a useful reminder of why covered entities should consult with lawyers and experts on breach response before making any statements or sending out any notification letters.",http://www.phiprivacy.net/required-hipaa-breach-notification-or-political-dirty-trick/; http://www.grandcoulee.com/story/2014/01/08/opinion/appalled-at-hospitals-letter-on-breach/3467.html; http://www.grandcoulee.com/story/2014/01/15/news/doctor-building-a-tool-for-cmc-didnt-breach-privacy/3491.html; http://www.grandcoulee.com/story/2014/01/15/news/hospital-commission-forces-switch-in-attorneys/3488.html

Ms Cowan said: A sheet containing certain medical information about seven patients was found by a member of the public outside the hospital. These are known as handover notes and are used by staff changing shift. These should not have left the hospital but it is not as yet clear how they came to be found in a public area.  An investigation is being carried out and I will be writing personally to the patients or families concerned to apologise.  Ms Cowan added: This breach of confidentiality is very disappointing.

The initial audit resulted in identification and notification of 14 individuals on October 21, 2014. Following its policy, CPMC terminated its relationship with the employee and broadened the investigation  The expanded investigation identified a total of 844 patients whose records the employee may have accessed without an apparent business or treatment purpose. It is unclear whether all of these records were accessed inappropriately but, out of an abundance of caution, CPMC notified all of these patients.   CPMC has determined that between October 2013 and October 2014, the employee accessed the following types of information without an apparent valid purpose: patient demographics, last four digits of social security number, clinical information including diagnosis and clinical notes, and prescription information. The type of information varied for each patient. While the employee potentially viewed the last four digits of some social security numbers, the employee did not have access to full Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, California identification numbers, credit card numbers or financial account information. CPMC has no evidence of a malicious intent or any unauthorized sharing of patient information by the employee. CPMC believes that the employee accessed the information out of curiosity.

Dana J. Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; and Andrew G. McCabe, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBIs Washington Field Office, made the announcement after Ebrahimis initial appearance today in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson. If convicted, Ebrahimi faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each wire fraud count, 10 years in prison on each health care fraud count, a mandatory two-year consecutive sentence for each of the aggravated identity theft counts, and five years in prison on each count of making a false claim regarding health care matters. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Criminal indictments are only charges and not evidence of guilt. A defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty. According to allegations in the indictment, Ebrahimi, a law school graduate, owned and controlled Dental Arts Group, which purported to provide administrative and consulting services to dental practices. Through her control of Dental Arts Group, Ebrahimi allegedly carried out a scheme to steal the identities of various individuals, including other dentists, and use their identities without their knowledge to open merchant accounts with consumer dental financing programs, including CareCredit. To gain access to these programs, Ebrahimi submitted false and misleading enrollment applications. Once the fraudulent CareCredit merchant accounts were opened, Ebrahimi allegedly billed patients for charges that were inflated, never authorized, or never approved. For example, under one CareCredit merchant account that Ebrahimi opened without the victims knowledge, patients disputed nearly 50 percent of the total amount Ebrahimi charged for purported dental services. At the time, the dispute rate for all other CareCredit dental merchants was less than 1 percent. Furthermore, Ebrahimi allegedly submitted false CareCredit charge slips that purported to bear the signatures of patients. The indictment further alleges that Ebrahimi defrauded Humana, a private health insurer, by submitting false and inflated insurance claims for dental services that were never rendered. Ebrahimi allegedly deposited the profits earned from her scheme in various bank accounts that she controlled. Finally, the indictment alleges that Ebrahimi manufactured, or attempted to manufacture, and destroy various patient records. This case is being investigated by the FBIs Washington Field Office. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Lowell and Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye are prosecuting the case.

Cowell said he found the documents in the dumpster at the start of a recent shift at his Ridgewood Avenue store, so he took photos of the papers and called authorities.  When you go to a doctor, you don't think they would go and peddle your records or throw them away in the dumpster, Herbert Weems said.  Weems is one of the patients whose personal information was left in the trash. He said the found documents are disturbing, since he has already been a victim of identity theft once before.

Whismans attorneys stated that she was asked not to immediately alert patients of the data breach to avoid interfering with the theft ring investigation. She was allowed to send notifications in August.  The breach has not been included on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) public breach list, and the letter sent to patients makes no mention of HHS notification, though information may have been sent.  Patients were urged to check their credit reports and were offered free credit monitoring services. Whisman believes that her offices procedures make a future incident improbable.

Officials said the security breach, which happened on June 6, prompted an internal review and the discovery of a second breach in 2012 in which less detailed information about more than 6,000 patients was mistakenly sent to job applicants. In both cases, the files were sent as training files to evaluate the skills of job applicants, Rady officials said.  The information breach was the result of human error, and the hospitals computers systems were never compromised, officials said.  According to Ben Metcalf, a hospital media relations representative, the file sent to four job applicants on June 6 was a spreadsheet containing information on 14,121 patients. It included patients names, dates of birth, primary diagnoses, admit/discharge dates, medical record numbers, and other information including insurance carrier and claim information. The file did not contain social security, insurance or credit card numbers, street addresses, or parent and guardian names.  Once the breach was discovered, hospital employees contacted all four of the job applicants. They learned that one of them forwarded the file to a two other people. The hospital then hired security specialists to verify that the files had been deleted from the recipients computers and digital devices.  The hospital notified everyone on the patient list they could by telephone and sent out letters explaining the breach to everyone on the list on June 16, Metcalf said.  The investigation revealed that a similar breach happened in August, November and December of 2012, when an employee mailed a file containing information on 6,307 patients to three job applicants as part of the evaluation process. That file had less information and did not include dates of birth, diagnoses, street addresses, or social security, insurance or credit card numbers. The hospital plans to notify the patients involved as soon as possible, Metcalf said.  Hospital officials apologized to the families of patients affected by the breaches and said they were taking steps to prevent similar breaches in the future, including:  using commercial testing programs to evaluate job candidates only onsite, increasing email security to require additional approvals before sensitive information can be sent, using email encryption to protect sensitive data, and educating employees about privacy policies.",http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/18/4186057/patient-data-breach-at-san-diego.html; http://fox5sandiego.com/2014/06/18/hospital-admits-releasing-sensitive-patient-info-by-mistake/#axzz35BzI90rJ; http://www.rchsd.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/files-containing-patient-information-released-in-error/

Janice Nieman, 49, of Milwaukee is charged with four felonies  three counts of theft over $10,000 and one count of identity theft for a scheme that dates back to 2004.  According to the complaint, Nieman admitted to the theft and told Glendale police she used much of the money to play the slots at Potawatomi Bingo Casino.  Nieman started gambling before she took the position at Wheaton 15 years ago, the complaint said. She started playing the slots to deal with the stress when she lost her previous job.  The complaint alleges from 2004 through June of this year, Nieman made more than 2,000 fraudulent transactions through the health care organization's payroll system, using the identities of 848 different employees, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1dLxBYf ) reported.  Nieman was responsible for payroll processing at several different Wheaton locations. According to the complaint, she allegedly embezzled the money through creating phantom paid time-off for different employees, then directing the money into her own accounts.  The employees neither earned nor used the time off, but it was listed in their payroll records when Nieman generated the fraudulent pay, the complaint said. To cover her tracks, she shredded the paper records generated by the system, designed to notify employees of the payments.  In April, Wheaton switched to a new payroll system that allowed employees to view their payroll information online. At that time, Nieman stopped using payroll information for active employees and instead used the identities of former employees, who would no longer be able to access the online payroll system, the complaint said. The fraud was discovered when one of the former employees was re-hired and noticed a discrepancy in her online records.  Nieman was fired from Wheaton in July. She is scheduled to make her initial court appearance Dec. 20.  A working home telephone number for Nieman could not be found.

It was in its best interest of Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center to pay the ransom of 40 bitcoins  currently worth $16,664 dollars  after the network infiltration that began Feb. 5, CEO Allen Stefanek said in a statement.  In the attacks, often known as ""ransomware,"" the hackers encrypt a network's data and provide a digital decryption key to unlock it for a price.  ""The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,"" Stefanek said. ""In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.""  Hospital employees noticed the network problems on Feb. 5, and it became clear there was a malware infiltration that was disabling the network.  Computer experts and law enforcement were immediately informed, Stefanek said. On Monday, 10 days after the attack, the network was in full operation again, he said.  FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency is investigating the extortion plot, but she could not immediately provide further details.  Neither law enforcement nor the hospital gave any indication of who might have been behind the attack or whether there are any suspects.  Patient care was not affected by the hacking, and there is no evidence any patient data was compromised, Stefanek said.  The 434-bed hospital in the Los Feliz area of Los Angeles was founded in 1924.

He did so by altering the figures on withdrawal forms and using a photocopy of an authorising signature. The court heard that Garcia, of Fortunes Walk, City Park, Saggart, has since repaid the money.

He has no previous convictions.  Vulnerable  Judge Desmond Hogan accepted that Garcia co-operated with the garda investigation but noted that the money was stolen from vulnerable people whom he had taken advantage of.  He said because of the disabilities of the residents, Garcia's plea had assisted the gardai.  The withdrawal forms had to be approved by the manager of Cheeverstown and the money would then be taken from the clients' accounts to allow them to pay for cinema trips, for dinner or to go shopping.

(Kaiser) alleging a violation of Californias unfair competition law (Business and Professions Code sections 17200-17210) arising out of a personal information security breach and delayed notification.  This lawsuit is interesting because the AGs office alleges that the timing of Kaisers notification violated Californias breach notification law (California Civil Code section 1798.82, subdivision (a)).  It also comes on the heels of the Target breach where people are questioning  Targets 3-week delay in providing its initial notification.  As discussed further below the fold, the outcome of this case could impact when and how companies subject to Californias breach notice law provide notice to affected individuals.  Moreover, considering Californias influence in the privacy regulatory space it could have nationwide implications.   Section 1798.82 of Californias breach notification law provides as follows (emphasis supplied): Any person or business that conducts business in California, and that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, shall disclose any breach of the security of the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the security of the data to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. The disclosure shall be made in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, as provided in subdivision (c), or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. While Californias law does not explicitly define most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, Californias Office of Privacy Protection recommends that notice be provided within ten (10) business days of an organizations determination that personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.  With respect to Kaiser, the CA AG alleges that on September 24, 2011, Kaiser learned that an external hard drive containing the personal information (SSNs, DOBs, addresses, etc.) of Kaiser employees had been sold to a member of the public at a thrift store.  On December 21, 2011 Kaiser secured possession of the drive and conducted a forensic examination.   The initial forensic examination allegedly revealed the presence of over 30,000 SSNs and other personal information.  According to the CA AG, Kaiser continued its inventory of the drive through mid-Feburary 2012 (approximately 5 months after initial discovery and 3 months after obtaining the drive).  Still later, Kaiser provided notice to 20,539 California residents on March 19, 2012 (approximately 6 months after its initial discover and 4 months after obtaining the drive).  Based on the facts set forth above, the CA AG alleges that Kaisers delay between obtaining the drive in December 2011 and notification to affected individuals in March 2012 amounts to an act of of unfair competition under section 17200 of Californias Business and Professions code.  In particular, the CA AG alleges that even though Kaiser did not complete its analysis of the drive until February 2012, it had sufficient information to notify at least some affected individuals between December 2011 and February 2012.  In the eyes of the CA AG, the failure of Kaiser to provide notice on a rolling basis, even if its investigation was not complete, amounted to a failure to provide notice in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay under Californias breach notice law (California Civil Code section 1798.82, subdivision (a)).  Under Californias Business and Professions code section 17206, Kaiser could be ordered to pay $2,500 for each violation of section 17200 (if late notice to each affected individual is a separate violation, Kaiser could be looking at significant penalties).

An Orlando district judge ruled Nov. 3 that Hynes violated two federal privacy laws and breached a confidentiality agreement with Health First when he gained access to the email account of another physician. The breach occurred at Holmes Regional Medical Center in 2009, when Hynes was chief of staff of the Melbourne hospital.  Judge Carlos Mendoza ordered Hynes to pay nearly $61,000 in damages to Health First after the two-day, nonjury civil trail.

Legal experts say the case is a reminder to healthcare entities and their business associates to conduct background checks on prospective employees and take other measures to prevent and detect breaches involving insiders.  In an Oct. 28 statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said a federal grand jury on Oct. 27 indicted Sherice Joan Williams, of North Las Vegas, on one count of illegal use and disclosure of patient health information and one count of aggravated identity theft. Williams pleaded not guilty to the charges. The FBI handled the investigation in collaboration with local police.  Prosecutors say Williams, between about Dec. 1, 2014, and Jan. 27, 2015, while working as a laboratory technician at an unnamed Las Vegas pediatric cardiology practice, allegedly accessed a patient's information without authorization and then used it to apply for credit cards without the patient's knowledge.  Criminal History Previously, Williams was convicted on a felony charge of submitting false Medicaid claims, according to a Nov. 4, 2013, statement from the Nevada's state attorney general's office. She was then sentenced to serve 12 to 48 months in prison and pay about $10,000 in restitution, penalties and costs.  In that case, prosecutors alleged that Williams, while working for a North Las Vegas behavioral health services firm, had submitted false documentation for services she never provided to a Medicaid recipient. The investigation found that Williams submitted progress notes and subsequent Medicaid claims for time periods where the Medicaid recipient was not receiving the behavioral health services, according to a statement from the Nevada state attorney general's office. The fraud occurred between February and May 2012.  Nevada parole board records indicate that even though Williams was sentenced in November 2013 to serve one to four years for the Medicaid fraud crimes, she was granted parole from a state prison a few weeks later, on Nov. 25, 2013, and then was released from prison on Jan. 22, 2014. Parole was granted because Williams had earned credits while serving another concurrent sentence for a previous fraud-related case, a Nevada parole board spokesman says.  Parole records indicate that Williams' parole was subsequently revoked on March 19, 2015, and she is currently serving out her Medicaid fraud sentence, the spokesman says.  Crane Pomerantz, assistant U.S. Attorney in the Nevada district who is lead prosecutor in the Williams case, declined to comment on the case or the defendant's previous criminal record, and how that potentially could affect sentencing if Williams is convicted on the new ID theft and criminal HIPAA violations.  In a statement, prosecutors note that if convicted, Williams faces up to 10 years in prison on the health information charge and a minimum of two years consecutive on the aggravated identity theft charge, plus maximum fines of $250,000 on each count.  Preventive Measures Healthcare fraud experts say the Williams case is a warning to other healthcare entities and business associates about the need to scrutinize prospective and current workforce members.  ""In commentary to the HIPAA Security Rule, the Department of Health and Human Services states that 'the need for and extent of a screening process is normally based on an assessment of risk, cost, benefit, and feasibility as well as other protective measures in place,'"" notes privacy attorney Adam Greene of the law firm David Wright Tremaine.  ""Organizations may wish to consider what information individuals will have access to, and what is the risk that they will use that information for their own financial gain, such as for identity theft purposes. This may lead to more focused background checks, with more stringent standards applied to workforce members who will have access to Social Security numbers, credit card numbers and other high-risk information.""  While background checks can help vet employees, they're not foolproof, notes privacy attorney Kirk Nahra of the law firm Wiley Rein.  ""Background checks are important, and healthcare companies should do them generally, but they aren't perfect,"" he says. ""Insider threats are a real and significant issue. In my personal experience, insider problems are far more likely to lead to actual harm than many external breaches.""  Insiders with bad intentions can take exactly what they need for bad purposes, Nahra says. ""This is a consistent and ongoing problem,"" he says. As a result, healthcare organizations must educate their staff on the consequences of inappropriate data access and then monitor their activity, he says.  ""People have to know they will get caught and that they will get fired,"" he says. ""But it is hard to balance access to data to get your job done with strong controls and an effective monitoring problem.""  The recent attention on major cyberattacks in the healthcare sector should not divert organizations from addressing insider threats, Nahra stresses. ""But sometimes the focus on hackers ... distracts from this current, ongoing, significant problem with insider threats.""

But at least one patient insists that research shouldnt include letting the actors in to watch you get a rectal exam.  Thats what Walter Fisher claims happened two years ago when he was at the Brampton Civic Hospital. Dressed in medical garb, he assumed the man and woman accompanying his doctor were medical students or fellow physicians. Instead, he claims, he later learned they were really from CTVs medical drama Saving Hope and were watching his invasive physical examination  and may have even participated  without his knowledge or consent.  Fisher has just filed a $100,000 lawsuit against the William Osler Health System, which oversees Brampton Civic, his doctor and a number of people and companies connected with the Canadian TV show, claiming assault and battery and a breach of privacy.  None of the allegations have been proven in court and no statements of defence have yet been filed.  He was shocked, he was completely shocked and very upset, said his lawyer, Douglas Elliott. Hes a very private person and the idea that strangers were looking at him in those circumstances was humiliating and a gross violation of his privacy.  He certainly wouldnt have agreed to let them stay in the room during his rectal exam.  Saving Hope, CTVs hit medical drama that takes place in the fictional Hope Zion Hospital, debuted in 2012 and is now in its third season. The show prides itself on working with 20 medical professionals across the GTA. If we dont do our research properly, our viewers will know and they will feel shortchanged, show writer and researcher Maggie Gilmour said in a St. Josephs Health Centre publication two years ago.  Which is all well and good, except Fisher insists that their research didnt involve his consent.  He went to the emergency room at Brampton Civic Hospital on Oct. 18, 2012 with gastrointestinal problems. In his claim, Fisher said he was seen by a doctor as well as a man and a woman he later identified as actors or possibly a show researcher. All were dressed as medical personnel.  (They) did not inform the Plaintiff that the only purpose of the Defendants ... being in attendance was to conduct background research for their television show Saving Hope, the statement alleges.  He accuses the doctor, Brampton Civic and William Osler of intentionally and/or negligently misrepresenting the true identities and intent of the Saving Hope staff.  While the two were in the room, Fisher said his doctor did a rectal exam. According to his lawyer, the Brampton man was lying on his back and he could feel more than one set of hands on him. In his lawsuit, he alleges he was a victim of assault and battery.  He also contends the hospital breached his privacy by discussing his medical history, condition, symptoms and charts with the pair from Saving Hope without his informed consent.  A spokesman for ICF Films, which produces the TV show, dismissed Fishers claims. Unfortunately, people can sue for all kinds of things, whether they have a basis or not, said Kathy Avrich-Johnson. We dont think hes got any case at all.  The hospital wouldnt comment specifically on his allegations but issued a statement saying that under no circumstances would Osler permit anyone outside of the patients care team to attend or observe patient treatment or consultations without the patients knowledge or consent.  The two-year statute of limitations was nearing when Fisher filed his lawsuit on Oct. 14 but his lawyer is optimistic that a settlement can be reached.  They really put their desire to help the actors above their duty to their patients, and that really should come first, said Elliott. I dont think this type of thing happens very often and hopefully it wont happen again.",http://www.torontosun.com/2014/10/31/actors-witness-rectal-exam-lawsuit

The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) opened a compliance review of SRMC following a Los Angeles Times article which indicated two SRMC senior leaders had met with media to discuss medical services provided to a patient.  OCRs investigation indicated that SRMC failed to safeguard the patients protected health information (PHI) from impermissible disclosure by intentionally disclosing PHI to multiple media outlets on at least three separate occasions, without a valid written authorization. OCRs review indicated that senior management at SRMC impermissibly shared details about the patients medical condition, diagnosis and treatment in an email to the entire workforce.  In addition, SRMC failed to sanction its workforce members for impermissibly disclosing the patients records pursuant to its internal sanctions policy.  When senior level executives intentionally and repeatedly violate HIPAA by disclosing identifiable patient information, OCR will respond quickly and decisively to stop such behavior, said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. Senior leadership helps define the culture of an organization and is responsible for knowing and complying with the HIPAA privacy and security requirements to ensure patients rights are fully protected.  In addition to a $275,000 monetary settlement, a corrective action plan (CAP) requires SRMC to update its policies and procedures on safeguarding PHI from impermissible uses and disclosures and to train its workforce members.  The CAP also requires fifteen other hospitals or medical centers under the same ownership or operational control as SRMC to attest to their understanding of permissible uses and disclosures of PHI, including disclosures to the media.

Joyce Jennings worked as a registered nurse at the Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust, when she accessed records she wasnt privy to.  Jennings, who brought her 30 years experience into disrepute, was suspended to work as a nurse for 18 months following a hearing and subsequently dismissed from the Trust for breach of confidentiality.  A report from the Nursing and Midwifery hearing last week said: Mrs Jennings used her privileged position to breach Trust confidentiality policies when she accessed and attempted to access Patient As medical records.  The panel considered that a nurse with 30 years experience should be fully aware of basic data protection. The panel also noted that Mrs Jennings accessed these medical records for her own sole interest and discussed her actions via social media.  Mrs Jennings actions fell short of the standards expected from a registered nurse and were sufficiently serious to constitute misconduct.  Jennings admitted accessing or attempting to access the records of a patient, known as Patient A, who she had no clinical involvement with, on February 21 2013, March 4, 2013, April 19, 2013 and April 22, 2013.  The probe was launched when the patient made the referral to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.  It came to the patients attention when it was seen on social media.  Jennings told a Nursing and Midwifery hearing that she was embarrassed by her actions.  A report from the hearing said: I have to add that I am really embarrassed and ashamed of my actions. I am thoroughly aware that I have acted in an unprofessional manner and that I have breached patient confidentiality and the protocols and policies of the Trust.  I am genuinely upset and remorseful for this situation arising and is completely out of character. I find the whole situation far from comical and it was never my intention to bring the Trust into disrepute.  Jennings was handed an interim suspension order for 18 months.  She was dismissed by the Trust for breach of confidentiality on October 25, 2013.  The panel said there was no evidence that physical harm was caused to Patient A by Jennings actions but she brought the profession into disrepute.  A Trust spokeswoman said: The Trust are aware of this case and the individual is no longer employed by the Trust.  The Trust is aware that the Nursing and Midwifery Council have been progressing the matter and the outcome published on the Nursing and Midwifery Council website.",http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-nurse-sacked-after-snooping-8581684

Multiple sources told The Observer Monday as many as 17 people were dismissed after non-clinical staff accessed patient information through a password-protected system  without authorization  earlier this month.  Sources told The Observer that at least part of the information accessed is related to the persons charged in the murder of 27-year-old Sarnia teacher Noelle Paquette.  Karen Waymouth, chief information and privacy officer, said she couldn't confirm whether employees were fired, citing the privacy and confidentiality of the investigation.  We do uphold a policy of confidentiality here and that we do have a policy in place if a breach occurs, she said. The appropriate action was taken.  Waymouth did not divulge specifics  what information was accessed, how many people were affected, what type of non-clinical staff were involved, or what they were doing with the information.  It's due to the privacy and confidentiality of the individuals, the people who's charts were accessed, and also the staff that were involved, she said.  Staff had access to the computer system because of their jobs at Bluewater Health, Waymouth said. The breach was confirmed after a random audit and employee interviews.  She did say fewer than 17 staff members were involved in the breach, but wouldn't confirm the exact number.  Waymouth contacted patients affected by the breach personally and apologized, she said, noting their reactions, when she called, were of disappointment.  The police were not notified, she said, but Bluewater Health was planning to contact the Information and Privacy Commission.  Mandatory orientation sessions at Bluewater Health cover privacy and confidentiality, and require employees, physicians, volunteers and students to sign a pledge of confidentiality  enforced by hospital policy and law, Bluewater Health officials said in a news release.  Patient confidentiality and patient care are part of a balancing act when it comes to personal information, Waymouth said.  Unauthorized or inappropriate access to electronic patient information is viewed with zero tolerance.  Staff are planning to re-educate all staff, students, volunteers and physicians about Bluewater Health's policy, she said, adding hospital officials do value and trust staff.  It's disappointing when a policy is not followed and we're unable to fulfill our obligation to protect patient privacy, she said.",http://www.theobserver.ca/2013/01/28/privacy-breach-at-bluewater-health; http://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2013/01/28/patient-privacy-breach/

An employee whose job required access to some patient records viewed thousands of additional records ""without a job-related purpose"" from June 2011 to March 2015, the hospital said in a statement.  It was unclear what the employee did with the sensitive information, which included patient names, birthdays, heights and weights, medical record numbers, home addresses, diagnoses, test orders and results, medications and employment status.  Outside experts analyzed the employee's hard drive and e-mail account and found no evidence that the records had been downloaded or distributed via e-mail, said hospital spokesman John Murray.  It does not appear social security numbers, driver's licenses or state ID card numbers, or credit or debit card information were accessed or distributed, the statement said.  Still, the hospital is offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to those affected.  Hospital officials notified university police in March, after reviewing the employee's access patterns. Murray said that review was triggered by a tip from someone other than a patient.  Murray said he could not comment on whether the employee was still working for UC Irvine, but did say the employee had been disciplined and no longer has access to the hospital's computer systems.  Health care data breaches are a persistent threat, said Dr. Vincent Liu, the lead author of a study published in April in the Journal of the American Medical Association that found almost 30 million health records nationwide were impacted by criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches from 2010 to 2013.  The study didn't examine motives behind criminal breaches, or how stolen data might have been used, but cyber-security experts say thieves may try to use patients' personal information to fraudulently obtain medical services.  That's a possibility in this case, said Gene Tsudik, a UC Irvine professor who researches computer network security and privacy.  Information on physical characteristics could also be sold to spammers on the web's black market to sell diet products, herbal supplements and the like. More sinisterly, a patient's medical information could be used in a blackmail scheme, Tsudik said.  There are ways other than downloading and e-mailing by which the employee could have recorded the information, Tsudik said, including writing it down or taking photos with a cell phone.  ""Let's keep our fingers crossed. Maybe they haven't sold or leaked the information yet, maybe they never intended to.

Officials believe the incident took place sometime between March 12 and March 14. The vehicle was later recovered, but the mail on the truck was not. It is unclear where or when the truck was found. The mail delivery truck contained ""Evidence of Coverage"" handbooks for Kaiser Permanente California Medi-Cal members in Southern California who are part of the Inland Empire Health Plan. It was not parked in a secure area, which violated Kaiser's vendor mail delivery policies, officials said in a news release. The stolen property contained protected health information, including names, addresses and the handbooks, which provide a generic overview of plan benefits. It did not include Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, descriptions of any medical services, health status or financial and account information, officials said.

The disclosure comes days after controversial plans to extract patient data from GP files were put on hold, amid concerns over the scheme. Those in charge of the programme have repeatedly insisted that it will be illegal for information extracted from GP files to be sold to insurers, who might seek to target customers or put up their prices. However, a report by a major society of actuaries discloses that it was able to obtain 13 years of hospital data  covering 47 million patients  in order to help insurance companies refine their premiums. The report by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries details how it was able to use NHS data covering all hospital in-patient stays between 1997 and 2010 to track the medical histories of patients, identified by date of birth and postcode.  It boasts that uniquely they were able to combine these details with information from credit ratings agencies, such as Experian, which record the lifestyle habits of milllions of consumers. The calculations were used to advise companies how to refine their premiums. The report advises that levels of illness among most customers below the age of 50 were found to be higher than previous calculations had found. As a result of the work, insurers were likely to increase premiums for this group, experts said. The 274-page report describes the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics as a valuable data source in developing pricing assumptions for 'critical illness cover. It says that by combining hospital data with socio-economic profiles, experts were able to better calculate the likelihood of conditions, with amazingly clear forecasts possible for certain diseases, in particular lung cancer. Phil Booth, from privacy campaign group medConfidential, said: The language in the document is extraordinary; this isnt about patients, this is about exploiting a market. Of course any commercial organisation will focus on making a profit  the question is why is the NHS prepared to hand this data over? He added: We have been categorically told that it would be illegal for GP data to be handed over to insurers, yet already all this hospital data has been extracted. It blows out of the water the idea that patients privacy is being protected. Last week Tim Kelsey, director for patients and information at NHS England, said it will be a criminal offence for any information entered into the new giant database, which will combine GP and hospital records, to be sold for insurance purposes. However, a database which only contains hospital records remains a separate entity, with its own rules allowing greater access to third parties. There has been a growing backlash against the scheme with family doctors and privacy campaigners raising fears that data could be misused. Those behind the 50million data-sharing plan say it will improve healthcare and help medical research. Last week NHS officials announced a six-month delay to the plans, to address concerns and improve publicity. Speaking after the delay was announced, Mr Kelsey said the database needed to go ahead because it was vital to improving Britains cancer survival rates. On Tuesday, the Commons health select committee is due to question NHS officials leading the scheme and to hear concerns from privacy campaigners. In the report based on hospital data, actuaries used the information as the basis for detailed calculations about the incidence of common health conditions. It describes a falling market in 'critical illness insurance cover, with sales dropping by almost half in a decade, and suggests estimates of prevalence for major conditions including Alzheimers disease are likely to be significantly underestimated, because they are based on the hospital figures, when most care is provided outside hospitals. The Department of Health said: ""The rules changed last year so this would no longer be allowed. Information like this can only be accessed now if there is a clear benefit to improving health or health systems.""",http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10656893/Hospital-records-of-all-NHS-patients-sold-to-insurers.html

Her statement follows the break-in of the North Lincoln County Community Health Center Clinic at 4422 N.E. Devils Lake Blvd., in Lincoln City. ""Plus we now have the added expenses of having to replace things that are grant funded. We run on a shoestring budget, so it is hard when you have a hit like that,"" said Gantz. During the evening of April 17, the Clinic and surrounding offices in the same building, were broken into by an unknown person or persons, according to a release from Casey Miller, Lincoln County public information officer. Locked doors, rooms and cabinets were forcibly entered. Money was taken from the clinic, but it appears no other records or materials were removed. No electronic devices were taken or accessed. However, the locked room which contains medical charts for clients was breached. These files contain protected health information and may also contain information such as social security numbers and personal financial information. Lincoln County has identified and notified the clients whose protected health information and personal information was in those files. ""In accordance with law and standard practices in these situations we are notifying clients of this breach of our security because this information potentially could be compromised, "" said Casey. ""The charts have been secured and security at the clinic is being enhanced. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that there was an attempt to obtain or use any protected health or personal information."" But Casey said there is always some risk in these situations, so Lincoln County is contacting the three major credit reporting agencies about the incident and has given those agencies a general report, alerting them to the fact that the incident occurred. ""There is a potential that protected health information could have been breached,"" said Gantz. ""That's why we are notifying all our clients."" Letters were sent to about 1,000 North Lincoln County Community Health Clinic clients on June 13. ""We want our clients to make sure their personal financial records are secure,"" said Gantz. ""Just in case. It is due diligence to make sure that our clients are taken care of."" Gantz said none of the computers, other electronic equipment and medical supplies were disturbed. ""It appears that the suspect or suspects knew how to effectively use a crow bar. We have to replace several desks and several doors that were damaged by the crow bar."" She said the clinics safe was also broken into and about $170 taken. The News Guard's calls to Lincoln City Police detectives about suspect information have not been returned as of June 18. Gantz said public notification of the break-in was delayed due to the investigation circumstances and the need to first notify clinic clients. Clients were given a recommendation to monitor their financial accounts and promptly contact the financial institution if any unauthorized activity is observed. Clients can also submit an identity theft complaint to the Federal Trade Commission by calling toll free to 1-877-ID THEFT (1-877-438-4338 or online at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/ Clients may also want to contact the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) to obtain a free credit report from each by calling 1-877-322-8228 or online at www.annualcreditreport.com. Even if suspicious activity is not found on initial credit reports, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recommends that credit reports be checked periodically Consumer protection laws allow people to place a security freeze or a fraud alert on their credit files. By placing a freeze, someone who fraudulently acquires personal identifying information will not be able to use the information to open new accounts or borrow money in another persons name. An alert places a statement in the credit file that notifies anyone requesting a copy of the credit report that the person may be the victim of an ID theft. Generally, if an identity theft complaint is filed with the FTC as outlined above, there may be no charge to place the freeze. If, however, any client involved in this incident is charged and pays a cost from the credit reporting agency associated with this option, they can contact the county at the address below and provide documentation of payment to be reimbursed. Lincoln County will provide additional information concerning identity theft on its website at www.co.lincoln.or.us. Lincoln County takes the role of safeguarding the personal information of clients very seriously and is doing everything it can to prevent this situation in the future.

The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the clients  mostly seniors who need care at home  were listed for all 121. Fifty-eight clients received a special written warning about potential identity theft because the missing record book also included their personal health numbers and, in three cases, an access code to the lockbox containing a key to their home.  No security problems have been reported to Fraser Health since the letters were sent out on Oct. 3, says the authoritys public affairs officer Erin Labb.  The loss of personal and private information is extremely concerning. We know that this type of situation can be very upsetting for our clients, and we apologize for the worry and trouble that it may cause, she said.  A worker from Newton Home Health, which provides nursing and other medical services to patients in their homes, noticed the book was missing on Sept. 25. A subsequent search came up with nothing, says Labb.  Its not clear if it was lost or stolen or dropped on the ground.  The letter also advises clients to check bank and credit card statements for irregularities and says Fraser Health will pay for a one-year subscription to a credit monitoring service that reports on changes to a persons credit rating.  Dana Miller lives with her 92-year-old grandmother, who received the warning letter. She has since increased security on her grandmothers bank accounts after changing her homes access code.  This has undone what Ive done to protect her. ... Now our security is jeopardized, said Miller in a telephone interview.  I just dont know that the system is safe for seniors.  The risk of identity theft  or worse  means in-home workers should only carry information thats properly encrypted, Miller adds.  Labb says Fraser Health is asking its workers to keep record books in locked containers rather than carry them from job to job unprotected. Home care case mangers have laptop computers with encryption features to protect client information, but the health authority doesnt have enough resources to provide the same equipment to all nurses who work in peoples homes, she says.  Miller says thats not good enough and that adequate encryption tools are even available for smartphones.  Why is there one set of rules for some employees and not a blanket set of rules for all, particularly when youre talking about seniors? Miller asks.  Fraser Health reported the breach to the B.C.s Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, which confirmed this week than an investigation is underway, but has received no formal complaints to date.

Forteau, 30, pleaded guilty to the same charges two weeks ago in state Supreme Court, St. George.  Forteau and his fianc, Amanda (Meme Zee) Zieminski, 27, of West Brighton, stole the identities of about 80 patients from a Great Kills doctor's office, prosecutors said.  Ms. Zieminski worked as a licensed practical nurse at the doctor's office, South Shore Physicians Group on Hylan Boulevard, and used her position to steal patient files and typically targeted people in their 70s, prosecutors said. When detectives realized they picked many of their victims by age, prosecutors were allowed to charge them with hate crimes, according to Donovan's office.  She and other conspirators used personal information to raid bank accounts and apply for credit cards, and used the money to treat themselves to field-level seats at a Jets game and to Game 6 of the NBA semifinals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics.  Among their lavish trips was one to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.  In April of last year, Ms. Zieminski trumpeted her engagement to Forteau in a public Facebook post.  ""Yesterday was the greatest day of my life. My love asked me to marry him in Cinderella's Castle, glass slipper and all,"" she wrote.  Ms. Zieminski pleaded guilty to second-degree grand larceny. She'll be sentenced Sept. 8 in state Supreme Court, St. George, to no less than one to three years in prison and no more than two and a third to seven years behind bars.  In all, they stole at least $675,000, prosecutors said.",http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/bronx_man_senetenced_to_at_lea.html

But the Coroners Service says it does not believe the photos have appeared online or anywhere else, and the service has reminded all coroners to keep their items secure.  The privacy breach, which occurred in August but is only now surfacing publicly after a Freedom of Information request by The Globe and Mail, is believed by the service to be the only one of its kind in its history.  A briefing note prepared for B.C. Justice Minister Suzanne Anton says a coroner forgot her briefcase, containing the camera and a binder, at a Surrey bus shelter on Aug. 6. The briefing note was prepared one week later and written by chief coroner Lisa Lapointe.  The one-page note says by the time the coroner __ who is not identified __ realized her error and returned to the bus stop, her briefcase and its contents were gone.  ""Personal information at risk includes photos of the deceased and of their scenes of death,"" the note says.  It goes on to say the binder ""contained the coroner's investigative notes for several files including names and contact information for family members.""  The briefing note says the Coroners Service planned to contact individuals whose privacy may have been compromised, including the nearest relatives of the deceased.  Barbara McLintock, a Coroners Service spokeswoman, in an interview Sunday said the incident was reported to Surrey RCMP and transit police, but the briefcase and its contents were never found.  She said the Coroners Service has not had any similar incidents since August, and could not recall any before.  The spokeswoman said none of the relatives of the deceased were contacted by whoever took the briefcase. Ms. McLintock would not provide details on the Coroners Service's communication with family members, except to say, ""They're not conversations you'd like to have.""  Ms. McLintock said the provincial government has protocols in place for privacy breaches. She said the Coroners Service worked in conjunction with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for B.C. and the government's chief information officer.  The spokeswoman said she could not disclose whether the coroner who forgot the briefcase was disciplined, due to privacy concerns.  When asked whether the Coroners Service implemented any changes as a result of the breach, Ms. McLintock said, ""A reminder was sent to everybody to try and keep a close eye on your things, but also to try and get all your information downloaded onto the secure servers as fast as you can.""  The briefing note said the camera and binder ""did not contain any information potentially harmful to law enforcement or police investigations.""  Ms. Anton was unavailable for comment Sunday. Jeff Groot, a Ministry of Justice spokesman, in an e-mail said any privacy incident is concerning, ""particularly one like this, as these families were already in a difficult time in their lives after losing a loved one.""  Mr. Groot said the ministry is confident the Coroners Service followed all of the appropriate steps to not only try to recover the camera and binder, but also to notify those affected.  A Surrey RCMP spokesman did not respond to a message seeking comment.  A document on the website of the province's chief information officer describes the process for responding to privacy breaches. It says the chief information officer is responsible for the co-ordination, investigation and resolution of ""information incidents"" and defines such incidents as ""unwanted or unexpected events that threaten privacy or information security.""",http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/coroners-lost-camera-raises-privacy-fears-of-deceased-individuals-in-bc/article25051753/

After a four day trial, the jury convicted Echols of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and six counts of false statements relating to health care matters.   According to evidence presented at trial, Echols was a physician practicing in the Houston area.  The evidence showed that Echols signed plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries so that fraudulent claims could be billed by Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care.  Echols would sign plans of care for Medicare beneficiaries who were not under his care and about whose conditions he had no knowledge.  In many instances, the evidence showed, Echols would sign plans of care even though other doctors were listed as the attending physician on the documents.    Evidence presented at trial showed that Family Healthcare Group Inc. and Houston Compassionate Care fraudulently billed Medicare for home health services and were paid approximately $17.3 million by Medicare, including $5.5 million for beneficiaries for whom Echols signed a plan of care.   At trial, doctors in whose names claims were submitted to Medicare testified that they were treating the patients on plans of care signed by Echols, and that the patients did not need the care that had been billed to Medicare based on the plans. Two Medicare beneficiaries for whom Echols signed plans of care testified at trial that they had never seen Echols, that they had different primary care physicians, and they did not want or need home health care.",http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/December/12-crm-1498.html

The papers did not include personal medical information and so far, there have been no reports that any of the billing data contained in the documents has been misused, according to hospital officials.  St. Elizabeths, in Bostons Brighton neighborhood, released a statement saying it was alerted Feb. 3 by an individual who reported finding papers from the hospital blowing through a field in Charlestown. They contained cashiers receipts for credit card payments made by five patients at St. Elizabeths surgical day center and other outpatient services.  While the individual reported seeing other papers but did not retrieve them, St. Elizabeths said representatives sent to the scene were unable to find any other documents. The hospital is owned by Boston-based Steward Health Care System, a chain of community hospitals.  St. Elizabeths Medical Center had hired certain trusted vendors to begin clearing out the building on Jan. 30, 2012, the hospital said in a statement. All materials containing either a patient name or personal information were supposed to have been shredded.   Hospital officials have no evidence that information for more than five patients was lost, but said they decided to alert all patients whose information had been stored in the office where the five patients records were kept. The receipts found included patients names, hospital account numbers, and credit card numbers, security codes, and expiration dates.  We take patients information very seriously, and were reviewing our policy, and our training procedures to make sure this never happens again, said hospital spokesman Chris Murphy.  The incident marked the second health care data breach in the region in recent weeks. On March 23, CVS Caremark Corp. said it had mistakenly sent letters to about 3,500 Tufts Health Plan members, giving them personal information about the medical conditions and medications of other members enrolled in a supplemental Medicare plan managed by Tufts.

She currently works miles away for a different company.  Kathys worried about the risk for identity theft.  Stephen Miller, of Bridgemark Healthcare, apologized for the clerical error that resulted in approximately 800 plan participants receiving the list with all 800 social security numbers clearly visible.  In a written statement he says,  All impacted individuals are being enrolled in a comprehensive identity theft protection program, in addition to credit monitoring and fraud alert services, at no cost to them.  This coverage is retroactive to the mailing date and will extend for multiple years.  Well stay in touch with the folks at Bridgemark Healthcare about their promise to protect workers.

Following an investigation by OCR, the practice submitted a breach notification to HHS on September 16, 2015, in which it reported that the PHI of approximately 2,075 patients was potentially viewable online, including addresses, dates of birth, names, and clinical information.  In response to the incident, the CE contacted its electronic medical record (""EMR"") hosting company, IOS Health Systems (""IOS""), which immediately secured the information and conducted an internal investigation.  IOS changed the file locations of the practice's EMR records, renamed the file structures, obfuscated file directories, conducted standard security inspections, and began an audit trail review to determine any unauthorized access to the CE's records.  Additionally, the CE ensured that users did not share any documents or links via non-secure methods, changed all passwords for all users, confirmed username and password confidentiality policies with all employees, ensured proper antivirus and spyware applications were installed, and verified that its firewall was properly configured with the latest version of security upgrades.  In response to OCR's investigation, the practice provided evidence that provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals and the media, and offered identity theft protection services.
