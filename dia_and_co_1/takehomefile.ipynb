    "\n",
    "We are a mail-delivery book startup. You fill out a profile with us\n",
    "about your book preferences, and we will send you 5 books each month\n",
    "for free. Whatever you like you keep and pay for, and whatever you\n",
    "don't like you send back. Sound familiar?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a company we have to buy our books ahead of time. We took out a\n",
    "loan last month to buy our original batch of books. The value of the\n",
    "loan was the total cost of all the books that we bought. We made some\n",
    "money back through customers buying our books last month. Next month,\n",
    "we know which books we will be sending to which customers, but we do\n",
    "not know who will buy what books. It costs \\$0.60/book each way for\n",

    "- `original_purchase_order`: Quantity of books originally purchased\n",
    "indexed by a unique product ID. \n",
    "- `next_purchase_order`: Planned quantity\n",
    "of books to purchase at the end of next month indexed by a unique\n",

    "- `customer_features`: Customer features generated by the profiles that\n",

    "knowledge of our books indexed by a unique product ID.\n",

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this test is to assess how well you translate business\n",
    "problems into machine learning solutions as well as get an\n",
    "understanding of your coding ability and style. This is also a chance\n",
    "to give you insights into our business and some problems that we may\n",
    "be thinking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test serves as a minimum bar that we set for interviewing\n",
    "candidates. You do not get extra consideration for going above and\n",
    "beyond the requirements of the test because we do not wish to favor\n",
    "candidates with infinite free time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want to assess your feature engineering prowess or how\n",
    "accurate you can make your machine learning model because we do not\n",
    "want you to spend all day on this. With that being said, you should\n",
    "build valid features and have solid reasoning behind the parameters\n",
    "that you have chosen for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to be respectful of your time. We are not assessing how\n",
    "elaborate your script can be - we do not expect logging or anything\n",
    "like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to spend no more than 3 hours on this assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Your response to this assessment should be a script that can be run on\n",
    "the command line, reads in the necessary data files as arguments to\n",
    "the script, runs the necessary calculations, and finally prints\n",
    "`\"Yes\"` or `\"No\"` to the question of whether or not we can pay back\n",
    "our loan and afford the next book purchase order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how this might be run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python are_we_going_to_survive.py original_purchase_order.csv\n",
    "next_pur chase_order.csv customer_features.csv product_features.csv\n",
    "last_month_as sortment.csv next_month_assortment.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write your script in Python. We use Python for all of our\n",
    "internal data science systems and would like you to be able to\n",
    "integrate yourself as quickly as possible should you start working\n",
    "here. Try to make your code as clean as possible - we suggest\n",
    "following [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0008/)\n",
    "conventions. You should create some sort of machine learning model for\n",
    "answering the question (as\n",
    "opposed to simply looking at average conversion rate or something like\n",
    "that). However, we do not expect you to build models from scratch.\n",
    "`numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and everything else is all fair game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, please write a brief description explaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which machine learning model you chose to use and why\n",
    "\n",
    "- How you validated your model and why you chose to validate it in this\n",
    "way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to run your script (e.g. like the example above).\n"
