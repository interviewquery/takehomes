    "1. **Please review the integrity of the data. Do you notice any data anomalies? If so, please describe them.**  \n",
    "2. **Calculate conversion through the funnel by day such that the data structure is the same as the table at the end of this document** \n",
    "\ta. **Please provide a SQL query you used or would use to calculate the application rate by merchant category (the merchant’s industry provided in `merchants.csv`).**  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provide a set of recommendations on how to improve our business or product based on the attached dataset (assume we have roughly the same market penetration in each so that saturation isn’t a concern and assume revenue to Affirm = (`mdr` + `loan_return_percentage`). Please put together a Jupyter Notebook to the executive team with your recommendation.** \n",
    "\t1. ***This is intended to be fairly open-ended - there's no right or wrong answer. We're more concerned with your approach and the insights you uncover.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose one of the recommendations/insights you uncovered (in #3) and outline one experiment you would like to run to test your suggested product/business recommendation. Please state your hypothesis, describe how you would structure your experiment, list your success metrics and describe the implementation.** \n",
    "4. **Let's assume that the experiment you ran (in #4) proved your hypothesis was true. How would you suggest implementing the change on a larger scale? What are some operational challenges you might encounter and how would you mitigate their risk?** \n",
