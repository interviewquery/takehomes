    "# Home Listing Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Background​\n",
    " Knowing which home listings to recommend to\n",
    " a guest could provide huge business value to Airbnb. Therefore, ​we\n",
    " would like to train a recommender model that can predict which\n",
    " listings specific user is likely to book​. The dataset provided here\n",
    " contains a random sample of our 7-day search log from two markets: Rio\n",
    " de Janeiro and Sao Paulo\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a user conducts a search they are shown certain number of\n",
    "listings that are available for the searched location, dates and search\n",
    "filters. Given the search results, the user can conduct one or more\n",
    "action on a specific listing: impress (no action), click (which takes\n",
    "user to listing page), contact host (to inquire about listing) and\n",
    "finally book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each row in the dataset is one of the listings that is a result of a\n",
    "    search conducted by a user (identified with `id_search`)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each row has a `label` that tells us what is the ultimate action\n",
    "    performed on the listing: `impression`, `click`, `host_contact` or `book`.\n",
    "    Keep in mind that we use the latest action as label. Therefore, if\n",
    "    label is contact host, it means that before that user also did an\n",
    "    impression and click. Or if the label is book, the user also did\n",
    "    impression and click on the listing and may have contacted the host\n",
    "    (if `ds_contact` is present) or may have just directly booked without\n",
    "    contacting the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Listings are uniquely defined using `id_listing` field in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Searcher (Booker) is uniquely defined using `id_user` field in the\n",
    "    dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features \n",
    "The features can be categorized into the\n",
    "following groups:​\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Query Features: (location, check-in & check-out dates and filters\n",
    "    such as number of guests, etc​: (they start with `query_*` in the\n",
    "    dataset). These are features related to user's search query\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Listing Features:​ (they start with `listing_*` in the dataset)\n",
    "    These are various attributes of the listings (such as price, review\n",
    "    count, review rating, location, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 72 hours to play with the data\n",
    "and tackle the problem using machine learning to build a recommender\n",
    "system for a specific searcher. The requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Build a model that will be able to recommend the most relevant\n",
    "    (bookable) listings to users for the given search parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can formulate the problem as a ​**ranking problem**​ or a ​**top-$K$ recommendation problem**​ as long as you can justify your choice and\n",
    "    test the recommendation model using applicable metics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Start with a baseline model that is more than a random guess and see\n",
    "    how much you can improve from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Show how you evaluate and improve your model performance. Explain\n",
    "    your choice of evaluation technique. Since this is a\n",
    "    recommendation/ranking problem that we are addressing, use at least\n",
    "    one metric that tests how well you rank or recommend at top-$K$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Using the provided dataset, derive additional features to\n",
    "    demonstrate your data sense and creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Note that no user personalization features are provided in the\n",
    "    dataset. Leverage `id_user` within the search data to derive at least\n",
    "    one feature that captures users' historical preferences for use in\n",
    "    your recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What consequences does your model have on new listings? Are they\n",
    "    recommended enough? How would you change the recommendation model\n",
    "    such that you optimize not only for bookings in general but for\n",
    "    bookings of new listings as well\n",
    "-  Demonstrate your approach and\n",
    "    evaluate it using a metric of choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Identify opportunities of using your model in Airbnb's marketplace.\n",
    "    For what purposes could it be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Please submit one document and provide code and a writeup (e.g. in R\n",
    "    Markdown or iPython Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In order to minimize unconscious bias in our review process, please\n",
    "    don't include your name or any identifying personal details in your\n",
    "    submission.\n",

    "# Explanation of features \n",
    "Below find a table of original\n",
    " features provided to you. It is very useful to read the descriptions\n",
    " to understand the meaning behind each features. Reading the\n",
    " descriptions will also help you come up with derived features. Note\n",
    " that some of the features (such as dates) you can't directly use in\n",
    " modeling but you can use them to build very useful derived features.\n",
