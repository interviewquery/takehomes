    "You are selling certain items at your store. Every once in a while you may experience shortage. In which case, you notify your customers when your inventory will be replenished. You want to know which percent of your customers are not waiting for the replenishment and buying the item elsewhere - lost sales due to shortage. (Note that some do wait for your replenishment which is expressed as a higher demand at the day of replenishment).\n",
