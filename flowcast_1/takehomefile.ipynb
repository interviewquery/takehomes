    "You will use credit card transactions data to detect fraud. Fraud can\n",
    "take many forms, whether it is someone stealing a single credit card, to\n",
    "large batches of stolen credit card numbers being used on the web, or\n",
    "even a mass compromise of credit card numbers stolen from a merchant via\n",
    "tools like credit card skimming devices. Note that this dataset loosely\n",
    "resembles real transactional data, but the entities and relations within\n",
    "are purely fictional. Please complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Load the data in `transactions.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Briefly describe the data structure, provide summary statistics, and\n",
    "    at least one plot.  ",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Build a model to determine whether a given transaction is fraudulent\n",
    "    or not. Each of the transactions in the dataset has a field called\n",
    "    isFraud.  ",
    "\n",

    "    1.  Hint: This task should involve some feature engineering although\n",

    "\n",
    "    3.  Conclusions about your solution ",
