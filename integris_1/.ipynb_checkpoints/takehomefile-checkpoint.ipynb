    "A large portion of the role will be analyzing supervised/semi-supervised models. One way to do this is through error analysis. One way to conduct error analysis is gather a sample of N dev set examples that your system misclassified. (I.e., examples that your system made an error on.) Then in a spreadsheet, add columns for attributes that the misclassified examples may have and keep count. You may also add a comments column for uneasy to categorize attributes.\n",
