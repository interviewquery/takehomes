    "# TAKE-HOME CHALLENGE: Data Science - Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is a two-sided marketplace that matches guests to hosts. The\n",
    "booking flow at Airbnb is as follows: a guest finds an available room\n",
    "(listing) that they like, and then they contact the host. Once the guest\n",
    "finds a listing they are interested in, there are three ways to send the\n",
    "host an inquiry: `contact_me`, `book_it`, or `instant_book` (detailed at\n",
    "the bottom of this document). Upon receiving the inquiry, the host can\n",
    "then decide whether or not to accept the request (for `contact_me` and\n",
    "`book_it` methods; `instant_book` is auto-accepted). One of our\n",
    "goals at Airbnb is to increase bookings on our platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "You are the first data scientist to join a cross-functional Product and\n",
    "Operations team working to grow bookings in Rio de Janeiro. The team\n",
    "asks you for help with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What key metrics would you propose to monitor over time the success\n",
    "    of the team's efforts in improving the guest host matching process\n",
    "    and why? Clearly define your metric(s) and explain how each is\n",
    "    computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What areas should we invest in to increase the number of successful\n",
    "    bookings in Rio de Janeiro? What segments are doing well and what\n",
    "    could be improved? ​ ​Propose 2-3 specific recommendations (business\n",
    "    initiatives and product changes) that could address these\n",
    "    opportunities. Demonstrate rationale behind each recommendation AND\n",
    "    prioritize your recommendations in order of their estimated impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  There is also interest from executives at Airbnb in the work you\n",
    "    are doing, and a desire to understand the broader framing of the\n",
    "    challenge of matching supply and demand, thinking beyond the data\n",
    "    provided. What other research, experiments, or approaches could help\n",
    "    the company get more clarity on the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment \n",
    "S​ummarize your recommendations in response to the questions above in a Jupyter Notebook intended for\n",
    "the Head of Product and VP of Operations (who is not technical). Include\n",
    "an organized appendix sharing the details of your work conducted for the\n",
    "Rio team, that would be useful for the data team to understand your\n",
    "work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment will be judged according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The analytical approach and clarity of your graphs, tables,\n",
    "    visualizations,\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The data decisions you made and reproducibility of the analysis,\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Strength of recommendations, prioritizations, and rationale behind\n",
    "    those,\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The narrative of your presentation and ability to effectively\n",
    "    communicate to non-technical executives, 5) How well you followed\n",
    "    the directions.\n",

    "## Further Information\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to book a listing on Airbnb:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  `contact_me` -​ The guests writes a message to the host to inquire\n",
    "    about the listing. The host has the option to 1) pre-​approve the\n",
    "    guest to book their place, or 2) they can reject, or 3) they can\n",
    "    write a free text message with no explicit acceptance or rejection.\n",
    "    If the host pre-​approves, the guest can then go ahead and click to\n",
    "    make the booking (but is not obligated to).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  `book_it` ​- The guest puts money down to book the place directly,\n",
    "    but the host has to accept the reservation request. If the host\n",
    "    accepts, the booking happens automatically. If you have used Airbnb\n",
    "    before, this shows up as a button labeled \"Request to book\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  `instant_book`​ -​ The guest books the listing directly, without any\n",
    "    need for the host to accept or reject actively (it is auto​-accepted\n",
    "    by the host). This shows up as a button labeled \"Book\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note​ \n",
    "A host can opt-in to the `instant_book` feature. If a host\n",
    "does so, a guest can use the `contact_me` or `instant_book` channels\n",
    "for booking that particular listing, but cannot use the `book_it`\n",
    "functionality. Alternatively, if a host does not opt in, a guest can use\n",
    "the `contact_me` or `book_it` channels only. We suggest that you\n",
    "browse the Airbnb website and look at listings to see the different ways\n",
    "that you can message a host.\n"
