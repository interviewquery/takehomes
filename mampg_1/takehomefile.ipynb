    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years ago, MAPMG opened a new inpatient wing at the Maryland Hospital for Data Scientists (MHDS).\n",
    "For the first few months, everything was fine - but then, some of the new physicians began reporting\n",
    "that they were having days where they were getting overwhelmed.  The hospital is currently staffed\n",
    "with 15 doctors, each of whom is expected to work with about 10 patients per day.  Since the average\n",
    "patient census (number of patients in the hospital on a given day) is around 150, some members of the management\n",
    "team are inclined to disregard these complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physicians and management have asked you to investigate whether there are strong indicators that the\n",
    "physicians are getting overworked, and they've settled on a metric that is important to the bottom line:\n",
    "patient discharges.  Some physicians have reported that the discharge process can be very difficult\n",
    "to manage during busy days.  This can lead to a spiral where physicians have to triage more and more\n",
    "cases, preventing them from discharging complex patients, but then they have even more patients to deal\n",
    "with the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lead physician at the hospital would like you to investigate whether the amount\n",
    "of work at the hospital (i.e. the number of patients) affects the discharge rate.  If so, then \n",
    "management would like to know how large an effect this has, since that will determine how cost\n",
    "effective it would be to call in additional physicians on busy days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physicians have given you the following directives to help guide your analysis:\n",
    "- Some patients are relatively simple, and these cases take very little time to discharge;\n",
    "you can expect that patients with only a few days in the hospital won't be affected.\n",
    "- The physicians believe that they're really having trouble when they have to deal with 10\n",
    "or more patients each, and 8 patients each feels like a very manageable number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a dataset (`hospital_sim`) with patient admission and discharge dates (encoded as integers which count the days\n",
    "from the hospital's opening).  This data includes records for 20,000 patients over the two year period.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the data that you have available right now doesn't include information about\n",
    "the patient's health state or why the patient was in the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "The physicians and management would like to see your results during their meeting in 2 weeks.  While the\n",
    "physicians accept that they may be wrong about this analysis, they'll require some convincing.  If you\n",
    "find no evidence of a correlation between busy days and the hospital's discharge rate, you'll need to\n",
    "demonstrate that your search was exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the physicians are correct, then management would like you to estimate how many patient-days are being\n",
    "added by this effect.  In other words, how many patients are being affected and how many extra days did those\n",
    "patients spend in the hospital because of this?  This is important because management would like to\n",
    "be able to run a cost-benefit analysis for hiring new physicians.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate your findings, please include your source code and a short write-up of your findings, including\n",
    "an executive summary and supporting evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python as your primary development/analytical tool."
