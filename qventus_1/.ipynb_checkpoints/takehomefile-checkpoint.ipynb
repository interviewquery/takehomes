    "\n",
    "The purpose of this task is to get a feel for your understanding of how\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the datasets and background provided below, please answer the\n",
    "questions below. Most people use SQL and/or Python, but feel free to use\n",
    "whatever's most comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that describing your approach and explaining any limitations or\n",
    "shortcomings is as important as the code.\n",

    "Given the table schema above, please provide the logic/statement(s) that\n",
    "you would use to address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What percentage of patient visits are still admitted or not\n",
    "    discharged yet from the hospital?\n",
    "2.  Length of stay or LOS is a calculated metric that measures the total\n",
    "    number of midnights between the admit_time and the discharge_time or\n",
    "    current time, if the patient is still admitted. What is the Median\n",
    "    LOS by admit_class for encounters admitted in the month of June?\n",
    "3.  We received a question from a client asking if LOS has gone down\n",
    "    after Jan. 1 of this year, normalizing for things like seasonality\n",
    "    and other factors (your choice). Can you describe how you would\n",
    "    write a script / model to evaluate this? Please be as explicit as\n",
    "    possible (some code would be great!).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 2: Storytelling Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "*Time: 1.5 hours*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this challenge is to explain how you would analyze\n",
    "whether or not a machine learning model is creating real-world impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the background provided below, please outline an \"analytics story\"\n",
    "which would show as conclusively as possible that our model is \"working\"\n",
    "as expected (i.e., having a real-world impact on hospital operations).\n",
    "Please use data visualizations to help illustrate the story. Feel free\n",
    "to use slides, a document, hand drawings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you're going to present this analysis to a customer who's\n",
    "pretty savvy about data, but not a machine learning engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, please point out where you think your assumptions / analysis might\n",
    "be inconclusive, or where you'd have further questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "One of our models predicts when a \"surge\" is going to happen in an\n",
    "emergency department. It will \"fire\" if, in the next few hours, we\n",
    "predict that the emergency department census will exceed a critical\n",
    "threshold (the threshold can vary per hospital, depending on the\n",
    "emergency department's size).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a regression model, but it only \"fires\" if it predicts that\n",
    "census will cross the threshold (so in some sense, it acts as a\n",
    "classifier in the way the output is produced).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the model may be wrong on occasion (either the census\n",
    "isn't going to be as bad as we think, or the model doesn't fire early\n",
    "enough, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model \"fires,\" a number of people at the hospital (emergency\n",
    "department director, charge nurses, hospitalists, transporters, cleaning\n",
    "staff, etc.) will all be looped into a communication thread through our\n",
    "applications to help mitigate the bottleneck before it forms (think of a\n",
    "group chat). In its simplest form, the message from Qventus that kicks\n",
    "off the thread might be something like \"High census expected in next 3\n",
    "hours. ED, please reply with needs.\" Hospital staff might then respond\n",
    "to that nudge and/or take actions like expediting cleaning of rooms,\n",
    "working to get patients discharged faster or transported more quickly,\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other pieces of context\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We usually have a large amount of historical data that can be used\n",
    "    to baseline.\n",
    "-   Think about how you'd show causality here. How can we get as close\n",
    "    as possible to proving that our intervention is what's driving\n",
    "    operational improvement?\n",
    "-   Remember that there may be multiple steps in the journey of proving\n",
    "    impact here. For example: is the model predicting events correctly?\n",
    "    Are users engaging with the output? Is an operational outcome being\n",
    "    achieved? And more...\n",
    "-   Assume that we have all the data you'd need to tell this story\n",
    "    (including all operational data from the hospital).\n"
