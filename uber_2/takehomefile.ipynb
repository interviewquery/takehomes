    "## Question 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber has several different products (varying by city); for instance, in New York City, it offers uberX, uberXL, UberBLACK, and UberSUV.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases Uber practices \"cross-dispatch\"; e.g., generally a driver/vehicle for uberXL can also accept uberX trips. In specific cities, UberBLACK (or equivalent) drivers will be sent uberX requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about ways in which cross dispatch might make querying Uber's data complicated. Write a paragraph or two about common types of analyses that might fail if the researcher didn't think carefully enough about cross dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "[If it matters, assume Vertica 9.0; feel free to look up the documentation. Don't worry about syntax errors in the queries below, as these queries are known to run]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Uber data warehouse stores records on cities and trips in tables named cities and trips, respectively. Uber offers different products in different cities; each city-product, e.g., UberBLACK in New York City, is a distinct \"vehicle view\". When a user requests a trip, the product requested for that trip is recorded in column `request_vehicle_view_id` (which joins to a table, `vehicle_views`, on the `vehicle_views.id` column).\n",
