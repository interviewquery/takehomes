	THOMAS ISARANKURA		Revision to permit 6380136: We have made the following changes to the floor plans, all of which have impacted the structural foundation, framing plans and details, in addition to the architectural elevations and sections drawings.1. The dumbwaiter has been removed and an elevator has been added in place of it, thus resulting in reconfiguring the floor plans on all floors and changes to associated structure. 2. Additional floor area has been added to the north side of the basement level floorplan. Our original plan was to retain the existing concrete foundation wall along the north side but decided against it after discovering that wall was in very poor condition. Removing it altogether in addition to surrounding soil provided the owners with an additional 292sf of heated area.3. Roof level floor plan has been change per owners request in order to take full advantage of the views and usable roof deck areas. 184sf of heated area has been removed on the south side between gridline 3 and 5 and replace with outdoor deck area. 247sf of heated area has been added to the west side, west of gridline B. There are no changes to the top of ridge elevation.	SINGLE FAMILY / DUPLEX
