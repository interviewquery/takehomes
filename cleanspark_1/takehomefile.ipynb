    "\n",
    "It is commonly accepted that code without tests is bad code. For that\n",
    "reason, all production code is thoroughly tested at CleanSpark. Python\n",
    "code is verified using the `pytest` package. The good news is, we had\n",

    "We need to make sure you know how to run the tests we have\n",
    "written. Run the following command inside of your virtual environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "!python -m pytest\n",

    "You should see that all the tests\n",
    "are  failing. It is your job to get these tests to pass by writing\n",

    "# Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "## Energy and Power\n",
    "\n",
    "At CleanSpark we analyze electricity bills every day. In general, an\n",
    "electricity bill is composed of two primary parts: energy charges and\n",
    "maximum-power (demand) charges. In order to understand these two\n",
    "portions of the bill, we must first understand the difference between\n",
    "energy and power.\n",
    "\n",
    "One helpful analogy is between electricity consumption and driving\n",
    "your car. In order to understand this better, let's use a concrete\n",
    "example. Imagine you want to drive from San Diego to San Francisco this\n",
    "weekend. After checking Google Maps, you know that you need to travel\n",
    "roughly 500 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's assume someone asked you how long it will take you to get\n",
    "to San Francisco. What would you say? ... Hopefully, you thought to\n",
    "yourself, I don't have enough information. I need to know how fast\n",
    "I am driving in order to know how long it will take.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because time and distance require a speed (or rate) to convert\n",
    "between the two. You may recall the familiar definition of a rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rm speed = \\frac{\\rm distance}{\\rm time}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume I also told you that you will be traveling at an average\n",
    "speed of 60 mph over your 500 mile journey to San Francisco and then\n",
    "asked you how long it would take. Using our definition of speed (rate)\n",
    "we can easily calculate the time required to get to San Francisco:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm time} = \\frac{\\rm distance}{\\rm speed} = \\frac{\\rm 500 \\, miles}{\\rm 60 \\, mph} = \\rm{8.\\bar{3} \\, h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending the example above to electricity we can say that energy is\n",
    "to distance what power is to speed. However the units can be a bit\n",
    "tricky. Energy is measured in kWh and power is measured in kW. In\n",
    "order to provide some more context, let\\'s assume a building consumed\n",
    "50 kWh over a 30 minute period and I asked you what the averave power\n",
    "was. Well extending our formula from above:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm power} = \\frac{\\rm energy}{\\rm time} = \\frac{\\rm 50 \\, kWh}{\\rm 0.5 \\, h} = {\\rm 100 \\, kW}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Now that you understand energy and power we can discuss how energy\n",
    "bills are typically calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Electricity bills\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, energy bills have two primary components: energy\n",
    "and max-power (demand). These two portions are calculated in\n",
    "completely different ways. We will first discuss energy and then\n",
    "max-power (demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy rates have units of $\\$$/kWh and are calculated at every 15\n",
    "minute interval. For example, if the energy rate is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\$0.01$/kWh and the building consumed 100 kWh of energy over that 15\n",
    "minute interval, they are charged $\\$1.00$. This occurs at every 15\n",
    "minute interval in the month and all of the charges get summed up.\n",
    "This sum of energy charges is the energy portion of your bill.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This operation is very similar to a dot product.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Max-power (demand) rates have units of $\\$$/kW and are calculated only\n",
    "once per month. For example, for an entire month of data let\\'s assume\n",
    "the maximum average power (demand) in a single interval was 100 kW and\n",
    "the demand rate is $\\$$20/kW.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer would be they are charged \\$2000 once for that month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a month electricity consumption data (kWh) in 15 minute\n",
    "intervals for a commercial facility located in San Diego, CA. This data\n",
    "can be read into a pandas DataFrame using the pre-coded `_get_data`\n",
    "function in the cell below. Each interval is labeled with the\n",
    "time it began and all intervals are 15 minutes long. Your task is to\n",
    "add logic to the two stubbed functions in the cell below module. The\n",
    "first method is called `energy_charge` and the second is called `demand_charge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example pricing scheme (electricity tariff) is outlined below. Your\n",
    "functions will need to use the electricity consumption data and the\n",
    "pricing scheme to calculate the energy and demand charges. Please feel\n",
    "free to import any other third party packages you think you will need. In additions, feel free to\n",
    "write as many extra helper functions as you need and include them in\n",
    "the cell below file as well.\n",

    "## Correct Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You will know if you have implemented the logic correctly when you run\n",
    "your tests and both of them pass.\n",
